###Backstory
####History of the Qiang Clan
Many generations ago, the lands now known as The Abandoned Domain were suffering a period of turmoil. The Empire that once controlled these lands had fallen, and now its carcass was being torn apart by minor warlords in a series of civil wars. Those of you that study history, realize that it’s a common occurrence. After all, the empire long united must divide. This is how it has always been. But it is also true that the one that has been long divided must unite.

And so, one warlord rose above the others and untied those lands. He has not done it alone, of course. The one important to this story is not him, but one of those who supported his rise to rulership. In particular, one known as Golden General Qiang.

Qiang was a nomad that came from the steps on the borders of the Empire. His people lived between three minor kingdoms that built themselves up using the bones of the old nation, each of their rulers more ambitious than the last. War was an inevitability. Suffering of the nomads on its path followed naturally.

Qiang could not stand looking at the destruction of his people, so he set out on a journey. He sought two things: one who could bring prosperity to these lands, and the strength to support him in that endeavour.

He found the latter quickly. His talents were many, and he quickly rose to fame as a cultivator. He mastered a multitude of techniques and excelled in the three systems. His knowledge of tactics and strategy was second to none. He discovered that he is a descendant of the Golden Virtue Blood Sovereign, and earned himself the title of the Golden Qiang. Many expected him to reach for the power himself, yet he did not. He knew that the one talent he lacked, was that for rulership.

Finding the master worthy of servitude was a long and arduous process. Many a man tried to get the Golden Qiang as his vassal, but none of them proved themselves virtuous in his eyes. All that wanted to employ him proved themselves greedy, selfish or inept. After many years, finally, Qiang found one in whom he believed he could trust. His chosen master was but a boy from a small village, ravaged by the fires of war, yet in his short meeting with Qiang he displayed clarity of mind and purity of soul such that Qiang found even Taoist sages he studied under to pale in comparison.

And so, he proposed to the boy to make him an Emperor. The boy refused, saying he didn’t want to rule. Qiang replied that those who don’t seek power are those that deserve it the most, and implored him again. The boy refused once more, saying that he is too young and lacks the skills required of the one who would rule over others. Qiang replied that him knowing he is lacking is the very step to gaining knowledge and offered to teach him the skills he can, and help find the teachers who will teach him the rest. Hearing that, the boy contemplated upon it for a week, but finally agreed.

A decade passed, during which Qiang and the boy went on a journey not dissimilar to the one that Qiang set out on many years ago. The boy was an eager and talented learner, praised as a genius by many. After but mere ten years, Qiang decided that the time of learning was over, and it was now the time to act.

And so, they set out on a campaign after a campaign, subjugating a kingdom after a kingdom, until the lands were as one again. Qiang’s title expanded, now he was famous as the Golden General Qiang, the one who serves the Brilliant Emperor. Harmony has been restored and an era of peace began.

But nothing lasts forever. Golden General Qiang lived long, serving the Brilliant Emperor and then his successors, but death caught to him in the end. His descendants, named after him as the clan of Qiang, were trying to take his place upon his passing. Powerful cultivators in their own right, they however lacked the reputation that kept the wolves at bay.

Other courtiers feared their position, and conspired against them. Generation after generation, the line of Qiang was fought in the arena of politics, where they were at their weakest. Finally, the conspirators decided that the time had come. They managed to damage the Qiang line’s spirit root and strip them of their titles. The grandsons of the one, who helped build the Empire, were cast out.

Not many years after, the empire has fallen, torn apart by the very clans that brought ruin to the Qiang. Now its remains can be found only among some minor domains beholden to kingdoms, beholden to “empires” that once were one.

And the Qiang were brought to obscurity. They watched as what their forefather had built crumbled into dust. Their spirit root damaged, they did what they could to strengthen their clan, but generation after generation, they grew weaker. In the end, the once famous Golden Clan fell into obscurity along with the Empire they built and served.

The Qiang Clan now lives modestly, desperately clinging to what they have left, in their estate not much bigger than a mortal’s house, worried more about the past and holding on to what they have left than taking back what’s theirs.

####Life of Qiang Wei
It’s in such circumstances that twenty years ago Qiang Wei was born. Even if his spirit root was damaged like that of his ancestors, he displayed talents for other disciplines not seen inside his family for hundreds of years.

Qiang Wei’s parents themselves were cultivators of mediocre skills and talents, but their love and hopes for their child were great. For his sake, they decided to do what’s in their powers to help him restore the glory of the Qiang. Leaving young Wei, under the care and mentorship of his grandfather, they set out on a journey hoping to find something that could help restore Wei’s root, or at least aid him in some other way.

After a decade, only his father returned. Mortally wounded, he carried in his arms a spear with a tip of purest jade. His last act was passing it onto his son, and telling him that while he himself was unable to use it, Wei just might be able to. With grief painting on his face, Wei listened to the father he had not seen for so long bless him with his last breath, and promised to do what’s in his powers to become a son he might be proud of.

The moment he closed his father’s eyes, a single tear rolled down Qiang Wei’s cheek and fell onto the spear lying in his lap. At that moment, the Spear shone brightly and the young cultivator felt a gentle embrace wrapping around him.

When he turned his head, he met the eyes of a beautiful woman. One might have expected him to be surprised, but at this moment already, a bond has been already formed between the two. The moment he tied his life with this treasure his parents paid for with their lives, he already understood how great she was. She might not restore his spirit root, but with her at his side, he knew he did not need it. The two stayed like that for some time, and then set out to bury his father.

Five years have passed since that day to now. During that time, Qiang Wei and Qiang Yunu, as the girl came to be called, trained hard under the guidance of his grandfather, but now it has been decided that he had no more to teach him. In the spirit of the Golden General, it was time for the couple to set out on the journey of learning and discovery.

###Personality
Qiang Wei has a serious disposition. He tries to be methodical in all his actions, and rarely gives in to emotions. He feels that growing as a cultivator is his duty towards his parents and the rest of the Qiang clan, and will do what’s in his power to strive towards that goal. He has a tendency to treat everything as his responsibility, and sometimes, ends up taking upon himself more than he should, but thanks to Yunu it doesn’t happen too often.

####Tao
**Tao of the Jade Tipped Spear of the Wandering Songstress**
Qiang Wei’s Tao is a reflection of his bond with Qiang Yunu. His trust in her is boundless. He believes that given time, as long as she’s by his side, and he gives it his all, there is no challenge they won’t be able to meet nor a level they won’t be able to rise to. Yunu once said that to truly understand him, one must see him in combat. His very being is the expression of his obsession with elevating his skill with the Spear to its utmost limit.

####Ruthless Warrior
In Qiang Wei’s mind, there is no other combat than that to the death. Learning the stories of his ancestors, he doesn’t believe that cultivators have the luxury to afford mercy for their enemies, nor one to expect it from them. He also doesn’t believe in practising by “play fighting”. One shouldn’t strike without the intention to kill. It dulls one’s instincts, and is disrespectful to their skills and weapons.

Because of that, Qiang Wei will avoid combat when he doesn’t believe it is absolutely necessary. To strike a blow is to be prepared to kill or be killed, so one must be sure that the prize is worth the price.

###Fighting Style
Qiang Wei is a very defensive fighter. At the centre of all his combat tactics is the Spear, all others are only supportive to it. With it in hands, he will try to methodically whittle down his opponent’s defences while keeping up his own until a moment where an opening reveals itself.

//Standard tactic is keeping Endurance, Footwork, Barrier and the Scenery (Detection) running at all times in combat for max defensive capabilities, and then use the ability from the second style for offence. Often at the beginning of the fight he will summon aid with the Bloodline (Summoning), and then go into the Barrage (or Attack depending on the enemy and range) to tire out his opponent and create openings, and then if a suitable one presents itself, using the Ambush or Reversal to end it.

####Crippled Talent (Qi)

Qiang Wei suffers from the weakness running down his clan. His dantian is inert and, as a result, he is unable to gather nor use Qi and is forced to rely only on the strength of his Body and Soul.

####Perfect Efficiency & The Way of Killing
Thanks to his mindset and experience from body cultivation, his style is free of any useless movements. Each strike executed with the death of the enemy in mind. It’s not a flashy style, quite the opposite of it, but there is some terrible beauty in its efficiency.

###Treasure
####“Jade Tipped Spear of the Wandering Songstress” - 天涯歌女之玉尖槍 - Tiānyá Gēnǚ zhī Yùjiān Qiāng
*From the end of the earth, to the farthest sea, I search and search for my heart's companion*

A spear of [a legend long forgotten](https://rentry.org/spearfuLegend).

With a tip of purest jade, this weapon is of clearly divine craftsmanship, but doesn’t normally seem to display any powers beyond a magical attribute of space. The Spear seems impossibly sharp, but in fact, she never truly touches her targets; they seem to naturally give way to her, shying away from blocking her path, as a result, leaving her spotless even after bloody battles.

However, when bonded with the right wielder, the Spear’s true potential can be unleashed. Her control over space far broader than one could have suspected. Her power seems such, that with it, even crossing barriers between realms might be possible.

The Spear possesses a treasure spirit, or rather is a form that a spirit of a woman known as Qiāng Yùnǚ (槍玉女) takes. The title is but a pseudonym used in place of her forgotten real name, for she seems to have no recollection of her past. Despite this, she is a bright and cheerful person. She’s filled with curiosity, and eager to learn about this world and create new memories with her chosen companion.

//An important element of the build even if not technically an Immortal Armament, since a lot of techniques, including Fated Encounter based, are fluffed through her. Mechanically the treasure itself is quite mundane, with it just being a top tier spear with a spirit and life-bond. Doesn’t have special inscriptions (most of her magic is done as techniques), and the mundane inscription effect is just a magical attribute of space that makes the point extra sharp as it splits the space in front of it rather than just cutting (for aesthetics effect, this results in the spear never really getting covered in blood cause she never actually touches what she splits).


###Bloodline
####“Legions of the Golden General” – royal bloodline of the Qiáng
*He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout all its ranks.*

One's life is the continuation of one's parents' life. The bloodlines are an expression of that. They are the strength built over many generations, the proof that your ancestors are still with you.

Among those who learn this lesson most intimately, are descendants of the Golden General Qiang, in his times a famous cultivator and supposedly one of the heirs of the Golden Virtue Blood Sovereign. By invoking their bloodline ability and sharing the life energy that animates them, members of this lineage can summon spectres of their ancestors to fight by their side as if they were alive once again, creating an army with a bond stronger than that of any other. And they know that one day, it might be their turn to come when called by their descendants.

Breaking the barrier between the realms of the living and the dead, including one that’s so far from true resurrection, is normally beyond the abilities of most cultivators. Even for members of the Qiang lineage, over the generations, this ability became more and more difficult to use, in time even losing its royal status. However, thanks to Qiang Yunu, Qiang Wei managed to reawaken its original might. After bonding with her, he found out that she can act as a conduit between the realms, greatly enhancing his ability to summon the spirits and brining this bloodline to its rightful royal status.

//The ability is a summoning technique, which materializes spirits of one’s ancestors to fight besides you. The user’s Body Cultivation Realm affects the number of the spirits summoned and how much of their original strength they have available. Over the generations it dropped to the noble status, but thanks to Qiang Yunu, it got restored to its royal level.


###Soul Scenery
####“Nine Halls of the Jade Glory” – soul scenery of Qiāng Yùnǚ
*The scholar does not consider gold and jade to be precious treasures, but loyalty and good faith.* 

The Soul Palace where Qiang Yunu resides when not materializing her spirit form. It was formed when she and Qiang Wei bonded. There are nine halls inside the palace ground, set in sequential orders, reaching deeper inside the bonded souls of the couple, with the ninth hall standing at their very centre. To enter each Hall, one must pass the gates barring entrance to it to those uninvited. The gates are guarded by statues of mythical creates and the ancestors of Qiang clan. With one exception, each hall and gate are grander, more ornately decorated with jade, and better protected than the last one.

The first gate, guarded by a statue of a dragon, is the Gate of Sincerity. Behind it stands the first hall, called The Hall of Hospitality. Qiang Yunu’s curiosity makes her seek connections with Mind Seas of any person near Qiang Wei. Her care for him urges her to warn him if she detects any ill intent inside them. Otherwise, they are welcome to enter this Hall that acts as a reception for guests.

The second gate, guarded by a statue of a phoenix, is the Gate of Benevolence. Behind it stands the second hall called The Golden Sun Hall. Rather than a palatial hall, it is in fact a garden filled with fantastical sights and richly decorated pavilions. It’s the favourite place of Qiang Yunu to spend time in, when she’s apart from Qiang Wei.

The third gate, guarded by a statue of a lion, is the Gate of Bravery. Behind it stands the third hall, called The Hall of Mortal Struggle. At its centre is the arena where Qiang Wei practices his bodily cultivation, the rest of the Hall serves mostly as the guardhouse for the ancestral spirits protecting the Palace. The gate is guarded by a statue of a lion.

The fourth gate, guarded by a statue of a sea horse, is the Gate of Filial Piety.  Behind it stands the fourth hall, called The Ancestral Hall of Qiang. Architecturally, it’s a much more austere of a building than the other halls, resembling a cross between a pagoda and a watchtower. It’s dwarfed in size, and its only decorations are gilded ancestral tablets. This is where Qiang Wei and Qiang Yunu come to pay their respects, and summon the spirits needed for cultivation and protection of the Palace.

The fifth gate, guarded by a statue of a heavenly steed, is the Gate of Wisdom. Behind it stands the fifth hall, called The Hall of Understanding. This is where Qiang Wei cultivates his soul. It resembles archives and is filled with a large number of scrolls representing the wisdom of his ancestors’ teachings.

The sixth gate, guarded by a statue of Yayu, is the Gate of Righteousness. Behind it stands the sixth hall called The Hall. This hall is one where spiritual avatars of close friends might be invited. It consists of a variety of rooms aimed at receiving guests and relaxing.

The seventh gate, guarded by a statue of Suanni, is the Gate of Propriety. Behind it stands the seventh hall, called The Hall of Comfort. It resembles the sixth hall, but only Qiang Wei, Qiang Yunu and the ancestral spirits are allowed inside.

The eighth gate, guarded by a statue of Xiezhi, is the Gate of Loyalty. Behind it stands the eighth hall, called The Hall of Privacy. Only Qiang Wei and Qiang Yunu are allowed inside. Their private rooms are located here, and if they were asked about “home”, this is the space they’d think of.

The ninth and final gate, is guarded by two statues, one of Douniu and one of Xingshi, but no ancestral spirits, is the Gate of Unknown. Behind it stands the ninth and final hall, called The Forbidden Hall. This hall, standing at the very centre of the couple’s souls, is grander than all the others combined, but the jade gates to it are closed even to the Qiang Wei and Qiang Yunu, the only thing that passes through them is the golden light emanating from the inside.


//The bond ability is the first hall effect, basically a soul-based detection technique. Forms bonds with nearby people and warns the wielder if hostility is detected. If the target is too far, his Mind Sea too well protected, or his intent too well hidden, it won’t work. Works a bit like a spidey sense, but needs a person or a creature (with a mind developed enough to connect to) to be the one posing danger. The rest is for fluff and parts of other techniques. Ancestral spirits here aren’t Soul Spirits, they are summoned through the bloodline ability and don’t grant mechanical benefits not covered by other techniques, their “guarding effect” is general soul-based resistance and the Attack technique.


###Cultivation Techniques
####“Ancestral Guidance Invocation” – Soul Refining - Grade 10
*To forget one's ancestors is to be a brook without a source, a tree without root. Study the past if you would define the future.*

A technique passed down the Qiang clan. It is in fact a form of ancestral veneration. By studying one’s ancestors and paying proper respects to them, one can grow in a multitude of ways. Contemplating on people of the past lets one understand better the nature of souls. Ancestors grateful for worship will share their blessings with their grandchildren. Learning about grandfathers’ deeds will help one develop the skills needed to replicate them.

However, under normal circumstances, this technique is subpar in terms of cultivation speed when compared to most soul refining methods. Luckily for Qiang Wei, the circumstances for him aren’t normal. He doesn’t need to spend years studying old archives nor make prayers that will go unanswered. Thanks to his awakened bloodline and Qiang Yunu, he can contact and learn from the spirits of his ancestors directly in his Soul Palace. Under their guidance, and thanks to the fact he’s regularly interacting with spirits, this technique is elevated to new heights, few others being able to surpass its prowess.

//Ancestral Veneration themed. Meditating to enter the Palace inside the Mind Sea, cultivating under ancestors’ guidance, strengthening one’s soul and learning skills and techniques they excelled at. In its base form, it’s very low grade (like 3), where it’s mostly just meditating on ancestors’ deeds and history. With the reawakened bloodline and spearfu acting as a medium, the true potential of this technique is unleashed and it achieves grade 10. On higher realms, more powerful ancestors from times further past can be summoned.


####“Nine Thousand Four Hundred Thirteen Ancestral Challenges” – Body Tempering - Grade 11
*If the father is a tiger, then the son will also be a tiger.*

Some lessons can only be transferred through experience. This is the foundation upon which this technique is built. In its base form, it’s just a typical technique consisting of slaying one’s opponents and absorbing their prowess, however, as just that, it always seemed imperfect, limited even when compared to techniques of similar type.

It’s only when combined with the Qiang Bloodline in its true form, that the true potential of this technique is revealed. The proper method to employing this technique relies on challenging the spirit of your ancestors to combat. Because of the close bond you share, the rate of absorption is much higher than it would otherwise be. With the royal bloodline, the life energy required to summon the spirits is much lower than what one gains from defeating them. And since when defeated spirits dissipate, they return to the underworld from whence they can be resummoned, the same challenge can be repeated in the future.

The technique is not without risk. To gain greater benefits, one must face more difficult ancestral challenges. In the fight, multiple ancestral spirits, can be faced at once, but the practitioner of this technique must face them alone, the only exception being their life-bonded treasures. And each challenge must end with either the destruction of the spirits, or the death of the challenger. No quarter will be given. Only in combat to the death, where nothing is held back, can the true connection be formed.

The rewards make up for the risks. Great leaps in cultivation can be achieved if one can face difficult enough of a challenge. Not only does the practitioner gain true combat experience, but they can also gain physical attributes that were hallmarks of the challenged ancestors. What’s more, challenging an ancestor, makes your bond with him grow stronger, which results in it being easier to summon him to fight by your side. And most importantly, even if one were to fall, as long as his lineage continues and this technique is passed down, he can be sure that in the future, he can continue to help make the Qiang prosper, this time as the one being challenged.

//Inspired by the example Ancestral Slaughter Method. Summon avatars of your ancestors, challenge them, and through slaying them, absorb life energy needed to cultivate your body, enhance the bond with your bloodline, and gain physical attributes that they possessed. Another technique that got elevated by the bond with spearfu, since the full prowess of it relies on summoning ancestor spirits.


###Offensive Techniques
####“Besiegement of the Soul Fortress” – Attack - Grade 10
*In arms even it is best to attack hearts rather than cities; to fight with sentiment is better than to fight with weapons.*

In the world of cultivation, it is well known that one need not lash at their enemies in the physical world to wound them. However, there are ways to translate tactics used in physical battles into the realm of souls, this technique is one of them.

By summoning his ancestors not in the physical world, but inside his Soul Palace, Qiang Wei, can then use them to assault the enemy’s soul directly. After connecting his mind sea to that of an enemy, he can use that connection as a channel to send the spirits with an order to attack the enemy’s soul. Damage caused by such an assault can weaken the enemy, so that Qiang Wei can finish him off physically, or in case of a large disparity in the strength of their souls, even kill the enemy outright if their soul is destroyed.

//Soul based attack, summon spirits of your ancestors to attack your enemy, by sending them to assault their mind sea. Based on the initial idea I had for Soul Spirits against enemies. In essence, it’s an upgraded/fluffed version of the ability described at Soul Master rank (3) of the soul cultivation.


####“Ten Thousand Strikes of Ten Thousand Immortals” – Barrage - Grade 10++
*If he is taking his ease, give him no rest. If his forces are united, separate them.*

Rather than on power, this defensive spear style, favourite of Qiang Wei, puts emphasis on speed and variety of strike angles. It drowns the enemy in an endless barrage of thrusts from unexpected directions, while trying to avoid overextensions that the opponent might use. The goal is to exhaust the target until the damage from accumulated wounds brings him down, or an opening for a finishing blow is exposed. Qiang Wei practiced this style since he barely learned how to walk, and there might not exist another person of his age, who couldmatch him in it. 

//Spear based, body technique, the default attack type for the character. A defensive fighting style aimed at not letting the enemy rest with an endless barrage of thrusts from a variety of angles, with a goal of “death by a thousand cuts” or creating an opening for more powerful techniques.

####“Fate Dawns on the Doomed” – Ambush - Grade 11
*Nothing could resist the Jade Tipped Spear. Armor, clothing, she went through without effort and blood gushed forth in fountains wherever she struck.*

Traversing roads unknown to mere mortals, the Jade Tipped Spear seeks her target. Like Fate, there are few who can avoid this strike. No barrier can block her path, for with this technique the Spear doesn’t move in the physical world. She can’t be outrun, for to her, a li is but a step. Endure, perish, or prove that even Fate can’t reach you.

//A spear thrust that bypasses almost all kinds of defences with a combination of phasing and teleporting. Barrier/armour/block? Phase through it. Dodge? Teleport to strike the new position. Possible to counter if you have an overwhelming speed advantage where you can set up new defences/dodges in the last moment before the strike connects, leaving too little time for the spear to start phasing/teleporting. Or if you are tough enough to just handle the damage, cause in the end it’s pretty much just Attack tier damage.

###Defensive Techniques
####“Visage of an Invincible Conqueror” – Endurance - Grade 10++
*Victorious warriors win first and then go to war.*

Believe in your invincibility, visualize it, and display this image, and when even your enemies believe it, the world itself might just start too. The aura exuded by the user of this technique, gives him an air as if nobody can defeat him. As long as he trusts in that, grievously damaging him will prove more difficult. With the Spear in hand, Qiang Wei’s stance is the image of unassailability.

This technique’s effectiveness depends on the state the user is in. To overcome this technique, two illusions must be proven false. First: that the user can’t be harmed; because of that, the first blows that reach him might just slide off. Second: that the user can’t be defeated; because of that, the blows that should finish him off, might still leave him standing, if barely.

//Soul based technique that for Qiang Wei works best with a spear. It projects an image of indestructibility so real, that the world itself decides it should be so, and the damage the user would receive is lessened as it’s deemed outside its plans. Works best when the user is either completely unharmed, or when he is on the very brink of defeat. Those effects overlap, so the absolute highest reduction is against one-shot attacks, though still it’s just a reduction and can be overcome, of course.


####“One Spear, One Thousand Arms of Protection” – Barrier - Grade 11
*And he is skilful in defence whose opponent does not know what to attack*

With his spear and skill alone, the user of this technique can take a defensive stance in which he’s protected as if by the thousand arms of a Boddhisatva. By focusing on defending himself, he can parry any attack coming his way. One Spear acts like a thousand and can block even simultaneous attacks from multiple directions. When wielded by a master of this technique, even esoteric attacks, that shouldn’t be physical, can be struck out of the air.

//A defensive body-based spear technique, where by taking an appropriate stance and focusing on defence, almost any attack can be parried, to the point where it acts as a barrier and is able to block strikes even when one thinks it shouldn’t be able to, like physically blocking more esoteric techniques, or stopping strikes from multiple angles at the same time.

####“Retribution of Jade Heavens” – Reversal - Grade 11
*Invincibility lies in the defence; the possibility of victory in the attack.*

He who lashes against the heavens, will be struck down without mercy. This technique is a form of counterattack directed at those who insult the majesty of the Jade Princess. The more powerful the affronting strike, the more punishing the retribution for it will be.

While using this technique, the gates of the Forbidden Hall open for but the briefest moment. Bathed in their golden light, the Spear’s mastery over space gets temporarily elevated, the power shared with her proportional to that of the strike targeted at her and her chosen companion. In this state, the Spear can pierce right through the incoming attack and into the offender, putting an end to both, as the space itself caves in recognizing her authority.

Besides the circumstances, this technique requires vast amounts of Life Energy to use, for the difficult part of it isn’t actually elevating the Spear’s power, but controlling it. Almost as if, the power was always rightfully hers. It’s on Qiang Wei and his skills to tame and direct it. It’s not an easy task, especially because, due to its nature, it requires activation in but a fraction of a second. He needs to be careful when and how often to employ it, but in return, this technique can counter almost any attack and strike back with terrifying power.

//Body based spear technique. Overdrive of the spear inscription for one counterattack. Overcharging the spearfu's space ripping ability lets her tear a path through the opponent’s attack, cancelling it, and creating an opening for a counter which is empowered proportionally to the attack countered. Very taxing and difficult to use, but its power is second only to some Trump-Cards.


###Movement Techniques
####“Soaring Dragon’s Elusive Steps” – Footwork - Grade 10
*Quickness is the essence of the war.*

The user of this technique can soar through the sky like a dragon as the space responds to his calls call. His movements fast, precise, and immune to natural limitations. A master of this technique is said to be able to change his position without taking any visible steps. At its peak, even the path to the target is unneeded, arrival at his destination as instant as if he has always been there.

//Soul based, space manipulation movement. Slightly Dragon themed, since spears are apparently often associated with that. Its main point is three-dimensional movement and directional changes that are very difficult to predict as it's more of a space bending around the user than him having to take physical actions to move. At higher realms, includes teleporting. Without spearfu’s space magic elevating it, the technique was still focused on hiding one’s intentions when and where to move and allowed to fly, but nowhere near the level it is at now, and no teleporting, so it was about grade 5 at most.
