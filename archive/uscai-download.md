### Installing The Script
- Install a userscript manager such as violentmonkey, tampermonkey, firemonkey, etc on your browser. (violentmonkey recommended)
- Create a new script and paste the contents of the paste bin. Save. If you have the .js file, paste its contents.
OR
- Install the script by dragging the .js file into your browser window.
- When using CAI, click on your userscript manager and you should see CAI-Downloader is activated.

### How To Download Your Chats
- Recommended way is to enter a chat with your character, click the three dot dropdown and select "View Saved Chats".
	1. Here you can either click the download button below each chat to download it.
	2. Or, you can click the **▼ button** in the top right to download the entire chat history.
- If this doesn't work OR you're trying to archive a Room chat, simply click the **⬇ button** in the top right, while in the desired chat.
	- Note that this is more likely to break in the future and may have formatting errors.
	- This will auto scroll your chat to the top to download all of it, but is frequently buggy. 
- If all else fails, press alt-5.
	- This requires you to scroll manually until all the chats you want have been loaded. (Can hold page up to scroll)
