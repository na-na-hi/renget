A-chan opened the door to Moona’s apartment and arrived at a scene of modern decadence. Moona was seated at her dining table in a world of her own; one hand held a triple cheeseburger the size of a dinner plate, the other hefted a soft drink that must have been over a thousand calories. Crowding her elbows were oily bags of fry crumbs and a landfill of crumpled burger wrappers, all bespeckled with ketchup and mustard and any other condiment that didn’t make it to her mouth. She was midbite when A-chan loudly cleared her throat and announced her presence.

“Good afternoon, Moona!” A-chan’s gaze roved across the devastation on Moona’s table, noting that not even their recent company potluck had produced so much refuse.  “Wow, that’s a pretty big meal! Did you skip breakfast today?”

Moona swallowed her mouthful of burger and chased with a long sip of soda. She looked at the sandwich in her hand then shrugged her shoulders. “Hm? No. This is normal for lunch. If you want some, I can order more, though.”

“Maybe next time. I’m just here to drop off Kronii.” A-chan reached into her briefcase to retrieve the recently miniaturized Kronii and set her on the table. Guilt clutched A-chan’s chest as she watched Kronii’s tiny body wade through the fast food clutter like a frightened mouse. A-chan hadn’t been entirely honest when convincing Kronii to drink Koyori’s proprietary shrinking potion, claiming that her only responsibilities would be massaging Moona’s hands or cleaning her keyboard. But they didn’t have much of a choice since no one else would have volunteered. Only Ollie– the resident super pervert –would have answered the call but she was tied up with servicing Bae for the foreseeable future.

“Well, that’s it from me. I’ll be back later to pick you up, Kronii.” A-chan turned around and sped out the door before she could have any second thoughts.

Kronii looked around the table (larger than a tennis court relative to her shrunken form) and shoved away the wrappers brushing at her shoulders. She maintained a polite smile that slowly wavered as she watched Moona gorge herself on *another* greasy, super-sized burger. Kronii had heard tales of Moona’s incredible metabolism, but there’s no way her body could maintain its figure eating like that all the time…right?

“Wow! Kronii, you’re so small now!” Moona chuckled and paused her meal to get a closer look. Her great yellow eyes, shing like twin moons, peered down with an ominous pressure, and Kronii suddenly became very aware of how massive her co-worker was. “Good to see you again!”

“Yeah, man, it’s good to see you, too. I’m still not 100% sure what I’m supposed to be doing but…let’s have fun today, I guess?”

“Of course! I think it’s gonna-” A sudden, raucous belch blew past Moona’s lips, nearly lifting Kronii off her feet. “Sorry. I've been like that all day. Anyway, I’m sure today will be great. Let me finish eating first and we can get started.”

Kronii watched the rest of Moona’s meal with quiet awe. Moona’s body was famously stacked, a perfect hourglass with measurements most supermodels would spend thousands of hours and thousands of dollars chasing, but these days it seemed her bodaciousness had reached new heights. Those 65cm tits were bigger, heavier, and sagged lower on her body, retaining a healthy jiggle when she leaned in for another bite. Her waist was still proportional narrow, but had a good amount more fat packed on, especially around the belly that was currently plump and bloated from her self-described “normal” dinner.

And if all of that was buffed up, Kronii thought, eyes trailing down Moona’s body, then that could only mean her enormous ass is even-

Moona suddenly scarfed down the rest of her burger, then chugged the full 16 ounce soda with barely any time to chew. Her stomach disagreed with that hasty decision and growled irritability, churning her meal with all the noisy telltale signs of incoming troubled digestion. Another burp was forced from Moona’s throat as she leaned back and patted her stomach.

“…you good?” Kronii asked.

The faintest hint of discomfort crossed Moona’s face, but it left just as quickly. “Um, yeah, I’m good. Are you ready?” Not waiting for a response, Moona simply scooped Kronii up into her hand and set off deeper into her apartment.

Kronii swung and bobbed around in Moona’s clutches as the walls and furnishings of the apartment blurred past. “H-hey, wait! Where are we going?” she asked, concerning growing in her voice.

Moona turned the corner, now nearly jogging, and dashed inside the room to her right. She flicked on the lights and slammed the door shut.

When Kronii’s head stopped spinning, she realized where they were: Moona’s bathroom. Nothing out of the ordinary, save for a subtle unpleasant stink teasing her nose. Moona dropped Kronii off on the sink’s counter and fumbled with her belt. There was clear desperation in her movements, something Kronii found ominous.

“I’m meeting some of the girls later today for karaoke,” Moona explained, already unbuckling her jeans and yanking them down past her extra wide hips. “I just make a quick stop here and then we can go.” With her pants and underwear down to her knees, Moona abruptly turned around and slammed her fat ass down on the toilet, impressive buttcheeks spilling over the edges of the seat like pudding. From a high enough angle, you couldn’t even see the toilet under all of Moona’s butt meat.

Before Kronii could voice her (very reasonable) concerns, Moona’s hand shot out and snatched  Kronii from the counter. Moona brought her down to rest atop her bare thigh like she was nothing more than a cell phone she brought to the bathroom to kill time. “Just want to make sure you don’t fall or anything,” Moon said nonchalantly. “…I might be here for a while.”

For a few anxious seconds, nothing happened. Then a low, bubbly gurgle squeezed through Moona’s stomach and she shifted her hips expectantly. Kronii bucked and squirmed within Moona’s grasp but she might as well have been trying to wriggle free from a cave-in.

“What’s going on? Moona?!” Kronii’s eyes were wide and desperate. The last thirty seconds had been too absurd to properly rationalize.

Moona simply straightened her back and bit her bottom lip. Half a second later, Moona’s asshole fired off a loud, sloppy cacophony of beefy farts that echoed powerfully inside the toilet bowl. Kronii didn’t need to see or smell what Moona was unleashing upon her poor toilet, she could *feel* the rumbling blasts shake Moona’s hips, travel down her thighs, and jostle the warden’s entire minuscule body. Fortunately, Moona’s fat thighs were still pressed tightly together and kept the horrid winds swirling below mercifully sealed. Moona gently leaned to one side and let out an absolutely disgusting ripper, the shameless act accentuated by the obscene sound of her sweaty ass cheeks clapping together, then sighed and wiggled back into her seat. Never in her years at Hololive had Kronii seen such a vulgar display!

And yet, Moona herself was entirely unperturbed. Aside from the occasional twitch of her lips, Moona’s face remained shockingly deadpan and unbothered, as if her caked-up bubble butt hadn’t just unloaded the most repulsive series of greasy, toilet-shaking farts in the country.

“Ugh, sorry, I haven’t had a bathroom breaks in like…three days,” Moona said, idly rubbing her stomach with her free hand. Preparations for upcoming concerts and collabs had kept her glued to her desk for most of the day and the stress made it hard to have a “productive” idol meeting. In the back of her mind, Moona hoped she wouldn’t have to phone up another plumber when this was all over…

Three minutes of mercilessly gassing out her toilet soon passed and Moona was sweating up a storm. With an annoyed grunt, she pulled her damp, smelly shirt over her heavy M-cup breasts and carelessly tossed it to the tile by the bathtub, leaving her in only the dark jeans pooled around her ankles and a fancy black lace bra struggling to support her enormous jiggling tits. Leaning forward, Moona narrowed her eyes and pressed her lips together. A loud, bassy shart resounded in the bowl and cratered the pool of water from the sheer force of her gas. The seat vibrated dully as Moona’s fart rapidly petered out into a wet, high-pitched squeak. She slumped her shoulders and let out a relieved sigh when it was done and, for the first time since sitting down, opened her thighs.

The previously quarantined stench rushed out from between her thighs and into the open air, billowing past Kronii’s bewildered face. The air Kronii sucked down was nothing less than *rancid*; the combined aroma of dozens of warm fermented farts instantly filled Kronii’s nostrils with the beefy, cheesy stench of Moona’s slobbish dinner binge, sending her into a coughing, wheezing fit. She could barely function with so much putrid shitstink clogging her sinuses and polluting the air. For a brief moment, as tears wobbled in her eyes, she wondered if throwing herself lethally to the floor would be preferable to taking another breath.

“Ah. They smell kinda bad today,” Moona remarked, lazily waving her hand in front of her face. This wasn’t the *worst* bathroom blowout she’d had…but it was a close second.

“P-please let me go,” Kronii pleaded weakly from the top of Moona’s thigh, seemingly on the precipice of death just from a few whiffs of Moona’s gas.

“Sure, we’ll leave soon. I’m almost…*ahh*...done.” Another fart blared out and added to Kroni’s misery. 

Based on how wet the last couple of farts were, Moona could sense she was close. Moona clenched her fists and flexed her asshole, hoping to finally work past the massive blockage that had been cramping her stomach for over 72 hours. A soft hissing and crackling followed as she strained atop the toilet, sweat streaking down her body. Following another vulgar series of bassy farts, her sweaty asshole gaped and started pushing out a long, dark brown rope of heavily compacted shit, nearly as thick as her wrist. Moona grunted, pearls of sweat racing down her face and neck as she struggled to drop the first of *many* oversized loads into her helpless toilet.

“*Nnngghh…!”* Moona let out a huge breath as the first solid log slid free of her spluttering asshole and plopped heavily into the toilet, the splashback rudely speckling the bottom of her plump thighs. Before she could catch her breath, Moona’s stomach gurgled viciously and another fat pillar of shit barreled out of her slick, musky asshole, breaking apart into two massive chunks on the way out. At least this one was easier to pass. It slammed down on top of her first load, the sound of its impact dampened somewhat. She smiled, suddenly feeling at least two pounds lighter, then lifted one asscheek and fired off several wet, rumbling farts back to back, painting the bowl with light brown splatters.

Breathing heavily, Moona then snatched one of the hand towels from the sink counter to mat down her neck and intensely sweaty armpits that were busy dripping down her torso. These kinds of idol meetings were always such a workout, and if the stench of her farts and shit didn’t fully envelope the bathroom, her ensuing body odor would finish the job.

Kronii, meanwhile, was in a waking nightmare. The wave of humid stench drifting off Moona’s fresh shit felt like a solid wall when it smacked across her face. It spread up and out, and filled the room like a space heater. The bathroom mirror fogged. The air grew thick and muggy. Even the walls seemed to sweat with condensation as the humidity ramped up. Kronii could barely breathe without choking on the stench of Moona’s shit. All she could manage was a few pathetic smacks upon Moona’s thigh. 

Moona responded to her friend’s dire plight with a sharp grunt and another heavy reeking load splashing into the bowl. The solid blockage had now mostly loosened up and Moona was free to really let loose. Lifting slightly on her tiptoes, she firmly massaged her stomach and flexed her abs. A pale brown torrent of messy, semi-liquid shit splattered onto the previous pile of Moona’s steaming dump, spilling down the sides and rapidly filling up the remainder of the crowded bowl. A slew of especially rancid-smelling farts occasionally broke up the long streaming ropes of shit and made for a truly disgusting finale. There was no longer any visible water in the bowl; just a fat mountain of Moona’s toilet-clogging dump. 

At the twenty minute mark, after many more asshole-gaping, bowl-shaking shits, Moona’s stomach finally settled down. Moona dropped her tense shoulders and swiped her sweaty bangs from over her eyes. For a while there, she was genuinely worried she’d end up going over capacity. 

Moona placed the dazed Kronii back on the counter. Getting up to a half squat, Moona reached for the toilet paper and pulled off three, four…seven squares, before folding them up and digging inside her stinking, sweltering canyon of an asscrack. She dug around for a long time in there, knowing how difficult it was to reach everything, then pulled back and tossed the well-used wad atop her imposing mound of shit. She repeated with another huge handful of toilet paper, not bothering to fold it this time and just shoving it in there. Her legs were falling asleep after the sixth rotation, but she now felt confident that she was clean. Though it was always hard to know for sure.

Moona gently poked Kronii with her finger. “Hey. I think I got everything but can you check it over?”

“Huh?” Kronii was still recovering from her shock and couldn’t register the request. “N-no, I couldn’t possibly…”

Moona plucked Kronii from the counter and brought her around to her recently wiped backside. Considering Moona just spent the better part of an hour destroying her toilet, the stench buried between her fat asscheeks was uniquely awful. Kronii’s nose was already burning.

“So yeah, like I said earlier, I have a meetings with some of the other girls. But the thing is…” Moona searched for the right words “I guess my farts are really bad or something? The staff said I had to do something about it before coming over, so I can just have you take care of it, right?”

Kronii looked like someone had just ordered her execution. “That’s crazy! I won’t-!”

Using one hand to peel back her massive cheek, Moona dug in with the other and mashed Kronii’s poor face deep into her (mostly) wiped asshole. 

Moona’s swamp ass was truly horrendous. Fresh off the porcelain throne she finished blowing up, the thick residual scents clung stubbornly to her thick ring of lavender anal hair and slowly ground into Kronii’s face. While Kronii was eternally thankful that at least Moona had the presence of mind to wipe extra diligently after that apocalyptic dump, there was still so much built up grime and ass sweat assaulting her lips and nostrils. Her arms were pinned, her body was buried between mountains of sweaty ass flesh, and, worst of all, half her face was swallowed by Moona’s musky anal wrinkles.

“Yeah. So, just stay like that for now, I guess?” Moona gave her figure a quick once over in the bathroom mirror, noting that Kronii’s entire body was completely and hopeless enveloped between her fat fucking cheeks. Not even a strand of blue hair or errant limb gave away her vile imprisonment. “I’ll take you out after.”

Moona finished pulling up her panties (they were quickly swallowed by her ass and flossed into Kronii’s back, firmly securing her role as Moona’s fart filter for the rest of the day), then squeezed her shelf of an ass into her jeans. There were a few rips from the seams relenting to Moona’s girth, and more than a few muffled screams from Kronii’s tiny mouth, but everything settled down eventually.

Now there was the matter of flushing. Crossing her fingers, Moona bent down and pressed down on the toilet’s handle. Instead of the surging flow of fresh water, she got nothing but the choking gurgle of the toilet trying to flush something well past its ability. Truthfully, all of HoloID working together wouldn’t have been able to match Moona’s massive dump that day.

Moona rapidly jiggled the handle, muttered something in Indonesian, and swiftly gave up with an annoyed kick to the base of the toilet. “Ah, fine, fine. We need a plumbers again, I guess.” Moona swung open the bathroom door and headed for the living room, allowing the thick miasma to seep out and stain the hallway. 

As Moona shrugged on her coat and adjusted her glasses, she needed to confirm one last thing before meeting up with the others. Lifting one leg, Moona’s asshole pushed out against Kronii’s pitiful face and unloaded a wet, blubbery, seven-second rumbler into her skintight jeans. Moona’s face didn’t move a muscle as she flexed her abs and finished off the horrific expulsion of post-dump flatulence with a nauseatingly wet brap that bordered dangerously close to a shart. Nervously, she patted down the seat of her jeans and was relieved to find that she was in the clear…though it was *intensely* warm and much more damp than she would have liked.

Next, Moona sniffed the space around her. Perfect. Aside from the latent musk still pouring from her bathroom like an irradiated biohazard, the air was free of the usual plant-wilting, nose-searing death cloud her ass was prone to produce. Moona found it almost unbelievable; after all, how could something as small as Kronii soak up all that stench?

On cue, Kronii’s desperate screams climbed to a record high after being blasted point blank with a fart that vile, especially since the gas had nowhere to go but down her throat. Nonchalantly, Moona clenched her massive cheeks and planted her heavy ass on the counter, adding some extra weight while she unloaded another sloppy, five-second fart, bringing a swift end to Kronii’s complaining. Satisfied, Moona stepped outside.

Her phone buzzed with a short inquiry from Pekora on behalf of the other girls.

`Hey Moona! We’re ordering spicy dumplings for the meeting! Have you eaten yet?`

Moona stopped and considered the offer, rubbing her stomach. Spicy dumplings gave her the *worst* gas but, then again, she had a personal fart sponge now. Plus she hadn’t eaten in a while. Her thumbs danced across the screen.

`Make it a triple serving!`
