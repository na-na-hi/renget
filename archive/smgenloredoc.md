"***Wait - what? This game has lore!?***" - You *(the newfag reader)*, just now
"***who gives a fuck about the lore?***" - You *(the experienced player skimming over this doc to make sure I'm not feeding bullshit to newer players)*, just now

   Yes, ...SMITE!!! has lore and an ongoing narrative, and it would be amiss of me to not make a true introductory doc - both for Lore and World Mythology in general.
   But note - the Lore has next to no impact on the game itself - it's just a thing on the side that might amuse you for a while, with some parts that are better written than others. ***Don't take it too seriously.*** Now re-read the previous sentence.
***If you don't care, the 'lore' is basically all fluff, and you can safely skip on it.*** The only thing it affects are the 'story' events and the aesthetics of the maps *(with almost no lore-related skins whatsoever, and skin releases usually being irrelevant to the topic of the 'event' they drop in)*. I'm almost certain that this has almost no bearing on any new God releases either.

-> However, there's a good chance that mythology and cross-Pantheon interactions were one of the appealing factors that brought you towards playing this game... in which case, *I can only hope you enjoy your time reading*. <-

 -> **HEADS UP: There's a lot of embedded images throughout the docs, for lack of an alternative method.** <-
 -> **For the most part, I've compressed them as well as I could to save on loading times without losing (any) quality; but if you've still got limited internet in the current year, pause the loading once you can see text. If there was a more lightweight way for me to do it, while keeping it inline and high quality within a doc like this, I'd do it - but as is, it's the best I can work with (short of making and hosting a dedicated site for it).** <-
 -> *If you don't know what that means, basically every image has to load in full at once, instead of just the stuff your screen displays. Takes a while to load fully when you've got as much stuff gathered as I have for you, and chews through limited data allowances. It's also why the doc is split up into multiple pages, just to save on loading times.* <-
 -> *\*Update: If some images are died, blame catbox, I've fixed all the ones I could find.* <-

 -> *Also, if the white light is blinding your \*delicate\* eyes, Rentry has a night-mode you can turn on by scrolling to the bottom of the page and clicking on the Sun icon in the bottom-right corner. Don't worry, the docs are made with it in mind in terms of transparent images - just try not to spoil yourself while down there.* <-

### Introductory Notes (Skip)

https://rentry.co/smgenlorepreface
This Doc covers the following arcs:
 - Foreword (Skippable)
 - What is and is not canon? (Skippable)
 - General Setting / Da Rulez (Skippable)

*Honestly. it's mostly just here for posterity, I'd unironically advise you don't read, unless you really care about the writing process.*
*tl;dr I've put real effort in, hope you like it, my name is Anon Faggotson, age XX, I write like a faggot, you might want to zoom your page out to ~70-80% so you can see full images clearer.*

###   -> ~ = ~ = ~ = ~ = ~ = ~ = ~ = ~ = ~ = ~ <-

###Actual Mythology (>3,500BC to 2012) + The Gallery

https://rentry.co/smgenloreclassics

   *Huge doc - will probably take longer to read than the lore. BUT if it wasn't important, I wouldn't have made it.*

   **Completely skippable if you've DYOR**, this doc covers the fundamental concepts behind each Pantheon and a small amount on their history. Nothing to do with the actual SMITE lore, just covers all the Pantheons in a tl;dr format if you weren't read up on all of them.
   *After all, if you're European, I wouldn't expect you to know the Mayan Pantheon in detail; if you're Central / South American, I wouldn't expect you to know that much about the Chinese Pantheon; if you're Asian, how could I expect you to know much about the Celtic Pantheon ~~and if you're North American, I wouldn't expect you to know anything~~. So on / so forth.*
  The Galleries are there to lure you in anyways if you have DYOR - various collections of the highest quality God Splash Art, along with all their promotional material and relevant concept art; split by each Pantheon. Most of it is 4k and there's stuff I can assure you, you won't find with ease otherwise.

###Asides (Skippable)

These are all meant to be read alongside the lore itself as additional mythology / context, and are linked throughout the above anyways when it's best to read them - telling you about various, mildly interesting topics, or *things that make you go....hmm....*
Just linking them all here so there's a central place to access them if you miss one.
