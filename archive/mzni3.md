aubrey touch sunny pp

>Aubrey wakes up to the light of the morning sun coming through the window. She’d slept in Sunny’s bed with him again, comforting him after another nightmare
>She has one hand on his chest, and she feels it rise and fall as he sleeps soundly
>Then Aubrey’s eyes trail further down, meeting the tent in Sunny’s pants
>She’s seen his morning wood before, it was kind of an inevitability since they sleep together so often, but it’s not something either of them have ever brought attention to
>She doesn’t know why, but she finds herself wondering what it looks like without anything covering it
>She decides to rationalize the thought as simple curiosity—she’s never been so close to a boy before, so she's just curious
>At that moment, Aubrey is also inexplicably struck by the urge to touch it
>She wonders: would Sunny be okay with it? They’ve literally cried to sleep in each other’s arms before, sure, but this feels like a whole new level of intimacy, somehow
>Maybe he wouldn’t notice, he was fast asleep anyway, and she just wanted to know what it felt like…
>As slowly and gingerly as she can, Aubrey moves the hand that was on Sunny chest toward his lower half
>Suddenly, she has second thoughts. What if Sunny does feel it? He’s gonna think she’s just taking advantage of him… he’s gonna hate her… he’s not gonna wanna be around her anymore…
>Just as she’s about to pull her hand away, she looks at Sunny’s face
>His eyes are open, and he’s looking right at her

>"G'morning, Sunny..." she says casually in a desperate attempt to play off the situation
>"...Morning..." he whispers back
>Aubrey then realizes her hand is still hovering near his dick, and she draws it back like she's been burned
>"I was just... I wanted-- I mean, I didn't, um..."
>Fuck fuck fuck he's gonna hate her he's gonna leave her why did she think this was a good idea--
>"It's fine"
>"Hm?" He spoke so quietly, Aubrey thinks she misheard him at first
>"What you were doing. It's... it's fine..."
>Did that... mean what she thought it meant? Aubrey is pretty sure she knows what he means, but she's terrified of getting this wrong. She looks at his face
>Sunny is blushing. His eyes meet hers for a moment before darting away
>Aubrey hesitantly brings her hand back to his crotch, stopping right in front of it. She looks at Sunny one more time to make sure this was really okay. He gives her the slightest of nods
>She places her hand on his erection. It feels hard, even through his pants
>Aubrey moves her hand a bit, caressing it slightly, and Sunny whimpers. She looks at his face again. He's blushing furiously, his eyes transfixed on Aubrey's hand
>Emboldened by Sunny's reaction, Aubrey begins to move her hand some more, still stroking slowly but more deliberately. Sunny squirms and lets out more little whimpers and sighs. Aubrey finds it unbearably cute
>He's so sensitive... he's probably never been touched this way by someone else before. Aubrey wonders if he's even touched himself before, but that feels like it would be an odd question to ask, even considering their current situation, so she doesn't say anything
>Still continuing her movement, Aubrey glances at Sunny's face. His eyes are locked onto Aubrey's moving hand like it's the only thing in the world. He's pulled his shirt over his mouth, presumably to muffle the noises he's making. Aubrey doesn't mind when he makes noises at all, in fact, she wishes he would make more
>She feels it throb in her hand, accompanied by a gasp from Sunny as his hips lift up slightly. Aubrey keeps stroking, a bit faster now. She takes in every detail of this moment, burning it into her brain
>The hardness of Sunny's penis contrasted with the soft feeling of the fabric of his pants, his flushed expression, his heavy breathing, his cute moans and whimpers, the way his toes curl inward, the way the lower half of his body moves in time with her hand...
>She's really making him feel good. The thought makes her heart flutter. She goes a little bit faster
>"Aubrey..." Sunny moans, sounding almost breathless. Oh, she likes that. The way he breathes out her name. She... really really likes that, actually. Aubrey squeezes her legs together as something stirs inside her
>Sunny is clutching the sheets hard now. He's still staring at Aubrey's hand as it moves, but his eyes seem unfocused. He says her name again in that wonderful way, and then...

>Sunny's body goes rigid and he groans. Aubrey watches, mesmerized, as a dark spot blossoms in the fabric of the thin pajama pants he wears to bed. Some white liquid seeps through and gets on her hand, but she doesn't really care. All she can focus on is Sunny, his sounds, his body, the way his load stains his pants, the blissful expression on his face... she takes it all in
>Finally, Sunny stops squirming, and it's over. Aubrey takes her hand off of his softening length. She presses the tips of her fingers together and slowly spreads them apart, watching the thin strands of white between them
>There's a moment of silence between them, then Aubrey comes to her senses
>"Oh, I should probably, um, get you some- some new clothes... and help you clean up..." she stammers, getting off the bed
>As she looks through Sunny's wardrobe for fresh pairs of pants and underwear, her thoughts run a mile a minute in her head
>She couldn't stop thinking about the way Sunny looked... the way he sounded, that wonderful way he had said her name... she desperately wanted to hear that again, to make him feel good again. She rubbed her thighs together slightly
>Eventually, she returns to Sunny's beside with tissues and clean clothes. She turns around while he cleans himself up and changes. Aubrey realizes that it seems kind of silly to bother with privacy after she just finished... "relieving" him, but keeps her back to him anyway
>"Okay," Sunny says, letting her know she can look again. Aubrey turns around. Sunny is holding his stained clothes in a bundle. He walks to the door, and Aubrey follows him instinctively
>After Sunny's dirty clothes are deposited in the hamper in the bathroom, the two of them make their way to the staircase. Sunny grasps Aubrey's hand like he always does when they go down the stairs
>Before they descend, Sunny turns to Aubrey and smiles
>"Thank you, for, um, you- you know..." He looks away and blushes furiously
>"Oh, yeah, sure! It's... it's no big deal..." Aubrey feels her ears turning red
>They're both silent for a few more moments before they descend the stairs together. A warm, pleasant feeling settles in Aubrey's chest
