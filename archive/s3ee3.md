#Dividends Overview
***
Due to popular demand, the ‘Dividends’ section of the Report is back, although it is still very much a work-in-progress and has the same limitations as in the old report: due to low number of net worth measurements (two), it is very susceptible to price fluctuations, and since it only takes into account the last dividends, it will favor oshicoiners of the top coin(s) over people with wallets that are better diversified for week-by-week stable dividend income.
This section is meant to represent the long-term investment quality, represented by wallet composition. ‘Last Dividends’ displays the last dividends payout, ‘Average Net Worth’ is the average of the leaderboard net worth at the beginning of the data collection period and at its end, and ‘Approximate ROI %’ is ‘Last Dividends’ divided by ‘Average Net Worth’. The data is sorted from highest ‘Approximate ROI %’ to lowest. Since it is just an approximation and concerns a single payout, you should aim for being consistently high rather than always being on the top.
