#### Graphics Classes
>*“A language that doesn’t change the way you think isn’t worth learning.”* —Traditional

*"Chapter 12 gave an idea of what we could do in terms of graphics using a set of simple interface classes, and how we can do it. This chapter presents many of the classes offered. The focus here is on the design, use, and implementation of individual interface classes such as Point, Color, Polygon, and Open_polyline and their uses. The following chapter will present ideas for designing sets of related classes and will also present more implementation techniques."*
