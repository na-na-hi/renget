its pretty self explanatory:
- make sure you're connected to a T4 GPU in the top right, 
- click play on the play button that appears when you mouse over the code in Start TextGenWebUI

if you're having issues post a screenshot on /g/ or just refresh and reconnect to a GPU and click play again and have some fucking patience idk
if it all works you should eventually see this

that's the connection endpoint
follow the instructions at https://rentry.org/freellamas
if you want to turn off logs, delete --verbose here
