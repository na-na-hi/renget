 -> *{Probably the hardest name in the entire game (so far / just ahead of Isis) to be historically accurate with, hits the middle of Tia (like 'Tier') and Tia (as in Croatia), ending with a near-silent but still audiable T. Best described as saying 'TShiearMah.T'. Acceptably given as Tee-A-Mat. ~~Fuck Babylonian, all my niggers hate trying to speak Babylonian~~}* <-

 -> *{To just get straight to the point, it's Gilgameš; of which the š is a -sh with an emphasis on the -'s'h half of -sh, instead of the usual 'h-dominated' -shh. You can sound it out as Gill-ga-mesh and everyone will know exactly who you're talking about, but for ideal accuracy, put a little bit more emphasis on the 's'. ~~Fuck Babylonian, all my niggers hate trying to speak Babylonian~~}* <-
