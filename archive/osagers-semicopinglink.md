-> Copinglink definition on Tumblr by Who-Is-Page <-
 
-> " A non-human identity (or in some cases, relation) which is consciously created. The creator is able to change and pick who/what they identify as/with as need dictates. This identity can be created by anyone, and thus, is not dictated by one's mental health. / A consciously created coping mechanism which centers around knowingly, willingly, and actively identifying as (or in some cases, with) the user's choice of a non-human entity. / (2017) A (fictitious) human identity which is taken on as consciously created coping mechanism. " <-

-> There's obviously more to this definition, but this is for a general idea. (Do research into it on your own if you're curious)
The thing is, though, that me being a Fan Copinglink falls inbetween being voluntary (aka the "link" in "copinglink") and involuntary (like terms that use " kin", like "fictionkin") (though the voluntary-ness of fictionkins seems to be up to debate) (?) (I'm not quite sure). For me, it started as finding Fan relatable, which soon lead to me identifying AS him (not *with* him). It is voluntary as in I am aware that I am not *actually* him, but involuntary in the sense that I am **incapable of detaching myself from him**.
Because I am "linked" to him as a coping mechanism for my neurodivergence etc, I consider myself a copinglink. However, due to the fact that, despite consciously identifying as him (to an extent; my brain confuses me), I have latched onto that identity and **cannot** separate that from my identity, I consider myself a *semi-conscious copinglink* or a *semi-voluntary copinglink*, shortened to a **semi-copinglink**.
These are not official terms, nor am I coining them in any way. This is just how I identify my situation ^\_^ <-

-> Please keep this in mind, however. Due to the flexibility of my identity, how I refer to Fan will vary and how I refer to myself will vary, but **do not invalidate me**. I wouldn't call what I'm experiencing a "fun" situation (in most ways, it actually hurts me), but I am near incapable of changing that. <-

-> **TL;DR : My connection to Fan was voluntary at first, but because involuntary overtime. My connection is also complicated and has infrequencies. And it sucks. :( ** <-
