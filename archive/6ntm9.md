Skadeglad
"Skadeglad is an old little map that's been begging me to get finished. It doesn't look very fancy, but some thought's been put into gameplay. The concept with this was dual: To have a small playing field that changes shape and form as one makes progress through the map, and to have low level monsters pose a large threat through strategic placement. It's meant to be very hard, but not in an unfair way."

"Timeline 0: JOBHOLDER - THE DEATH OF ARCHIE
This timeline is played second by the player but chronologically happens first. In this part of the story the player assumes the role of the Debianfriend, who progressively sees his friend Archie ruin himself as a human being by turning his mind off to everything that isn't arch and anime. Watch as this sadness and tragedy is manifested through glorious psycho-existential objects to push a feeling through to you. As this timeline progresses the player switches over to Archie once again and things get more abstract and psychotic until the climax of Archie's "suicide", resulting in an absolutely astounding representation of him passing the existential singularity through a level straight out of a nightmare."

Burl Tumd
The primary emphasis in Burl Tumd is speed: EVERYTHING happens faster. You move faster, you kill faster, and you die faster. Weapons are made to be far more responsive and powerful, and in addition to speed there's a large emphasis on efficiency. Playing intelligently and using the right weapon at the right time will let you tear through the hordes at incredible speeds, whereas rushing in blindly will get you massacred quickly.

Samsara
This is a multiplayer project inspired by crossover fighting games, designed to bring these games that people love so much and give them a second life on the multiplayer front, taking the heroes and the weapons and pitting them all aside (and sometimes against) each other. When you play Samsara, you pick a hero from a classic FPS game, spawn in the battlefield with abilities and weapons from their original game, and then proceed to lay waste among all those that stand in your way in whatever iwad or levelset of your choice. Each of the heroes are strictly limited to their own weapons, so you won't have a nonsensical random mash-up of people wielding weapons just not suited for them.

Cyberrunner (RIP in Pieces)
Cyberrunner is a post-cyberpunk battle racer with only a few simple goals: Go fast, blow up whatever's in your way, go faster. Player movement is dramatically enhanced, with large leaps and a running speed that's almost double the normal Doomguy speed. In addition, players have a wide variety of parkour techniques at their disposal to go through the air with enough grace to put any YouTube Freerunner to shame, as well as several axis boosts for an extra kick of speed. And in case that's not enough, there's a button to give the Runners an extra turbo boost, dramatically increasing their already-incredible movement.
And now it's dead because Terminus can't into ijoncode.
