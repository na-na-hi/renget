>The next evening arrives with you wandering up and down the block looking for the bowling alley.
>You're not in a great part of the city and GPS is being spotty. 
>You're on your third pass about to call David when you spot a sign at the entrance of a dingy alleyway. 
>"Bowling Behind the Alley" with an arrow pointing down the badly lit path between the buildings.
>Now you understand the name. It's a gimmick. 
>You hope your stalker would swoop in and save you from the impending awkward encounter with Kacia after turning her down but it's too much to ask for.
>David and Kacia are getting shoes fitted while Pam pays for the lanes.
>You greet them and turn your attention to the clerk to get your shoes fitted in a bit to avoid directly interacting with Kacia. 
>She must also want to delay the inevitable awkwardness. "I'll go get some drinks before we start." 
>You, Pam, and David gather at the lanes you've rented.
>Pam and David on one team, you and Kacia on the other.
>"You're going to say yes right?"
"I still don't get it but I trust you as long as you say she wont get hurt." 
"She wont as long as you don't do anything else dumb." 
"Alright, alright." 
"Hey, question though-"
>"Hmm?"
"Is it Brianne?"
>"What about her?" 
"Is she who you said was interested?" 
>David snorts and then laughs. "No way man did you hear anything she was saying yesterday? She's so deep into that 'men's rights' shit she would never!" 
>Pam swats his shoulder. "Hey, she might have some strong opinions but she's still my friend, be nice." 
>"She's plenty nice, I just wish she would talk about anything not political sometimes."
>Pam silently concedes his point.
>A moment later Kacia arrives with a pitcher of beer and a stack of cups. 
>Shes doesn't really directly acknowledge any of you when she sets down the pitcher and divvies out the cups on a table. 
>David says she will ask you out again but you really want to rip off the bandage. 
"Hey Kacia?"
>She finally acknowledges you but looks more at your forehead than at you. 
"I've had a change of heart. If you're still interested in getting coffee I'd love to."
>She swells right away. "Awesome! Sorry I put you on the spot yesterday." 
"No, it's fine. I should have said yes the first time." 
>Pam pulls a ball out of a bag she brought with her.
>If she is bringing her own ball from home you're going to have a challenge.

>It was an insurmountable challenge.
>Pam showed the rest of you up. You even asked her if she plays in a league.
>Apparently she did in college. 
>David was no help to her but she didn't need it to beat you and Kacia. 
>If he managed just to keep the ball out of the gutter he would cheer and Kacia would clap politely. 
>Half way through the night he started getting silly and doing things like facing away from the lane and bowling between his legs.
>It was the only strike he got that night.
>You were just average. 
>Kacia had a bit more grace in throwing the ball which translated into a better score but the two of you still couldn't take down Pam. 
>Kacia went back and forth with you on favorite movies in between bowling. 
>Most of her favorites were documentaries. 
>She went on for a while about a documentary about wolf who liberated a bunch of males during the troubles.
>A lot of her favorites seemed to have a theme to them.
>Rom-coms where a spunky outgoing anthro girl drags an introverted loner outside and rehabilitates him.
>A sci-fi flick about alien lizard girls taking over the world.
>A movie about an anti-hero anthro who saves a bunch of men from human trafficking ("She's literally me!") 
>Plenty of movies still have claiming as a minor theme but in nearly all of her favorites it was a major theme if not a central point. 
>Of course you would know. You've seen all of them. 
>You agree with her on the quality of her favorites but try to hedge your level of love for them.
>You don't want to come off as a weirdo.
>As the end of the evening approaches the two of you are so engrossed in conversation that Pam has to remind either of you to take your turn a few times.
>Eventually your time on the lanes have run out and you start saying your good byes 
>Pam takes her win well.
>David is smug and takes another playful batting from him and a reminder that he didn't help at all. 
>Kacia was just glad to be there and is looking forward to seeing you again after exchanging contact info.
>You enjoyed the night with her but feel conflicted.
>It's not like your relationship with her is going to develop.
>You hit the head while the other three are turning their shoes in.
>When you come back out Kacia is waiting for you.
>She points towards a small alcove with a few arcade games squeezed inside. "Hey before you go I saw they had Time Stoppers in the arcade. I haven't played since I was a kid. Do you want to play with me?"
>Her excitement is admittedly cute. You can't say no. 
>Eventually you hit another game over screen and while she fishes for change you notice an employee pointedly sweeping up near you. 
>You decide to end the game there but on your way out you realize you never returned the rented shoes.
>The two of you say your final goodbyes for the night and you pop back in to get your shoes and head out. 
>The sun has already set long ago and the hour is deep into night time. 
>As you make your way down the alley a door just ahead of you slams open. 
>A rough looking boar in a stained tank top drunkenly stumbles out with an angry possum wearing an apron at her heels.
>"Sandy you git your ass back here! You didn't pay yer tab again!"
>"Aw fuck you Marg I'll pay next time, you know I'm good for it."
>"You've been sayin' that for months you slob!" 
>It's at this moment that they both notice you.
>The boar has a strange look in her eye.
>The possum is the first to say anything. "Stop gawkin' boy, scoot!" 
>Not really anywhere to go but past them so you try to hurry around the boar, but she stops you.
>"Now hold on there, handsome. No need to run away so fast." 
>She is completely incapable of putting on any charms and her drunken state only makes it worse.
>You try to say something about needing to get to work tomorrow but she puts a massive hand against your chest and slams you into a wall. 
>You're stunned but you can make out the possum shouting something at the boar. 
>The sour musk of the boar is almost overpowered by the awful stench of alcohol on her breath. 
>"Nuh-uh I'm tired of boys running from me."
>With that she presses her snout against your face and forces her disgusting tongue into your mouth. 
>You retch and try to turn your head away but she grabs your throat and jaw with a meaty hand and holds you in place, threatening to throttle you. 
>You try to push her away but only manage to kneed her sweaty, doughy tits. 
>This seems to encourage her even further.
>She finally pulls back and as you are sputtering and gasping for air she turns up the heat. 
>"You really like that don't ya, hot stuff! Maybe I'll just claim you right here!" 
>You pull at the arm holding your head to the wall desperately but you're no match for her. 
>"C'mere!" 
>She pulls you towards her by the neck and her maw dives onto your shoulder. 
>Her flat teeth thankfully don't puncture your skin but the extreme pressure has you screaming in pain. 
>You redouble your efforts to break her off of you but she only squeezes tighter on your neck and shoulder while shaking you back and forth. 
>You can distinctly hear the possum shouting "Sandy what the fuck!" over your wailing.
>Suddenly your whole consciousness is filled with the distinct feeling of her tusk piercing the skin of your neck and sliding smoothly into your throat.
>Your fight ends there.
>Your wish to get claimed was granted by an evil genie in the most malicious way. 
>You got what you asked for and now you're fucking dead for it. 

>That's as much as you can remember when you wake up in a foreign bed surrounded by beeping machines and tubes sticking out of every part of you body.
>You feel like shit.
>Weak, worst hangover of the century, violated. 
>You can almost still taste her in your mouth. 
>one of the machines is sounding an alarm and a few moments later a ferret in a white coat arrives to silence it. 
>"Mr. Mous, you've had quite a scuffle. How do you feel now?"
>You only groan in response, not having the energy to respond verbally. 
>"We don't have an emergency contact on file for you. Is there someone you would like us to get a hold of?"
"Phone... Please." 
>She leaves your field of view for a moment and returns with your phone. You barely have the strength take it from her but you manage to open up David's contact and hand it back to her. 
>"We can contact this person for you. In the meantime you've lost a huge amount of blood so I'm going to up your medicine so that you can rest and recover, okay?"
>You nod weakly. 
>She presses a button on one of the machines by your bed and you feel yourself quickly succumb to the medicine.
