#Team Moonshine: The Evolution Situation

[TOC2]

##Prologue

A machamp and a golbat sat in their camp, drinking to their success. The forest they’d set up camp in, formerly known as Apple Woods, made for a perfect campground. After some mysterious events rumored to have involved the Clover Guild, the forest had found itself in a perpetual inferno. Because of this new hazard, and the lack of the perfect apples the forest had once been known for, many of its inhabitants had fled the woods and common pokemon stopped traveling there. The only pokemon going through the woods these days were usually smugglers trading in rare treasures. The thick smoke constantly permeating from the woods made these smugglers easy pickings for ambitious outlaws.

In just two weeks of escaping jail, Machamp and Golbat had already racked up a large stash of valuable treasures. In such a short time, they’d turned from fugitives without a penny to their name to some of the wealthiest thieves in the territory. Their treasure pile stacked high and spread all over the camp.

“I tell ya, Golby. Not a single gang’s gonna mess with us with all this loot,” Machamp boasted while roasting a skewered bean sausage over a bushfire.

“I thought gangs hunted people with the most treasure, though,” Golbat said.

“Well, we’re not keepin’ all of it. We’ll just sell off some of it and hire a bit of muscle. Y’know, besides me, of course,” Machamp laughed.

“Maybe we could start a gang of our own with this?” Golbat suggested. “We could claim these woods, make it our home. Wouldn’t that be nice?”

“Eh… I’d prefer a place that isn’t constantly on fire.”

“Maybe we could find an island somewhere, then. A tropical paradise for ourselves?”

“That ain’t sustainable, mate,” Machamp said. “Besides, we’d be all alone there. A big ol’ island with just the two of us doesn’t sound like a great time to me.”

“I mean… I wouldn’t mind,” Golbat mumbled.

“What the hell’s that supposed to mean?” Machamp glared.

“N-nothing! I just, you know it’d be-”

“I swear to the fuckin’ gods, Golby, you cut that queer shit out or I’ll-”

“STOP RIGHT THERE!” A high-pitched voice called.

The two outlaws turned to see a familiar sylveon, vileplume, and bellossom.

“Well I’ll be! If it isn’t the bastards who put us in that rotten jail,” Machamp said with a fiendish grin.

“You two lost to us last time!” Enny declared. “Surrender now, and we’ll show mercy!”

“I don’t think we’ll be doing that, ‘princess’,” Machamp chuckled. “If I remember that last fight right, I wailed on your two seeders, and you were busy gettin’ mauled by Golby here.”

“Hey, our sleep powder worked eventually!” Vileplume yelled.

“Yeah, well good news. I won’t be making that mistake again,” Machamp said as he walked over to the treasure pile. He reached inside and pulled out two chesto berries.

“Not so strong without your little sleep powders, huh?” Golbat mocked.

“That wasn’t our plan,” a dark voice growled from the treasure pile.

As Machamp turned to identify the voice, he was assaulted by a wave of psychic energy, along with several valuable jewels and orbs. Adrian, who had been hiding inside the treasure pile, leaped out from his hiding place and pounced on Machamp. Enny joined in the attack, shooting off disarming voices at the outlaw.

Golbat zipped across the camp to Bellossom and sank his fangs into her. Vileplume tried to wrestle him off, only to get knocked back by his wings. Bellossom was completely overwhelmed by Golbat, unable to produce any powders or spores while she was being attacked. Vileplume quickly rustled through his bag, looking for something to use that would get the creature off his sister. He found a bundle of corsola twigs, which he quickly threw at the bat.

As soon as Golbat was hit by the twigs, he let go of Bellossom and flew towards Vileplume. Before he could reach his new target, Vileplume shot out a cloud of stun spores, paralyzing the bat in the air. As soon as the creature hit the ground, Vileplume ran over to his sister. 

“Oh my god, Bell!”

She laid on her back, barely able to move and covered in scratches. In the short time Golbat had attacked her, he left some pretty bad injuries. A dark purple poison oozed from her wounds and dripped from her mouth. Her eyes were covered in a thick fog, and she was completely unresponsive.

“Bell, I’m so sorry I let this happen! I should’ve gotten him off! I should’ve- damn it all!” Vileplume cursed to himself as he picked up Bellossom’s bag and searched for something to save his sister. She carried so many tools he didn’t know how to use, and all kinds of bottles with purified berry juices. He continued digging until he found a bottle labeled “Pecha Extract”. Without hesitation, he opened the bottle and poured it down Bellossom’s throat.

Bellossom choked down the medicine. As her eyes cleared up, Vileplume saw her look directly at him. Through all her coughing, and all the pain she must have been in, she managed to give off a small yet reassuring smile.

Vileplume continued to fix up Bellossom, ignoring everything else around him. Adrian and Enny could handle the machamp. Vileplume had to ensure that his sister was safe, first and foremost. He eventually found a large bottle of oran juice and a roll of gauze. He soaked the bandages in juice and wrapped them around his sister.

“Use the… tape when you’re done,” Bellossom muttered.

“How do you remember all this stuff?” Vileplume chuckled as he reached back towards the bag.

“You guys give me plenty of practice.” Bellossom giggled.

“Shut up,” Vileplume laughed as he finished bandaging his sister. 

He helped Bellossom back onto her feet. As soon as she was steady, she wrapped her arms around Vileplume in the tightest hug she could manage. Vileplume smiled as he returned the hug.

This brief moment of comfort between the two was interrupted by a loud crash and a bright light. The two turned to see Machamp running towards Golbat and picking him up, while Enny stood still, staring at the crumbling treasure pile. Bellossom and Vileplume ran over to Enny.

“Why’d you let Machamp go?” Vileplume asked.

“Where’s Adrian?” Bellossom asked.

“He’s in there,” Enny said while pointing at the treasure pile with a ribbon.

The two siblings went silent as they watched the pile continue to shift. The light eventually died down and the treasure pile settled. The three explorers immediately searched the treasure, calling Adrian’s name and digging through all the treasure.

They searched for several minutes with no sign of the umbreon. Vileplume felt so stupid. He shouldn’t have agreed to this plan. Bellossom got badly injured, and Adrian was probably dead. How could he let this happen?

“Guys…” Bellossom’s voice quivered. When Vileplume and Enny turned to look at her, they saw her holding Adrian’s defense scarf, his badge still pinned on it.

The two feared the worst. They walked over slowly, ready to console Bellossom. As they approached, they noticed something moving in the pile.

Suddenly, an eevee, covered in cuts and bruises, burst out of the pile. It panted heavily as it slowly looked up at Bellossom before turning to look at Vileplume and Enny.

“What the fuck happened?” It questioned in a soft and angry voice. “Where's Machamp?”

“No way. No fucking way,” Enny muttered in disbelief.

The eevee examined itself, its panic made apparent.

“WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED?!” The eevee yelled in a high-pitched tone.

“How is this even possible?” Bellossom asked. 

“How do we explain this to the guildmaster?” Vileplume wondered.

##Returning Home

After a few nights, Team Moonshine finally returned to the guild just before sunrise. When they arrived, they found a small, cone-shaped pokemon sleeping on a bench outside the guild. It suddenly awoke as the explorers approached the guild.

“Finally! You must be Team Moonlight,” he said.

“Uh… ‘Moonshine’,” Vileplume corrected.

“Whatever. Did you get my merchandise back?” 

“*You’re* the snorunt who posted the contract?” Enny said, looking weirdly surprised.

“Obviously!” The snorunt rolled his eyes. “Now, where is my merchandise? You were the team sent to get it, so where is it?”

“Your stuff is in the bag here,” Vileplume said while presenting a bag he’d been carrying on his back. “If anything’s missing, you can check with the magnemites. They should be sorting through-”

The snorunt snatched the bag from Vileplume’s hands and started digging through the contents, catching Vileplume off guard. He tossed aside several scarves and coin pouches, showing little care for any of them.

“Did you wait out here the entire time we were gone?” Enny asked.

The snorunt ignored Enny and continued to empty the bag. When he finished searching through the bag, he looked back up at the team.

“Where is the red orb?” He demanded.

“The what?” Vileplume asked, confused.

“The bright red orb! The biggest one on the list!” The snorunt yelled in Vileplume’s face. “That was the most important thing on the list, I circled it in RED ink!”

“Um… we didn’t find a red orb in the pile,” Bellossom whispered.

“Silence girl! I’m speaking to your leader!” The snorunt snapped.

“Hey, don’t talk to my sister like that!” Vileplume warned.

“I’ll speak to you reprobates however I please until you tell me what you’ve done with my orb! You’re the leader of this team, so I will hold you personally responsible for-”

“I’m not the fucking leader! He is!” Vileplume interrupted.

Vileplume pointed to where he believed Adrian had been standing. When he looked over, he noticed Adrian wasn’t there anymore. The newly devolved eevee ran behind Bellossom, eyes locked on the furious snorunt.

Snorunt noticed Adrian sitting there.

“YOU USED THE DEVOLUTION ORB?!” He exploded. “DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT YOU’VE DONE? ANY IDEA HOW RARE THOSE ARE? I SPENT A FORTUNE ON ITS DELIVERY! IT WAS SUPPOSED TO PAY FOR MY RETIREMENT! ”

“We didn’t mean to use it!” Bellossom explained frantically. “It got activated in the middle of the fight. We’d never steal from a client like this, it’s an honest mistake!”

“This is the last time your guild will ever see business from the likes of me again!” Snorunt declared. “Ever since I’ve been working with your guild, I’ve been putting up with ceaseless incompetence and all these derogatory remarks regarding my type! You are all a disgrace! How your guild even became recognized by the federation will forever remain a mystery to me. And since you morons failed your mission, you can say goodbye to the reward money!”

“Now wait just a minute!” Vileplume said. “We worked hard to get through those woods. My sister and I are both grass types. We could’ve died in there easily! And our leader was turned back into an eevee because you didn’t give us the details of what we were retrieving! We got back everything else on your list, so you’re not leaving until we see at least half of what you owe us.”


The snorunt laughed. “I’m not about to be bullied around by an incompetent team that can’t follow the most basic of instructions!”

“This is ridiculous! You can’t just refuse to pay us over a single-”

“Viley,” Enny interrupted. “Let me handle this one.”

Enny took a deep breath and looked the merchant in the eyes. He entered a flamboyant pose, catching everyone off guard. Enny then gave a little wink as he released a couple pink balls of energy around him, taking the form of hearts. The hearts then shot out towards the merchant.

“Enny, stop!” VIleplume shouted. “We can’t fight our clients!”

“Oh relax, silly. Haven’t you ever seen Attract in use before?” Enny giggled before pointing towards the snorunt, now staring longingly at Enny. 

The rest of Team Moonshine watched as Enny approached and flirted with the merchant for several minutes. When the two finally parted ways, Enny went back over to his team.

“So the merchant was planning to pay us with the profit he’d have made off the devolution orb. Since he doesn’t have it, he said we can take the rest of the stuff we brought back as a reward,” Enny explained.

“Wait… that doesn’t make any sense,” Vileplume said.

“Yeah, what exactly are we getting paid for? He won’t have his orb or his stuff,” Bellossom pointed out.

“Oh, that’s the other part,” Enny noted. “I struck up a deal. See, he wants to apologize for Adrian being devolved. Everything else was just gonna be resold to the kecleon market, so it’s of no major value to him. Especially now that his orb is gone.”

“With all the sugar talk you two had, I don’t really believe that explanation. Why did he actually pay us?”

“Well… let’s just say I won’t be available for any missions tomorrow.” Enny said with a smile.

***

Team Moonshine gathered all the items their client had haphazardly tossed around the front of the guild.  Once they scrapped everything together, Vileplume estimated it was collectively worth a little under half the reward for their mission. At the very least, they did get paid. Once they got all their stuff together, the team went back to their room to rest for the day while Adrian met with the guildmaster for a mission report. 

That is until Vileplume noticed him following the rest of the team.

“Adrian, aren’t you gonna meet with the guildmaster?” Vileplume asked.

“I don’t really want to…” Adrian mumbled.

“What do you mean you don’t want to? You always meet with him. You’re the leader!” Enny pointed out.

“I think he’ll be mad…” Adrian said, to the shock of his entire team.

“When have you ever cared about people being mad at you?” Enny said.

“Adrian, are you feeling alright? You’re acting strange,” Bellossom asked.

“I’m fine! I’m just… not used to being an eevee, that’s all.”

Enny sighed. “Well, unfortunately, you’re still the leader of our team. You have to tell the guildmaster how our mission went, even if it was a failure.”

“But I don’t wanna do it! I haven’t screwed up a mission like this before. I don’t know what he’ll do!”

Vileplume decided to step up. “What if I go with you to see the guildmaster? I can explain the situation. You won’t be in trouble.”

Adrian looked up at Vileplume. “Would you?”

“I’m not that tired. I can stay up another half hour if it means you’ll do your job,” Vileplume said.

“Alright, let’s go then,” Adrian said as he headed off to see the guildmaster with Vileplume following close behind.

***

“Heh, that mission was kind of a mess,” Lliam chuckled after hearing the full report of the mission from Adrian and Vileplume. “I don’t think I’ve heard of a mission going that bad since Apple Woods was burnt down in the first place.”

“Yeah, it was pretty bad,” Vileplume said. “Wait, did the guild have something to do with Apple Woods?”

The guildmaster quickly shifted the subject. “So did you guys get paid for the stuff you *did* bring back?”

“Oh, right! Enny struck up some kind of deal with the merchant. We got about half of what we were supposed to be paid,” Vileplume mentioned.

“Alright. You guys can keep it, and I’ll cover the Federation’s taxes. I figure you’ve dealt with enough problems for this mission. If there was some kind of transaction though, whether official or not, they’ll probably assume we’re evading taxes and try to have us shut down.”

“They wouldn’t shut us down for such a small amount of money, would they?” Vileplume asked.

“Oh, believe me. They’ve been trying to have us shut down for a long time,” Lliam said. “You don’t need to worry about that, though. Adrian, what are your plans now that you’ve been made into an eevee?”

The two looked over at the eevee. He shook like a leaf and didn’t say a word.

“Yeah… he’s been acting like this since we pulled him out of that treasure pile,” Vileplume explained.

“I see,” Lliam noted while keeping an eye on Adrian. “Well, I don’t think Adrian’s really fit to remain the leader of your team right now. You’ve been taking a lot of initiative in your missions, so maybe you’d like to take his place for the time being, Vileplume?”

Vileplume was caught off guard by the sudden promotion. “Woah, I don’t think I can really lead a team. I’ve done it once in an emergency before, and we nearly died. I’m not qualified for it.”

“Well to be honest, I don’t think anyone on your team is really qualified to lead,” Lliam stated bluntly. “Adrian was only set up as your leader because of his prior experience, and because his skills were being wasted in his bedroom. Your sister’s nice, but she can’t really handle pressure. Enny might be competent, but I don’t think you want him representing you guys. Plus, he only knows like one move,”

“Actually two apparently,” Vileplume interjected. “He learned Attract at some point, and apparently it turns pokemon gay.”

“Excuse me?” Lliam said with surprise. “That move leverages the target’s attraction, not the user’s. It can’t ‘turn pokemon gay’.”

“Well our client seemed pretty horny when Enny used Attract on him,” Vileplume said.

“Your client was a snorunt merchant, correct?”

“Yeah? Why does that matter?”

“I keep tabs on some of our frequent clients. Enny didn’t turn that mon gay. His preferences are pretty well known at the Blue Claw Inn.”

“Hey, can we change the fucking subject?” Adrian suddenly piped up. When all the attention came back to him, though, he quickly lost his nerve again.

Vileplume looked over at Adrian. “You know, I think that’s actually something I wanted to ask about. Do you know if we can undo what happened to Adrian?”

“Hm… I’m not too familiar with devolution orbs. They aren't exactly common, even by orb standards…” The guildmaster said. “As far as I’m aware, its effects aren’t reversible. If you want Adrian back to normal, he’s gonna have to evolve.”

“That’s not possible,” Vileplume said. “My sister and I waited years for our chance to evolve.  It’ll be years before Luminous Spring opens again!”

“Well that’d be true… if Luminous Spring was the only place where pokemon can evolve,” Lliam hinted.

“What are you talking about? Where else would we go to have him evolve?”

“Luminous Spring is pretty well known, but it’s not the only one. There are evolution ‘zones’ all over the world, Vileplume.”

“Do you know where they are?”

“I know a couple,” Lliam said. “The problem is, for most zones, you’ll need an item for him to evolve. That is, unless you’re okay with having two sylveons on your team.”

“ABSOLUTELY NOT!” Adrian shouted.

“You said most zones. Are there any that don’t require items?” Vileplume asked.

“Well I know of one zone. To reach it, you need to go through Primeval Forest and see the Xerneas there.”


“A Xerneas?!” Vileplume gasped. “There’s no way we can do that, especially with Adrian in the state that he’s in.”

Lliam nodded. “The last place I can think of, within reason, is in the Air Continent. A long time ago, a meteor threatened to destroy the world, but Rayquaza shot it out of the sky and destroyed it. One of the fragments landed in a pokemon village there. Supposedly, that fragment has the power to evolve pokemon.”

“That’s just another human legend, though,” Vileplume said. “There’s no way that actually happened.”

“You’re in a guild surrounded by former humans and a Rayquaza shooting a meteor out of the sky is the part you don’t believe?” Lliam questioned.

“Okay, good point… We’ll still need to get an item for him though.”

“A lunar ribbon!” Adrian blurted out. “I won’t accept anything else!”

“Woah, slow down there,” Lliam said. “Evolution is permanent. You have the opportunity to completely change your type, and that could be a huge advantage for your team. Are you sure you don’t-”

“I’m not reconsidering this!” Adrian argued. “I liked being an umbreon, even if it ruined my sleep schedule. Besides, we’re Team fucking Moonshine. Me, and our nocturnal behavior, are the fucking symbols of our team!”

“He’s not wrong,” Vileplume admitted, agreeing with Adrian. “Besides, it’s his choice. If he says he wants to be an umbreon, I’m not gonna stop him.”

“I wasn’t trying to dissuade you, I just wanted to make sure you were certain,” the guildmaster said. “If you want to be an umbreon, I can’t take that away from you. It will narrow your options down, though.”

“I made my decision!” Adrian declared.

“At least he’s got some of his energy back,” Vileplume chuckled.

***

Vileplume awoke in his bed the following afternoon. When he looked around, he saw the Bellossom was already awake and Enny had already left. Adrian was still sleeping in his nest of pillows. When he finally woke up, the three went to the mess hall for dinner.
Upon entering the mess hall, Vileplume noticed a couple odd stares from some of the people eating. He noticed most of the staring was directed towards Adrian. It seemed nobody in the guild recognized him as an eevee.
Bellossom and Adrian sat down while Vileplume went to pick up food for his table. He returned with three bowls of chili, one smaller than the rest. The team ate silently for a while until a very ecstatic wooper suddenly approached their table.
“Hi! Is that a new member of your guys' team?”
“Uh… Wooper, this isn’t-” Bellossom tried to interject.
“Hey eevee! I heard you like mudkips!” Wooper said.
“Shut the fuck up,” Adrian replied
“Another human!” Wooper declared triumphantly. “It’s funny. The umbreon on your guys’ team had the exact same response.”
Vileplume began to say, “Yeah, that’s probably because-”
“Wooper!” A chespin called out, chasing after his partner. “You can’t keep running off every time you see a new-”
“Chespin, you won’t believe it! Vileplume and Bellossom found another human, and it’s an eevee!”
“He’s not another human!” Vileplume blurted out. “This is Adrian, the umbreon, our team’s leader.”
The two were taken aback. “That’s the umbreon who tried to kill Cyndaquil in the mess hall?” Chespin asked in disbelief.
“He wasn’t trying to kill him,” Bellossom said in his defense.
“It’s not important right now. Adrian got turned into an eevee by some orb and we’re trying to figure out how to get him back to normal,” Vileplume explained.
“A devolution orb?” Chespin guessed. “Wooper and I have had a few run-ins with those before.”
“And you’re both still unevolved?” Bellossom questioned.
“Yeah! That’s why we went looking for them in the first place!” Wooper said with a somehow wider smile.
“Wooper and I thought it would be a good idea to evolve when Luminous Spring opened up, but we ended up regretting it big time,” Chespin said.
“But didn’t it make you stronger? More mature?” Vileplume asked.
“It didn’t make us mature, it changed who we were completely! Wooper and I acted like totally different people. Being a Chesnaught made me talk like a kid larping as a knight, impossible to enter my own room, and I wasn’t able to feel my blanket anymore. It was horrible.”
Vileplume tilted his head in confusion. “Larping? I… guess I could see a human finding evolution strange. Wooper though?”
“I just wasn’t the same as a quagsire. Besides, we work better with each other this way,” Wooper said.
“How so?” Vileplume asked.
“Well when Chespin and I fight, he usually picks me up with his vines while I shoot at people,” Wooper explained. “It lets me use my Hydro Pump at its full power without having to deal with the recoil!”
“That’s pretty creative, actually. I’m impressed,” Vileplume said.
“Evolution doesn't always make you stronger. Physical power isn't everything in a fight,” Chespin said.
“I don’t think Viley and I changed too much when we evolved besides acting more our age. We never learned to fight as oddish, though,” Bellossom said. “I guess it just depends on the pokemon.”
“I just wish Adrian took his devolution as well as you two did,” Vileplume said. The two teams looked over at Adrian who, now having everyone’s attention, immediately ducked his head under the table.
“Has he always been this timid?” Chespin asked.
“No!” Adrian shouted from under the table.
“I’m not really sure why he's acting this way,” Vileplume said.
“Well I mentioned how when I evolved, I started talking like a knight. I think it’s safe to say your form can have some impact on how you act. Maybe him getting turned into an eevee has made him more like a kid in some way,” Chespin speculated.
“You might be onto something there.”
“Yeah… so do you guys have a plan for how you’re gonna get Adrian evolved again?” Chespin asked.
“Yeah actually. Right now we need to find an item that’ll let him evolve. We already know where we’re going for this,” Vileplume said.
“Would you guys like some help? We could join you,” Chespin offered.
“I don’t think that’s a good idea. It’ll be a long trip. We’re going to the Air Continent. Apparently Pokemon Square has a spot that lets pokemon evolve.”
Wooper got really excited upon hearing that. “I know that place! That’s where my parents evolved!”
“So it’s not just a legend?”
“Of course not! Luminous Cave is like, THE place where pokemon evolve in the Air Continent!”
“Well at least we know it’s reliable. That’s where we’re going, though,” Vileplume said.
Chespin nodded. “Well if we can’t join you for the trip, maybe we could give you some supplies?”
“That would actually be really helpful,” Vileplume said. “We only got paid half the reward for our last mission, so we’re kind of low on cash.”
“Cool! Just stop by our room before you leave. We’ll see what we can get you.”

***

Chespin and Wooper left Team Moonshine to finish eating. After dinner, Vileplume and Bellossom dropped Adrian off at their room as they went out to the Capim Town market to try their luck at finding a lunar ribbon.

“Sorry, but we're all out of lunar ribbons right now,” the green Kecleon brother apologized.

“We do have evolution stones right now at 10% off,” the purple one said.

“Do you think Adrian would be fine with any other elements? A Vaporeon would cover our weakness to fire,” Bellossom suggested.

“He was pretty adamant when he said he wanted to be an umbreon,” Vileplume sighed before turning to face the kecleons again. “Do you guys know when you’ll be getting any lunar ribbons again?”

“Oh, it’s hard to say. The only place they're known to appear in this continent is Zero Isle,” the green kecleon said.

“It could be weeks or even months until we can order another one!”

Bellossom and Vileplume hung their heads in disappointment.

“There's no way we can take on Zero Isle,” Bellossom pouted. 

“Maybe we'll get lucky and find one in the Air Continent somewhere.”

“You’re headed to the Air Continent?” The two brothers asked in unison.

“Uh, yeah? It’s the only place where we can get our friend evolved right now,” Vileplume said.

“Well if you’re headed there, our brothers in Pokemon Square will surely be able to help you get a lunar ribbon!” The green kecleon said.

“In fact, if you’d be willing to do a delivery job for us, we could get you a voucher for whatever item you want from their shop!” The purple kecleon offered. 

“You guys have more brothers? I thought you were a local business?” Vileplume asked.

“Kecleon Brothers is an internationally recognized brand with ties all over the world!” The purple kecleon declare proudly.

“And right now, we’re working on tying something up in the Air Continent right now!” The green kecleon said. “All we need to finalize the deal is for this package to be delivered.”

Bellossom looked to Vileplume and he nodded in response. “Alright then! We’ll do it!” 

“Excellent!” The green kecleon said as his brother reached under the counter and presented a finely crafted wooden box wrapped with a tight string.

“A few miles north of Pokemon Square, there’s a shopkeeper who goes by the name ‘Floatzel’. Deliver this package to him and return to Pokemon Square for your voucher.”

Vileplume picked up the box. It was oddly heavy despite its small size, but it seemed ordinary enough. “Is there a date this needs to be delivered by?”

“No, you can take as much time as you need. However, under no circumstances should you open that box.”

“Also, the contents inside are fragile, so do take good care of it.”

“Alright. We’ll get it delivered as soon as possible,” Vileplume said.

“Wonderful to hear! Good luck with your journey!”

And with that, Vileplume and Bellossom set off to the guild. With a new plan to get Adrian back to normal, and a new mission, they felt far more hopeful for the future than they had in a while.
