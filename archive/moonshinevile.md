#Team Moonshine: The Evolution Situation

A machamp and a golbat sat in their camp, drinking to their success. The forest they’d set up camp in, formerly known as Apple Woods, made for a perfect campground. After some mysterious events rumored to have involved the Clover Guild, the forest had found itself in a perpetual inferno. Because of this new hazard, and the lack of the perfect apples the forest had once been known for, many of its inhabitants had fled the woods and common pokemon stopped traveling there. The only pokemon going through the woods these days were usually smugglers trading in rare treasures. The thick smoke constantly permeating from the woods made these smugglers easy pickings for ambitious outlaws.

In just two weeks of escaping jail, Machamp and Golbat had already racked up a large stash of valuable treasures. In such a short time, they’d turned from fugitives without a penny to their name to some of the wealthiest thieves in the territory. Their treasure pile stacked high and spread all over the camp.

“I tell ya, Golby. Not a single gang’s gonna mess with us with all this loot,” Machamp boasted while roasting a skewered bean sausage over a bushfire.

“I thought gangs hunted people with the most treasure, though,” Golbat said.

“Well, we’re not keepin’ all of it. We’ll just sell off some of it and hire a bit of muscle. Y’know, besides me, of course,” Machamp laughed.

“Maybe we could start a gang of our own with this?” Golbat suggested. “We could claim these woods, make it our home. Wouldn’t that be nice?”

“Eh… I’d prefer a place that isn’t constantly on fire.”

“Maybe we could find an island somewhere, then. A tropical paradise for ourselves?”

“That ain’t sustainable, mate,” Machamp said. “Besides, we’d be all alone there. A big ol’ island with just the two of us doesn’t sound like a great time to me.”

“I mean… I wouldn’t mind,” Golbat mumbled.

“What the hell’s that supposed to mean?” Machamp glared.

“N-nothing! I just, you know it’d be-”

“I swear to the fuckin’ gods, Golby, you cut that queer shit out or I’ll-”

“STOP RIGHT THERE!” A high-pitched voice called.

The two outlaws turned to see a familiar sylveon, vileplume, and bellossom.

“Well I’ll be! If it isn’t the bastards who put us in that rotten jail,” Machamp said with a fiendish grin.

“You two lost to us last time!” Enny declared. “Surrender now, and we’ll show mercy!”

“I don’t think we’ll be doing that, ‘princess’,” Machamp chuckled. “If I remember that last fight right, I wailed on your two seeders, and you were busy gettin’ mauled by Golby here.”

“Hey, our sleep powder worked eventually!” Vileplume yelled.

“Yeah, well good news. I won’t be making that mistake again,” Machamp said as he walked over to the treasure pile. He reached inside and pulled out two chesto berries.

“Not so strong without your little sleep powders, huh?” Golbat mocked.

“That wasn’t our plan,” a dark voice growled from the treasure pile.

As Machamp turned to identify the voice, he was assaulted by a wave of psychic energy, along with several valuable jewels and orbs. Adrian, who had been hiding inside the treasure pile, leaped out from his hiding place and pounced on Machamp. Enny joined in the attack, shooting off disarming voices at the outlaw.

Golbat zipped across the camp to Bellossom and sank his fangs into her. Vileplume tried to wrestle him off, only to get knocked back by his wings. Bellossom was completely overwhelmed by Golbat, unable to produce any powders or spores while she was being attacked. Vileplume quickly rustled through his bag, looking for something to use that would get the creature off his sister. He found a bundle of corsola twigs, which he quickly threw at the bat.

As soon as Golbat was hit by the twigs, he let go of Bellossom and flew towards Vileplume. Before he could reach his new target, Vileplume shot out a cloud of stun spores, paralyzing the bat in the air. As soon as the creature hit the ground, Vileplume ran over to his sister. 

“Oh my god, Bell!”

She laid on her back, barely able to move and covered in scratches. In the short time Golbat had attacked her, he left some pretty bad injuries. A dark purple poison oozed from her wounds and dripped from her mouth. Her eyes were covered in a thick fog, and she was completely unresponsive.

“Bell, I’m so sorry I let this happen! I should’ve gotten him off! I should’ve- damn it all!” Vileplume cursed to himself as he picked up Bellossom’s bag and searched for something to save his sister. She carried so many tools he didn’t know how to use, and all kinds of bottles with purified berry juices. He continued digging until he found a bottle labeled “Pecha Extract”. Without hesitation, he opened the bottle and poured it down Bellossom’s throat.

Bellossom choked down the medicine. As her eyes cleared up, Vileplume saw her look directly at him. Through all her coughing, and all the pain she must have been in, she managed to give off a small yet reassuring smile.

Vileplume continued to fix up Bellossom, ignoring everything else around him. Adrian and Enny could handle the machamp. Vileplume had to ensure that his sister was safe, first and foremost. He eventually found a large bottle of oran juice and a roll of gauze. He soaked the bandages in juice and wrapped them around his sister.

“Use the… tape when you’re done,” Bellossom muttered.

“How do you remember all this stuff?” Vileplume chuckled as he reached back towards the bag.

“You guys give me plenty of practice.” Bellossom giggled.

“Shut up,” Vileplume laughed as he finished bandaging his sister. 

He helped Bellossom back onto her feet. As soon as she was steady, she wrapped her arms around Vileplume in the tightest hug she could manage. Vileplume smiled as he returned the hug.

This brief moment of comfort between the two was interrupted by a loud crash and a bright light. The two turned to see Machamp running towards Golbat and picking him up, while Enny stood still, staring at the crumbling treasure pile. Bellossom and Vileplume ran over to Enny.

“Why’d you let Machamp go?” Vileplume asked.

“Where’s Adrian?” Bellossom asked.

“He’s in there,” Enny said while pointing at the treasure pile with a ribbon.

The two siblings went silent as they watched the pile continue to shift. The light eventually died down and the treasure pile settled. The three explorers immediately searched the treasure, calling Adrian’s name and digging through all the treasure.

They searched for several minutes with no sign of the umbreon. Vileplume felt so stupid. He shouldn’t have agreed to this plan. Bellossom got badly injured, and Adrian was probably dead. How could he let this happen?

“Guys…” Bellossom’s voice quivered. When Vileplume and Enny turned to look at her, they saw her holding Adrian’s defense scarf, his badge still pinned on it.

The two feared the worst. They walked over slowly, ready to console Bellossom. As they approached, they noticed something moving in the pile.

Suddenly, an eevee, covered in cuts and bruises, burst out of the pile. It panted heavily as it slowly looked up at Bellossom before turning to look at Vileplume and Enny.

“What the fuck happened?” It questioned in a soft and angry voice. “Where's Machamp?”

“No way. No fucking way,” Enny muttered in disbelief.

The eevee examined itself, its panic made apparent.

“WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED?!” The eevee yelled in a high-pitched tone.

“How is this even possible?” Bellossom asked. 

“How do we explain this to the guildmaster?” Vileplume wondered.
