You are the only one who knows the true meaning behind all of this and you are earths last best hope for a savior. Together with a group of sexy characters nicknamed "Counters" and regular soldiers and even sentient Mechs you take on the job of preserving what is left of the earth before judgement day. This plays out through combat where you deploy characters with resource points and they attempt to get to the enemy and destroy them while the enemy will also be doing the same to you.
