Damn. Damn everything.

The assignment was to take out the alpha wolf and eliminate or scatter the rest. Simple, easy to follow, yet his feelings got in the way. Now he wasn't so sure of this assignment as he was in the beginning. A human willingly going to them without turning? Being kept alive instead of killed and ripped to shreds as they ate? None of this made sense, all werewolves had an urge to kill their prey!

One out of all was the most difficult to process. Adam, the sweetheart grey wolf was single handedly making sure he was being treated right. That he was given heat during brisk winter storms, that he wouldn't be attacked by the pack of wolves still angry of a bold attack on their home. Yet another complicating issue: they'd treated him like garbage but on further inspection they seemingly lived normal lives on their own. Nick shouldn't have ruined that for these newly discovered docile werewolves.

To make matters even more insulting a few nights ago during the festive holiday season Nikolai had decided to let the friendly one hold him. Yes, Adam called it a way that the wolves bond but however true it was (or wasn't) couldn't stop what happened next. One way or another it had led to him getting a hard-on, despite no previous attractions to men or werewolves. More concerning due to the fact he was getting hot for a sworn enemy, no less. The circumstances might have played a fair share, being held and told sweet things and all. One thing was certain, he wasn't getting feelings for Adam but the thought of doing it with him still caused excitement. So he seemed interested in a guy, a werewolf even, and that was… new.

Ever since then he'd been holed up in his cabin to mull over it. Dominic, their alpha, had regularly stopped by to feed him and each time they sat at the small kitchen table but usually said nothing. If the old alpha knew what happened he offered no words, which was better to prevent any awkwardness. Adam didn't stop by as often the past few days, probably feeling it best to keep some distance. Funny, at first he despised seeing the grey fur and now he was missing its company.

Noon ticked by while he idly lounged about and the alpha slipped through the door. In one hand was a package of soda and the other a picnic basket full of sandwiches, presumably. Still no change in his demeanor to indicate any disappointment. They sat as usual and evened out their portions. Here goes nothing, Nick thought.

"Dominic, is Adam ok?"

"He is. Why do you ask?", the grizzled wolf said as he took a few clubs out.

"He wanted to spend Christmas with me. Some stuff happened, I ended up… um…"

"You got frisky?" his face shifted into slight disapproval.

"No! No, but we… cuddled. Or he wanted to, and I thought 'what the hell, why not it's Christmas', and.."

"And he managed to get you a little excited?"

Nick could feel his cheeks burning at the question and though the alpha seemed amused, there was clear disapproval behind his eyes.

"I.. I don't think I'm gay. I don't see any of you that way, and how could I? Can't just be attracted to a werewolf like that, right? But when Adam did it I just felt so weird."

Dominic swallowed his sandwich and sighed, "Hm. So I don't really feel like dealing with a hunter getting horny for one of my pack members. You're gonna need to deal with this on your own, with or without his help."

Permission granted, more or less. That is if Nick decided to do anything about it. He'd been told it was fine to like guys, but sleeping with a werewolf was less of a dip and more of a throw yourself in the pool with rocks tied to you.

"Kindly think of him fucking you some other time, I can smell your needy scent," Dominic said as he ate.

The rest of it was eaten in quiet thoughts and silence otherwise. Bacon strips in between, mayo and pickle, provolone, whoever their cook was made some damn good food. Dominic left the pack of soda and a few leftover sandwiches behind as a dinner for him.

Dominic, not alpha, another wolf to refer to by their name. If he stood a chance at understanding them, then he'd best start trying to learn who they were. One was Shane, the black and yellow tinted wolf he'd had a brief standoff with. Besides calling one brown, the rest were still strangers and wouldn't be so keen to approach him. The other one he'd fought in the woods aside from Adam and Dominic would be another challenge entirely.

Speaking of the grey furred companion…..

"Sup bro, you doing ok?", said Adam as he walked in, dressed in some casual clothes in contrast to the rest of the pack.

"I'm fine."

"Fine?", Adam leaned on the wall, a curious tuft of fur raising on his forehead.

Nikolai gulped, let a deep breath of air in and out then chose his next words carefully. If he'd been through grueling training, harsh exercise, and verbal assaults rivaling a drill instructor, he could do this.

"I think I want to try some stuff. G-gay stuff, with you."

"Wait, you wanna experiment with me?", Adam seemed a bit surprised at the proposal.

Careful consideration and much thought put into it, he'd come to the conclusion that he simply should have sex with Adam.

Even if he was another man.

And a werewolf.

A rough challenge, no doubt about it.

"So you decided you like guys?" Adam approached him smugly, "And you need me to help out?"

"If you want to," Nick looked sideways and scratched the back of his head.

"Well c'mon! No use waiting, right?" Adam led him by hand to the bed. Nick smiled at the wagging tail, cute.

Adam's fur and all disappeared and left only skin for his regular and rarely seen human self. Shorter in human form but still tall, just a few inches taller in fact. The now baggy shirt was slowly pulled away to reveal a hairy back and some love handles to him. The pants were just as loose, and the shape of his ass in the outline was.. nice. Nick found himself gazing at his hefty behind a bit longer than what was appropriate, so he averted his eyes.

Something about seeing his curves underneath made him blush, or maybe that was just because he was looking at his butt. Liking guys meant you had to look at their private bits, right?

"You ok?" Adam asked him as he turned around.

The man's belly was somehow rounder when exposed and his chest a bit flabbier, the arms did have some visible muscle though. Hairy as hell of course but very thick all around. Adam didn't seem to know how badly this was flustering him even if he felt his cheeks lighting up.

"Y-yeah. I'm fine, I'll get ready."

Nikolai first took off his plain shirt and for a moment there was a feeling holding him back from the rest. No, he'd come this far to do something, he could keep stripping down for him. His jeans slipped off easily with the underwear similarly coming loose. So far nothing had triggered a reaction so maybe this all was a fluke. Adam watched with great interest and a visible tent pitched in his briefs. Jesus, how big was he down there?

"Guess I'll take mine off too!", his friend said excitedly.

Oh, not too big then, but despite a shorter length it was considerably thick. A manageable size for his first time with a guy, probably. Adam hopped in the bed and crossed his legs, patting the spot in front of him and brightly smiling. Still no reaction from himself. He knelt in the spot indicated and waited for him to do, well, anything.

"So… what'd you wanna try?"

"I um.. do we rub our dicks together or..", the hunter felt slightly embarrassed at not knowing what to do.

"I mean we can! There's other stuff we can do, I could lead you along," Adam said in a soft tone.

Oh, that did something. A lot judging by how quick he'd begun to spring up. One of his hands covered it as he blushed and struggled to find the right words. But they weren't needed as his hands were pulled away, and the look in those beautiful blue eyes told him not to worry. Adam sat a bit more forward until his dick pressed against his, his hand slowly stroking together and oh…. that felt so….

"There we go, you're still comfy?", Adam asked.

"Y-yes," he gasped and pressed his hand forward for support.

Instead of the shoulder he thought it was aimed at he was instead grasping one of his chubby pecs. One look down and his face burned even more, still not much to say on his mind. He liked feeling it, of course, but was it weird to talk during sex? No, Adam asked him something a second ago, he could do something considerate as well.

"You're um… you're cute," Nikolai said as he looked sideways.

"Aw, I think you're cute too."

Before he could reply he found Adam pressing a kiss to him. It wasn't long nor was the intent to be a romantic one. Yet just that quick bit of affection did quite a number on him as he felt himself grow a bit harder than before. Maybe they could do it again, if he-

"Adam what the hell are-", Dominic tried to say as he walked in.

The alpha took a look between them and frowned much worse than he usually did. Caught red handed, or should he say red faced? Adam smiled and waved a greeting before going back at the frotting. Why was Dominic still watching? Why was Nick himself still hard despite being caught? Was this normal for them? It shouldn't have been so casual for the otherwise natural enemies and yet here they were.

The old alpha growled and slapped his forehead, turning right back around and nearly slamming the door. Something about the younger members of the pack was uttered out but not fully heard. Adam snickered and set his hands down a moment but Nick wasn't seeing the humor in this.

"Sorry about that, I think he'll give us some privacy now. Wanna make out?", Adam's expression was a bit too knowing, as if he knew how tempting it was.

"I haven't um.. I haven't really practiced that. I'd be bad," so why was he smiling at the thought of kissing him.

"I can help you, I just need you to lie back. Let ol' Adam teach you a few tricks."

The big guy laid beside him and patted the bed, casually winking. Lord knows how long the werewolf had wanted to do this with him. Fortunately he didn't outright shove him into sex with the beast side. Anyway, Nick needed to lie back and get as comfortable as he could.

Despite the soft mattress, pillows and whatnot he couldn't help but feel stiff as a board. Everything was perfect for the two considering the nice bed and blazing heat, and here he was frozen and yet slightly hard. A hand ran up his somewhat flabby abs to play with the tousled happy trail. Stuttered, shy breaths managed to slip free as it made its way up to the chest and played around up there. It squeezed at a few surprisingly stimulating points and to his embarrassment he let out a pleased sigh.

When he managed to open his eyes and look up a pair of pretty blue ones stared back. Once more they kissed, a longer one as Adam let some of his weight pile on him. Fingers brushed away his shaggy hair as he let out a soft, fond moan. So far his helper had been doing all the work and getting nothing in return. Not for long, he thought.

When next he let up Nikolai pulled him back to his own embrace. One hand to hold his head, the other holding the side of his plump belly. It didn't feel as special as the ones Adam had given him, but he'd taken a liking to the chubby heft of him. Warmth enveloping him, feeling the weight press down like a blanket as their legs curled together. Soft moans let out in between that encouraged him to feel more of his body.

"You're not half bad," Adam softly spoke, caressing his face.

"Th-thanks."

"Mind if I taste this thing?" he stroked him off a few times.

"F-feel free."

Adam pressed another few affectionate kisses then headed down to prepare him. On the first lick Nikolai gasped and by the second he let out a few pleasurable huffs. As he started going down on him he felt the corners of his mouth curl into a smile. Fuck, this felt… fantastic. Something kept hitting the bed and it seemed the culprit was Adam who had partially transformed. Some surface level changes like the nose, the tail responsible and.. oh fuck.

At some point the tongue wrapping around his dick had gotten longer, licking at the tip whilst slicking up the rest of it. How could pleasure make his fingers curl and feel so torturous at the same time? Just when he would've begged for mercy Adam pulled off and licked the length of it. Down further until he'd reached his balls. The canine did something funny then, sniffing at them a second and seemingly enjoying it.

And then the overload of ecstasy came back and he swore he'd never felt better in his life. He didn't know how on earth the man had managed to fit both in and jiggle them around. Such a good, good..puppy? Yes, obedient and affectionate, he deserved pets for doing all this.

One of his hands pet his hair and scratched behind his ear. Despite looking like a human with some canine features Adam still hung his tongue out like a common dog.

"You're adorable," he told his pup.

In an instant he felt Adam tackle him down, mindful of the injuries of course. The wet press of his nose tickled the skin that wasn't covered by hair. Fear of being smothered was snuffed out as the wolven tongue dragged under his chin. There wasn't a reason to care when he was so loving.

Well, in a way he still felt uneasy about the prospect of tackling it head on. Doing all of this with his human side was taking an easy route and the partial form could be written off as a sort of dress-up. If he wanted to challenge himself he'd need something else to test it. Maybe it was time to let the beast out of the cage.

"Adam..", he said amidst the lovely presses of affection to his neck.

"Yeah?"

"Can you turn into your wolf?"

"Uh.. after we're done, but you're still hurt from fighting Dominic a while back and I'm way too big as a wolf for your first time."

"I want to try it," Nick was scared, intimidated and worried about what the wolf could do. But he was already used to being held in his fur.

He could do this.

For the first time since they'd begun seeing each other, Adam wasn't exactly comfortable with doing this. This carried over to his wolf's muzzle as it remained still. Nick had his reservations about the size of him and if he would even find him anything close to cute.  But seeing him bathed in golden rays from the window nearby illuminated the incredibly handsome wolf that he'd been denying attraction to.

Yet even as he tried to kiss at him and enjoy his preferred form, Adam remained as a statue throughout. Nikolai explored further down until he gripped around a sort of fat but not too large sheath. New, scary, he could do this. Whatever lied inside needed serious effort to come out, time flew by while he tried whatever new things he'd learned.

"Nick."

In the midst of trying to turn him on the thumping of the tail on the bed had stopped. Aside from failing to get him hard his ears were curved back and Adam seemed reluctant to keep going.

"I um… didn't mean to make things weird," he said, scooching himself away.

"You didn't, but I'm a big guy when I'm like this. Bigger than I normally am, and you're still hurt. If I accidentally cramp you in a bad way we'd be reckless. I need to make sure you're ok."

Nick nodded, "Sorry, I just wanted you to feel uh..comfy."

"I appreciate it," his fur shrunk away as he turned back, "And I'll be happy to be comfy when you're all better."

"If it means anything, you're a very handsome um.. wolf."

"Thank you," another sweet kiss was given to Nick, "You're really cute too."

Small words of praise and somehow a tingling buzz rushed through him from a simple compliment. A part of him broke then, any lingering reluctance gone while he gave into his love. Sweet touches, a kiss to the neck now and then, a whisper of adoration every few seconds. Was this what being loved felt like? To be so cared for that someone could see past your darker surface?

Then it stopped.

Adam had gone down to his crotch again, then the balls. And the next part was something he dreaded ever since seriously considering this. Each lick down the taint only made him feel more squeamish about being licked there. He'd heard of it but never thought someone would seriously enjoy-

Oh. Oh God, oh that was...

In the span of a few finger curling seconds the barrier shattered between fear and pleasure. God, the way Adam slowly dragged over it just to get a noise from him, the smug wolf bastard. Just when he thought he'd achieved bliss it went further, further in and further torturing the embarrassingly lewd moans out. One look down and Adam's tail happily wagged amidst his feast. Oh if only he could pet him for doing such a good job at this.

"Fuck, man! You taste even better than I dreamed of!", Adam said before going back at it.

Good to know? It couldn't taste anything other than average. Questions about it aside, it felt nothing less than heavenly to relax and let him go to town. Even after he'd gotten used to it Adam still managed to surprise him. Leaving and thrusting back in so effortlessly, stretching it out as he throbbed below. Anything leaking out of his dick was quickly cleaned and added to the mess made.

It must've been a half hour before Adam decided to get on with it and try… fucking. Right, he'd been prepped thoroughly and it couldn't hurt that bad. His legs were hoisted over his shoulders as though the excited wolf wanted to see how he'd like it. Adam was silent as he lined it up, slowly pushing up against it but not quite getting in yet. He wasn't soft by any means and probably just teasing before the real fun. Despite being his first time Nick felt a bit eager to move it along.

"Gonna fuck me or not?"

One quick shove and a mix of pain and some small pleasure answered that. No way around that unfortunately, breaking it in was the only way. Odd that it wasn't really doing anything for him.. except. The slow thrusts started to feel so impossibly good that he clenched the pillow and let out a pleasurable sigh.

"Are you ok??", he was asked.

"Y- yeah. Keep going, please.."

Almost immediately they went to a slightly quicker pace. He wasn't the biggest guy on the planet but damn did he know how to fuck like a beast. Every small embarrassed feeling at moaning so loud was extinguished by the happy look on Adam's face. So thick, so caring and kind and oh so eager to help him feel the pleasure course through his body.

It had only been ten minutes and yet he never wanted this feeling to end. Something felt different out of the blue and he wasn't sure but… oh. He was probably about to..

"Mmmngh~"

Poor Adam got a splash of it across his face, then a few more across his chest and a shoulder before the last few dribbled down his own cock. He only smirked and kept his pace, wiping himself off and swallowing like it was his reward. Wolven ears sprang forth and a few other partial features along with a dangerous smile forming on his face. The pace became quick, rough and almost too much for him if it wasn't for the ecstasy powering him through.

A growling kiss shut him up as Adam practically smothered him into the bed. A hard end to it almost went through but not quite and Adam didn't dare himself to try it. His submissive human effectively said 'fuck it' as he pulled his legs in to get the rest. The pain was worse this time but the rest of the apparent knot went in without much trouble. Odd that they could still get one in their human forms but it felt incredible to have it pulse and throb in him. 

When all was finished between the two panting and fairly sweaty men, Adam let out a content sigh. Nikolai had never shot so much of that.. stuff before. He'd always been trained to be alone or take care of it in the bathroom. Some of the excess spunk leaked down to the bedsheet despite still being plugged up. A wet feeling spooked a jump until he realized it was only Adam's loving tongue on his cheek.

The aftercare was mostly one sided, that being a claw lightly scratching his chest as his partner groomed sweaty hair down. He would've liked to at least kiss the wolf back but he'd been fucked well and hard enough to really move at all. Dirty habits would just take getting used to if he wanted to make this a regular occurrence. 

The steady licking pace snapped him from the gross thoughts. A bit of energy rose to let him hug into Adam's huge form, who gladly reciprocated the gesture. Being held so close to someone so warm, so big and ready to give him this affection….

He couldn't just go back to how he lived before.

"So.. can you be a whole wolf now?"

"No problem bro. You alright by the way? Didn't think you could take that."

"I'm fine," Nick mumbled as he got himself comfy.

Fur grew along the muzzle as he watched the transformation. This time there was a sense of fascination by the handsome wolf before him. Somehow the flared dick got bigger with the transformation and yet it wasn't discomforting. It'd be a while before he could pull out, he'd been told, which oddly enough was fine by him. Savoring this moment for as long as he could mattered more.
_____

When morning came to wake the two they decided to sleep in anyway. Only by the sharp raps at the door did Nikolai leave the warm embrace of his friend. The cute pup of his stirred before being told to go back to sleep and enjoy the bed. Nikolai put on some pants and an overshirt and stretched himself out along the way. The only thing still hurting in him was his ass, no way to avoid that after the previous night.

"Helloooo…", his greeting trailed off as he faced an army of wolves, chiefly Brown in front who he still didn't know the name of.

"Hello, hunter," it spitefully said.

Nick tried to smile, "I realize I got off on the wrong foot, can't we-"

"No, you do not get to act friendly with me just because Adam's too naive to see past your hate. Not with any of us."

"So I should start fighting again?"

"Don't get smart with me," Brown growled at him.

Nick sighed, "Look, I..I know you don't trust me. I don't expect you to. I was wrong about this place. So was my organization, they might have lied to me."

"I'd say!" one of the wolves yelled with a few others shouting their agreement.

"Ok, you don't like me. I get it. If you don't forgive me, I get that too. But I'm not gonna be chased off from Adam."

"Well if that's the case we need to set some rules. Do not approach unless we decide to approach you. This extends to the other human you see around camp. Two, everyone contributes food so you better get used to getting some gear on and shooting deer. By yourself."

"What's going on..", a sweetly familiar voice said as two big arms wrapped around him.

"Your friends just wanted to talk, that's all."

"Do we make ourselves clear?" the angry brown and still yet to be named mass of fur asked.

"Yes," the hunter said into venomous yellow eyes.

The slightest of nods was displayed before he left with the rest of the pack. Closely following was the lesser but just as abundant actual wolves. When the last of them had strutted down the trail, one more of them strolled into view. Wolf wasn't accurate of his form at the moment, and for being far grumpier the previous day Dominic wasn't outright hostile.

"You told them?", Nick asked.

"I did. They weren't happy with the idea of you staying put, but my word is law. I could tell you two to be apart and expect no trouble based on your obedience. But you, Adam," the gaze fell squarely on his partner, the hands so eager to worship him retracting.

"You wouldn't obey me. Not because you don't respect me but because you seem to enjoy our hunters company more than anyone else."

"Why'd you let me stay?"

"Well.. much as I hate to say it, you're starting to turn a new leaf. I despised you, still kinda do, and then you started to bond with him. Sleeping with the enemy was beyond my worst expectation and, truthfully,  I hate how quick you're rushing into this. On the bright side, Adam is happier and you don't have as much murder in your eyes as you did before. You're not gonna try and say this is for survival, right?"

"No. I don't wanna waste this. I can't just walk away without finding out more," Nick admitted to him.

"I want you to know I'm keeping an eye on you. Same principle as daddy making sure a shithead brat isn't dragging his kid into trouble. Keep up the good behavior Nick. Maybe one day you'll get our respect, or don't, but so far you've been going against my expectations and I don't think you'd disappoint now."

This was the warmest the alpha had ever been to him. Expecting frequent kindness wasn't realistic. If he was gonna stay with them he'd earn his keep. Be a change he and they wanted to see.

For now though, Adam kissing at his neck proved too tempting to resist as the two went for their second round and shut the door for the day.
