A 'Mon, Gus
A Clover Guild Story
By Oshawott-Anon

Believe it or not, I'm not actually much of a swimmer. 

I mean, I have nothing against it. It’s just that I so rarely get the opportunity to do so. A couple of relatives had pools for enjoyment during the summer months, and I’d swim at a friend’s place when I’d get invited for a party when I was a kid. But I rarely received invites to parties, and by the time I outgrew childhood pool parties my family had also stopped visiting the relatives with the pool, leaving me with little access to swimming locales than the standard hotel pool, which, let’s be honest, isn’t exactly the most appealing option. Meaning it’s been a hot minute since I took a dip.

So why exactly do I find myself floating in open water, just off the dock of a strange city of trees, fully prepared spend all night floating here? 
Well…

***
*...What the fuck...* 

The phrase was the quickest to enter my mind as I slowly came to. Before even opening my eyes, something felt off. Probably because I'm lying on something substantially less comfortable than my bed, which is where I'm pretty damn sure I left myself last night. And colder. Soon the realization forced its way through my groggy mind: I'm on the ground. 

*Eh, it's too damn early. I'll just lay here for a while, maybe I rolled off my bed in my sle- is that a* breeze*?*

At this my eyes bolted open, to be greeted by the morning sun filtering through a leafy canopy, my grogginess replaced by fully alert confusion. I quickly take in my surroundings: Trees, dirt, some grass... Yup, that's a forest if I've ever seen one. Less pines than I'm used to in my forests, but that's not important right now. This is not my beautiful house, I tell myself. I know I'm not a sleepwalker, I don't live near any forests, and I doubt anyone would want to kidnap me, so why the hell am I all the way out here? I roll to my left to grab the shell that fell off my chest at some point, push myself up, and begin to dust myself off.

Wait...

...Shell...

...That's not my glasses.

I take a minute to study the scallop-like shell in my hand before noticing the hand that's holding it. Or rather, paw. A very white one. I drop the shell, deciding the paw, evidently attached to me, being more worthy of study. I look at one paw, then the other (both very white), move down a light blue torso before settling on two dark blue feet, resting on a ground that I am significantly closer to than I was a mere few hours ago. Huh, strange, if I didn't know any better, I'd say what I've seen strongly resembles that of an Oshawott. Panic sets in after a moment, as I realize these Oshawott features must be *my* features. My concerns about the mixture of foliage long forgotten, I let out a cry as I move to touch my face, naturally smacking myself in the nose. The nose. I feel my nose some more, and *holy fuck the size of this schnoz would put Groucho Marx to shame,* as the image of a clown briefly appears in my mind. Realizing that I've turned into a pokemon has a lot of implications, so I stand there and slightly hyperventilate as I absorb all this information as my blood runs cold. This can't be real. How could such a thing happen? I'm gonna be late to work!

It didn't take long before the answer came to me. Of course! I'm dreaming. A bit less wacky than my usual dreams, but so much more *realistic*. This must be one of them lucid dreams I've heard so much about. Excited to finally try out a lucid dream, I jump and will myself to start flying, which does little more than land me right back on the ground after gaining pitifully little height. Once more the clown appears, this time bearing a little more makeup. Well, if it's a lucid dream I can't control it. Am I really dreaming? What was that trick I read about finding out if you're actually dreaming or not? That's it, try to find a book or a street sign to read; something about whether you can understand the text or not. Unfortunately, there tends to be little in the way of written word in forests, so that'll have to be put on hold. 

With no clear way to determine if I'm dreaming or not, I'll operate as though this is all very real. I've found myself in the pokemon world. I've already got the panicking out of the way, so the next step is finding shelter. I'd rather not end up dead to the elements, or worse, in a pokeball. I'm no survivalist, so this is gonna be a challenge. Minecraft knowledge isn't going to be much use here. 

*Fuck, I wish I paid more attention in the scouts.* But first:

"HELLO? ANYONE OUT HERE?" I cried out, deliberately this time. I was greeted with silence, my high-pitched outburst not even enough to startle any birds from the trees. Or there just weren't any. Great, so not only am I lost, I'm also alone. I guess it's better than hostile company, but I still ought to find my way to somewhere settled, STAT. 

After another look around, I realize that I am in fact standing in the middle of a path through the forest. It looks a bit more well-kept than an animal trail, so it's a sign of civilization; that I'm not alone. That's a good sign. Well, these feet were made for walkin', so I choose a direction and start. A path must lead somewhere, right? Going hobo mode in a town is much better than roughing it in the wilds. As I walk, I wrack my brain for any information that might be useful. Being that I am now a pokemon, hopefully information related to that. Should be easy enough. Oshawott's pure water, right? And at least I know type matchups! For the most part. And the useful berries to look out for are... hm... well fuck, maybe I know less than I though. All the more reason to find civilization. 

...

I would like to formally retract my previous thought about my feet being "made for walkin'." While I am still a mammal, I'm an *aquatic* one, and as such these feet were probably made more for swimming. At this point I've been walking for what feels like hours, but I've probably made far less progress than I think thanks to my new tiny legs. And I still haven't seen hide nor hair of any other living creature! I'd think I've just been walking in circles, if not for the fact the landscape around me has gotten hillier. My feet are getting tired, the day is getting warmer, I'm getting hungry, and there's a cave off to my right that's looking mighty inviting, so I decide to stop off for a rest. 

Upon approaching the cave, I realize it's a fair bit deeper than I thought, so likely more dangerous. The heat's starting to get to me, though. As a water type I could probably use a water move of some kind to cool myself off, but I haven't the slightest idea how I could do that, and I also don't want to risk dehydrating myself that way. It'd be rather embarrassing, so I'll risk the cave. 

I entered deep enough to notice the temperature difference, but not far enough that I'd lose sight of the entrance. I've experienced the absolute darkness of deep caves before, and I know it's incredibly easy to get lost and perish if unprepared. Satisfied with how far in I was, I turned around to face back the way I came, only to find... nothing. The entrance, which I had walked though just moments prior, no longer seems to exist. 

Oh. *Oh no*.

The sudden disappearance of the entrance left several more realizations in its place, which came to me in short order. 

* One: I'm in danger. 

* Two: The fact the entrance disappeared behind me means this is probably a mystery dungeon, which means 

* Three: This is the PMDverse. *Fuck, maybe I should've actually got around to playing the games, because I'm even more clueless about PMD than mainline.* 

* Four: While I won't have to worry about errant pokeballs, I should probably do something about the very angry looking Geodude rapidly approaching my position. 

I'm not much of a fighter, so I froze as I watched the mass of stone and hatred bear down upon me, and ducked at the last second as it hurtled past me toward the former entrance. 

"WOAH, HEY!" Not quite the warm welcome I was wanting. "I didn't mean to intrude, I'm just a bit lost, can you point me toward the exit?"

"GRAAAHHHH"

"I'll take that as a no."

It charged at me again. With it starting much closer, I didn't think I'd have time to duck again. I tensed and covered my head to try to prevent more serious injury, and the Geodude... dropped to the floor. With a small chunk taken out of it. I realized then that I was also holding my shell, and that instead of covering my head I whacked the Geodude with it. Huh, that must be that pokemon instinct. Maybe I'm not in as much trouble as I thought. If this is a mystery dungeon, then the only way out is further in. And I know what I'm looking for at least: stairs! *Congratulations, me, you know the barest minimum*. 

My foe defeated, I continued further in. Still gotta keep my eyes peeled for more angry denizens. With any luck, this guy was just too angry to talk. And can't you find money and items in these dungeons? How hard can it be?

...

"owwwwwww"

I collapsed to the ground in pain. I never thought I'd be happy to see those damn trees again, but here I am just about ready to kiss their bark. 

"*how the hell am I still alive?*"

Mystery dungeons, as it turns out, are not, in fact, easy. They are also inhabited by many Geodudes. While pokeinstincts can help me in a one on one, even they fall short when it's more of a one on 5. I tried diplomacy, but they did not care to listen to reason. I never want to see another Geodude again. 

At least I found some money, though. Cha-ching. And some apples, which were immediately consumed. I choose not to think about the freshness of random apples found in caves.

Once again laying on the ground outside gives me some time to ruminate. I'm glad I'm still alive, for now. That dungeon was a gauntlet. It would've been easier with some help. Speaking of, don't PMD protagonists usually get a partner right off the rip? Why don't I get a partner? As I recall, I was distinctly alone when I woke up here, and every other mon I've seen has tried to kill me on sight. I'm suing Chudsoft for false advertisement as soon as I make it back. And I'm still lost! But now I'm lost on the other side of that ~~hellhole~~ dungeon. 

It's getting pretty late in the day now, probably early afternoon by my estimation, and I'm too sore to walk anywhere. Directionless, partnerless, maidenless, clueless, hopeless. I roll myself to the tree line and attempt to sleep it off.

...

"..r .u. ..ay?"

"grunhhhwha?" *five more minutes, please.*

"Hellooo, you awake?"

There shall be no rest for the weary on this day. I opened my eyes to the concerned face of a short-feathered Sneasel staring down at me. Concerned myself at the proximity, I let out a small cry and scoot myself back, drawing my scalchop.

"WOAH, woah, take it easy, we're not gonna hurt you!"

This voice sounded different than the one that woke me, and the Sneasel's mouth didn't seem to move at all. Huh, she must be an excellent ventriloquist. I relax a bit.

"That's better," the Sneasel said as she helped me up. "What are you doing sleeping on the side of the road like that? It's not very safe, especially so close to a mystery dungeon."

Hmph. Not very safe, indeed. "What do you think I'm trying to sleep off?" I say, still inwardly cringing at how small my voice sounds.

The Sneasel looked me over again, closer.

"Yeah, now that you mention it, you look a bit worse for wear-"

"You mean you went through that dungeon *alone*? Are you hurt? I think we have a spare oran berry somewhere..."

There's that tiny voice again. I'm absolutely flummoxed by where it's coming from until I see something jump from the Sneasel's head down to her rucksack. Or rather, someone, as I now notice that it's a Ribombee that was riding on the Sneasel's head!

The Sneasel must've noticed my confusion. "Oh, that's Booker, my partner. I guess you must not have seen him from down there."

Partner, huh? I am once again reminded I lack one of my own. Still, these two don't seem to hold any ill intent towards me, making them officially the first friendly faces I've seen since I woke up here, and it's nice to not be alone. I relax a bit more. 

"Well, it's a pleasure to meet you. I'm-" My introduction was cut short by a cry from the Sneasel's bag.

"There it is! You mind grabbing it for me?" The voice that I assumed belonged to Booker said.

A large blue berry slowly rose out of the bag. The Sneasel grabbed it and pulled it out, with the Ribombee still hanging on. She dropped the bug back on her head before handing me the berry. 

"Here, eat this, it should make you feel a bit better." 

I stare at the sizeable fruit in my hands before taking a bite. 

"Say," she asked, "what exactly are you doing alone out in this neck of the woods, anyway?"

I swallow and answer. "Well, I'm... new to the area, you could say, and a bit lost. I'd ask the same to you."

Booker answered from atop Sneasel, "Us? We were on our way back to Capim Town when we saw you laying here. Thought we'd check in. And it's a good thing we did, too."

It was Sneasel's turn to talk now. "If you're lost, why don't you come with us?"

"Well, I'd certainly appreciate the company," I answered. "And I'd love to make it back to civilization. Lead on! Thanks for the berry, by the way, I feel much better. What did you say it was again?"

Sneasel gave me a confused look. "It... it's an oran berry. They heal you. Also pretty common, are you sure you're alright?"

I blink. "Yeah, I-I knew that. I'm fine, really."

The three of made towards Capim Town in relative silence. Booker was the first to speak:

"Oh, Oshawott, I don't believe I ever caught your name."

"My name? Of course, I'm-" I paused a moment. I hadn't thought about what I'd tell anyone my name is. I don't want to give these two my real name; anything too human may draw more suspicion to me than I already have. I need an alibi. But what... I'm bad with names... Ah!

"I'm Augustus, but call me Gus." My father once told me that if I wasn't given the name I was, it would've been Augustus. Well, Dad, I hope you're happy.

"Well, it's nice to meet you, Gus," Booker continued. "By the way, I've heard there's a concert of some kind going on at the Blue Claw Inn this evening. Why don't you join us?" He looked at me expectantly.

"A concert, huh?" I mused. Well, that sounds relaxing. Certainly far more so than what I just went through.

"Not just *any* concert, a *Meloetta* concert!" Sneasel interjected. "I've heard her shows are *legendary*!"

I made up my mind. "Sounds fun, I'm in. Not like I have any other plans for the evening."

"Great!" said Booker. "I can get us a seat near the front. But you might want to wash up first, you still look pretty rough."

"And smell rough, too!" Sneasel quickly inserted.

"Sneasel!" Booker admonished.

"What? We were both thinking it."

"Yeah, but I wasn't going to *say* it. No offense. Sorry about her, Gus."

I laughed. "None taken."

Booker continued. "You should be able to go wash yourself off by the docks. We can show you where it is. Show doesn't start until sundown, so you've got some time."

"It would be appreciated, thanks. By the way, who's Meloetta?"

"Oh no," the Sneasel groaned. "Don't tell me *you've* never heard of her, either!"

...

"Well, I guess this is the place."

I stared down at the water below me. I was standing on the Capim Town dock, on the western end of the city where it borders the bay, the towering trees forming Capim Town proper rising behind me.  Despite being told Capim Town was a "city rising out of the forest," it was still nothing at all what I expected. Then again, I'm not sure what I was expecting from a city built and inhabited purely by pokemon. I didn't even notice when we had entered the city until Booker prompted me to look *up*. The entire city was a maze of bridges and buildings within the canopy and slung between the trunks, with only a few stump-like buildings at ground level. Several creeks ran between the trees on their way to the bay. I would've easily gotten lost if not for Sneasel and Booker's directions. I still might get lost making it back to the Inn, but I suppose it'll be easier to navigate with more familiarity. For now, though, I should focus on getting freshened up.

I look again to the water. I had only been to the ocean but twice before, and neither time did I actually swim, so I had never swum in saltwater before. The freshwater creeks draining into the bay means it's probably more brackish than salt in this part, though. Is it even safe to swim in brackish water? Is it even clean? Do I even still know *how* to swim in this body? It *looks* clean, and the presence of the creeks means it's not standing water at least, so no risk of brain eating amoeba. We couldn't gain access to any of the bathhouses (they were too full), but I think otters prefer saltwater any way so I guess this couldn't hurt. 

I've been out in the sun all day, so I assume my body temperature's pretty high at this point. It'd probably be best to start slow so I don't risk putting myself into shock. I should probably start with one foot and work my way from there. That was the plan, at least, but even the best laid among them tend to go to shit when put into action, and I found myself diving in headlong as soon as my foot touched the water. I expected a cold shock when I entered the water, but much to my surprise, there... wasn't? It actually felt comfortable. Quite comfortable, in fact; the mere coolness of the water contrasting the gentle warmth of the sun. The feeling it gave is hard to describe, but it almost feels like home. 

There may not have been any shock to my body, but there was still one to my mind. I hadn't even the time to process this before rising to the surface and starting to swim. Sure, I'm no fishmon (thank God), but I found I still had an instinctive level of agility and comfort in the water that would be the envy of any other mammal. Michael Phelps, eat your heart out! While the excursion was an influx of unexpected joy, entertainment was not my reason for being here. Diving under once more, I rapidly swim to the surface and use my flat tail (A useful thing in the water, that) to propel myself out of the water the to the surface. A move probably more penguin- than otter-like I think to myself, but whatever. It's getting late and I have a show to catch. Clouds are starting to roll in, too; I'll need the remaining sunlight to guide myself to the inn.

...

Well.

That was an eventful evening. 

I had made my way down to the docks again after the events at the Blue Claw Inn and the many things revealed there. To think there would be so many other humans-turned-pokemon there! Even Booker! Who'da thunk. It's no small comfort to know that I'm not alone in my situation, and that there's at least a good dozen in the same boat. Figuring that out was worth the funny looks from the rest of the patrons and the scene it caused. Thank God for that Meowstic, Lliam, though; things probably would've spiraled out of control there if he didn't take charge. But after the ruckus at the Inn, and the meeting between all of us that followed, I was surprised to find myself wanting some alone time. After making plans to form a guild together and getting introductions out of the way, conversation devolved into how we'd spend the rest of the night, and I took my leave. It was all a lot to take in. How ironic that after I had spent most of the day desperately wanting the company of anyone at all, I ditched the group I had the most in common with. So, not knowing where else to go, I once again found myself on the docks. 

I'm too tired to swim, so I guess I can just float around for a bit and think about what to do now.

Needing to unwind after a long day, out on the water... Now would be the perfect time to throw on some music. That Meloetta with her Loreena McKennitt knock off has me wanting for the real thing. I could think of about a dozen different songs right now that I would love to throw on, but alas. Instead, I shall ruminate in silence. *Funny how one of my Mom's favorite songs in the most unexpected of places would be the spark that lit the proverbial fuse....* Only a few minutes of quietude proved too much; the business of the last few hours masked how tired I really was, and I drifted off to sleep...

...

The first night in a new environment rarely leads to a restful sleep in my experience. Even if the bed is the same, the unfamiliar surroundings must trigger some deep-seated instincts for heightened awareness, which usually means waking up in the middle of the night. I guess being an Oshawott doesn't change that. I rolled over to check my phone, and- oh, yeah. Right. I guess I'll just look at the sky instead. And when I did, I was left awestruck.

Clouds had rolled in late afternoon, and they persisted through the night until I fell asleep here. Sometime after I fell asleep, I guess they drifted out, leaving brilliantly clear skies. Now, I've never been much the stargazer, mainly due to light pollution back home. But out here the gentle glow from the sleeping Capim Town is no match, and the stars shine with all their might. Only when I had gone camping in my youth did I have the chance to see, *really* see, the stars, but those brief glimpses paled in comparison to what spread out before me. Thousands of stars, pure and unadulterated, twinkling gently in the open skies. Their brilliance leaves me enraptured, as I float and stare, mouth slightly agape. When I could think again, I remember that I had taken some astronomy classes in college. I doubt I remember much, but the constellations are easy. There should be at least a couple I recognize at this time of year.

But these stars, while beautiful, are not my own. No familiar constellations shone down on me from on high. It started as a small thing in the back of my mind, and like a growing storm built rapidly until it was all I could think about. *Even the stars have changed. The* stars. *Sure, our forms may have changed, and I may not recognize the land around me, but the stars are a constant. If even* they've *taken new form, then-* The events of the last day come flooding back, and in spite of myself, tears started to form, obscuring the stars. *-then just how impossibly far from home are we?* I may be much shorter than I was yesterday, and spent most of the day wondering if I was the only living thing left on this earth, but only now, staring at these unfamiliar stars, did I *truly* feel small and alone.

But I'm not alone. Physically, perhaps. I may not have a partner with which to share my burdens, but there are no less than two dozen others in the guild, in the exact same spot as I, that I can lean on. They all seem to be much more knowledgeable of this world than I, too. Yes, with this many of us together, things will be just fine. 

Newly comforted, I banish the worries. There will be time enough for that later. New questions take the place of less savory ones. *In the games, humans are always brought to the pokeverse for a reason, right? I wonder what ours is? With so many of us, it's gotta be something big.* The stars yielded no answers. Still I watch them, and they seem to shine in a new light; one tinged in sorrow, but full of promise. Promise of new adventures, new experiences and friends made along the way. The lapping of waves on the beach and chirping of what sounded like crickets - *are those pokemon, too?* - form a peaceful background as I drift back to sleep under the gentle shine of the stars.
