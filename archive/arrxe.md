Button Up Blouse
By: Regal

>W-What?" 
>Your voice trembles, full of surprise and the sudden pang of nerves you now feel building in the pit of your stomach. 
>"undo my blouse." 
>The Pantheress repeats, her golden yellow eyes seemingly rooting you to the spot. 
>You swallow, your mouth suddenly dry, though your skin is suddenly moist as you start sweating... did the heating suddenly come to life? are her eyes literally burning a hole into you with the intensity of her stair? either way, you can't help but wonder if she can see the hot flush you can feel all too well. 
>"Your... your blouse?" 
>you manage to stammer out, your tongue oddly sluggish and hesitant to your commands. 
>"That is what I said, is it not?" 
>Carmen fixes you with a smirk, the corner of her dark lips curling upwards in mild amusement at your sudden bashfulness, though her eyes haven't lost even an ounce of their fire. 
>you lick your lips, a pretty useless act all things considered, seeing as your mouth is drier than Gandhi's flip-flop. 
>"C'mon focus, snap out of it you tard, this is it, the moment you've been waiting for, don't make yourself look like an invalid in front of her." 
>Finally, your body seems to be listening to your brain once more, at least for now. you reach up with your hands, and even you can notice how nervous you are, the shaking of your fingers are a clear give away. 
>never the less you manage to reach the top button of her garment, and with all the grace and dexterity of a land bound octopus, you fight your fingers into popping loose her top button. 
>" Yes, one down... many more to go." 
>you think to yourself, your eyes tracing down her front at all the buttons that were left. 
>all the while you can still feel her molten eyes burning into you, that sly smirk still upon her lips, though thankfully she remains silent, not chiding you again. 
>Your shaking hands move down to undo her second button... then her third, your mind regaining better control of it's body with each moment that passes. 
>you glance up at her and make eye contact... for a moment, all thoughts leave your mind, your world becomes little more than those two, bright, predatory orbs and the sound of your own thundering heart in your chest. 
>You're only broken from your trance when you feel her large, warm hands take ahold of yours, surprisingly gentle as they guide your hands down to the next button. 
>you chuckle nervously, managing to drag your gaze from hers and back down to the task at hand, quickly moving down to the next button. 
>you swallow again... you've undone enough now to notice that she isn't waring a bra, and that fact only causes your nervousness to redouble... this was getting serious, and you didn't know if you was up to snuff... so to speak. 
>Her eyes burned into the top of your head, and you didn't know if it was that fact or a deep sense of growing excitement that urged you onwards. 
>*pop... pop... pop...* 
>you continue your job dutifully, working your way down her blouse little silver button by little silver button, until with a quiet rustle, the light blue garment slid away, and... 
>"What's the matter Anon, never seen some kitty titties before?" 
>Carmen's teasing voice reached your brain but were lost in the cacophony of thoughts and feelings currently swirling around in there. 
>Kitty titties were an understatement you feel, as the two mounds revealed to you were both each larger than your head by a good degree. 
>you can't help but stair at the pear, your eyes wide as you take in the full magnitude of the charms before you. 
>her breasts were each covered in that very same glossy, black fur that covered the rest of her body, though up this close, it was much easier to see the subtle differences in the black shading of the pantheress, from here, you could actually make out the rosettes that patterned her cote... that alone would be mesmerizing, a hidden beauty to her already lovely fur. 
>both of her boobs were tipped with a dark grey nipple, full and erect... though from arousal or the sudden cooler air upon them, you couldn't be sure. 
>"I... I uh..." 
>You start to stammer, eyes still fixed on the sight before you. 
>Touch them." 
>She interrupts, breaking what little train of thought you had managed to muster together. 
>"W-What?" 
>"do I really need to repeat myself again, Anon?" 
>she teases, her hands reaching down to grab yours once again. 
>"I said, touch them." 
>before you can do so much as blink, she has placed your hands on her charms, your digits sinking into her soft fur and warm flesh. 
>a breath escapes your lips as you feel her, the gentle curve of her mounds, their waste, the way they shift and mold to your touch. 
>You're rewarded by the sound of Carmen purring, the rumbling of her throat transmitting through her chest and into your hands and forearms. 
>You can't help but let out a slight chuckle, purring... she was purring from your touch... 
>but before you could bask in that fact for too long, a sudden flash of black fur was all the warning you got as the pantheress lunged, grabbing your head between both of her hands before roughly shoving your face into her right tit. 
>As quick as that your world was nothing but darkness and heat as she smothered you within the flesh of her breast. 
>her strong hand held your head firmly against her chest, and it was clear you weren't going anywhere unless she wanted you too. 
>and then you feel it, a stiff nub of flesh rubbing against your lips... it takes you but the briefest of moments to collect your thoughts and realise what it is, and even as her wards reach your ears, you're already letting instinct take over. 
>"C'mon Anon, suckle on mommy's teat." 
>You hear her low chuckle, feel it even through her chest, but you're mind is already lost to your lust. 
>Your lips part, allowing her nipple to pass between them and into your mouth. 
>you suck, your tongue probing against the nub of flesh, tasting her for the first time. 
>At first her flavour was little more than her, and the subtle taste of sweat... and then the warm gush of fluids came. 
>without warning, your mouth was filled with the creamy flavour of her milk, the sudden on rush of liquid surprising you at first, but by now you were lost to your desires, and all higher functioning had been put to the back of your mind for now. 
>you suckled, swallowing down the creamy goodness and yet you suckle harder, wanting nothing more than to do what your pantheress desires of you. 
>"hmm hmm... that's a good boy Anon, drink up, you'll need to be hydrated, can't have you little more than a husk after tonight." 
>once more her words reach your brain, and instead of nerves, your body shivers with excitement, chills running up and down your spine as another mouthful of milk washes down your throat. 
>You shove your face into her tit harder, your hands reaching up and massaging her big mommy milker, fingers digging into her flesh as you work to cokes more of her nectar out. 
>"That's it... now you're getting the idea." 
>she chuckled, her claws gently running down the back of your head and neck, sending yet more shivers down your spine. 
>suddenly, you were pulled from her tit, strands of milk tainted saliva connecting your lips to her perky nipple, a gentle trickle of fluid still leaking from the duct. 
>You look up into those eyes of her once more with half a mind to complain, but you don't get that far. 
>in another quick movement, her face lunges down towards yours, and before you can blink her lips are on yours, rough kitty tongue forcing it's way into your mouth, quickly dominating your much smaller tongue and exploring your throat. 
>the kiss is intense, overwhelming, something you more experience rather than participate in. 
>her purr rattles your skull, the taste of her saliva mixing with the remnants of her milk still on your lips. 
>she closes her eyes, moaning into your mouth. you lose yourself in the moment, your own eyes closing as you let her tongue writhe and explore your mouth. you do your best to give as good as you get, but you're fighting a losing battle. 
>you feel her hands running up and down your arms and back, her strong fingers curling around your bicep with ease. 
>she leans you back, her right hand slowly running up your chest as she somehow deepens the kiss. her claws hook into the collar of your shirt before... 
>with the sound of tearing cloth and the ping of little buttons clacking against the wooden floor, Carmen rips your shirt open with the ease that one might open a pack of chips. 
>the cool air meeting your flushed skin is enough to give you goose bumps and make you shiver. 
>finally the pantheress breaks the kiss, allowing you to catch your breath, only for it to be stolen from you once more as you feel her wet, rough tongue lap across your chest... then stomach... then... 
>she pushes you back against the couch, pinning you down with a single hand while she fiddles with your belt. 
>the tent you were currently pitching in your pants was more than a little obvious, and with the fire in her eyes... it was all too clear what she wanted. 
>Evidently patience wasn't her strong suit, as with a growl that sent a spark of panic through you for a moment, she gave your pants the same treatment as your shirt, the buckle of your belt breaking as the button did likewise. 
>now loose enough, Carmen pulls your pants off in a single fluid motion and tosses them aside to join the scattering of buttons and cloth on the floor. 
>it's no surprise when your boxers meet the same fate, and finally your length... her prize, is free. 
>you let out a soft whimper as you feel her wet nose press into the warm skin of your nut sack, the massive pantheress inhaling your sent with a low rumble of delight. 
>"Oh Anon... you smell good enough to eat." 
>perhaps not the best term to use when her jaws are that close to your closest friends, you think to yourself... but hell if you're going to open your mouth to complain. 
>your skin flushes once again with your aroused excitement, and your already aching length gives a twitch, causing her to giggle. 
>"Well well... someone's eager." 
>she said, her tongue coming into play once again as it slides up the full length of your member. 
>her rough tongue slowly, oh so slowly trails up the underside of your cock all the way to the tip, the rough texture a delightful mix of just intense enough to make you gasp and shiver, but not quite uncomfortable. 
>you look down at her, your eyes wide as you meet her gaze, her pinkish red tongue in stark contrast to the black of her fur and golden of her eyes. 
>she teases your tip, tongue tip swirling around the head of your dick, lips puckering as she gives it a little kiss. 
>and then your entire length disappears. her jaws part, revealing those long, pearly white fangs, glossy with her saliva. 
>for a moment a jolt of fear runs through you, those are some pretty fuckin' big teeth, and if she's not careful, they could... but you quickly find all of your fears brushed aside, replaced instead with mind numbing pleasure as she gives a single, hard suck of your length. 
>you let out a moan, back arching as her tongue once more laps at the underside of your shaft, her soft inner cheek flesh gliding against the sides of your dick as she sucks, swallowing down your pre. 
>"mmm." 
>she purrs, golden eyes closing as she sucks again... and again. 
>you're helpless to do anything but lay there and enjoy the blowjob... for as long as you could. 
>you feel her hand gently massage the underside of your balls, a tingle of pleasure and thrill of fear mixing within you as you ponder just what she could do with those... 
>you let out a breath, toes curling as you feel her claw trace down the sensitive skin of your taint, inching ever closer down... down to your... 
>she pauses just before her claw tip meets your pucker, her eyes opening as she grins at you around your meat in her mouth. 
>with a slurp, she pulls off of your cock and kisses the tip, grinning at you. 
>"Not just yet... I don't think your quite ready for that." 
>before you can reply however, she swallows your cock once more, and it all becomes too much for you. 
>with a shudder, and barely a whimper of warning, your cock throbs within the felines maw, sending shot after shot of your pent up seed to splat against the back of her throat. 
>she moans around your cock, sucking you dry and swallowing every drop of cum you give her. 
>as your mind begins to come down from it's high, she pulls off of you, gently nuzzling your balls while staring up at you. 
>"Oh no Anon... I'm afraid you're gonna have to give a little more than that." 
>this was going to be a long night.
