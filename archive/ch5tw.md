I stand in the bus stop for 20 minutes now, no signs of coming any time soon. I look to the side for any taxis. I don't mind paying extra, I'm late to my meeting as it is.

As if my prayers got answered an empty taxi approaches, I call for it. Th taxi stops in front of me. Just when I try to open the door a pink haired girl barges in and takes the taxi for herself.

>"Sorry my dawg I'm on a hurry. I'll return the favor later......if I feel like it. PEACE!"

The taxi leaves with that weird girl inside. I'm left confused by the turn of events until reality kicks in. I'm still late. Just my luck.

Later that night.

I arrive home, I stomp the door of my shitty apartment. I got in deep problems for arriving late and to make matters worse my boss refuses to pay me all the hours I worked today. Shit job, shit home, shit life. I don't even feel like blaming that strange girl from earlier, only I have the fault for the situation in.

I look down the window. I wonder if a fall from here would kill me.

>"Yooooooo chill dude, let's not do something crazy now" 

A voice coming from behind me scares me, I turn around and see it's that girl. How did she got in?!

>"Look I don't want you adding more job to me so let's stay away from that window and go to a nice place. I'll pay cause I'm just that nice y'know"

What is with her? is she legit dumb or can't she read the room? I tell her to get out of my home and I won't call the police.

>"Damn you're such a fucking bitch you know that. I just wanted to be nice to you. Whatever, rot in here for all I care"

The pink haired girl kicks one of my chairs in anger and walks straight to the door. Before she leaves, she glances at me one last time. 

>"........ARGHHHH FINE! I'm sorry, is that what you want me to say? I'm a fucking mess, just like you. I can't even repay a favor."

The girl looks down, almost like she is about to cry. The two of us stand there in silence, the situation has gotten too awkward for both.

>"It's fine I mean I'm fine. Don't look at me like that, it pisses me off. You can forget about me. Bye"

She tries to close the door and leave. I stop her and say the only words I should have said from the start.

>"There is this dumb superhero movie I wanted to watch. Do you want to go with me?"

The girl stands there confused by my words, after a couple of seconds she laughs and wipes her face, trying to cover the tears.

>"You are such a dumbass. Inviting the grim reaper to watch bad movies, you have balls. I like it. You can call me Calli by the way"

We both depart and leave our problems behind as well. I still don't know what she meant by grim reaper. It doesn't matter. It makes the story more memorable, that was the day I knew a grim reaper called Calli. Yeah it has a nice ring to it. Hopefully we can make more stories like that.
