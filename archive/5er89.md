#Trading Overview
***
Using the same data, this breaks down all ‘active’ trading profits into categories and sorts players by total trading profits from last week.
‘Trading Income’ is the basic difference between the buy and sell price of coins, ‘Trading Taxes’ are losses from buy/sell taxes in the two matching transactions. Taxes differ based on multicoin count. ‘Trading Profits’ is simply income minus taxes.
‘Invested Amount’ is the amount of money converted into coins by unmatched buys. ‘Investment Income’ composes of ‘Invested Profit’ plus ‘Investment Taxes’, it’s highlighted for consistency. ‘Investment Taxes’ are losses due to taxes associated with those transactions. In theory, 4.5% is the minimal investment taxes/invested amount ratio, while 45% is the maximal ratio, representing only 1x buys or only 10x buys. ‘Invested Profit’ is the difference between the price the coin was purchased at and its average price, minus taxes; you can consider it a forced sell of every coin bought during the week at the average price. Oshicoiners and high-ranked players, respectively, thrust themselves into buying coins above their average prices if they want to convert liquid into coins for long-term dividend profits.
As you can see, trading differentiates the players a lot. While total income was correlated mainly with rank, especially high on the leaderboard, trading easily differentiates between players who are close to one another.
