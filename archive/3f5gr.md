Ranch hand Anon by /bara/hmoma/ writefrien

Stallions embarrassed about how they can't last longer that 10 seconds

Cute
>Anon is the new ranch hand working in a prestigious stable
>Assigned to handle and aid the stallions specifically
>Horses of all breeds and vocations, from pretty little Arabians to big tough Shires
>Gets mercilessly flirted with from day one, turns out being hired in spring meant dealing with their rutting period
>The first incident occurred with Dale, an American paint horse.
>Paint horses are "stock" breeds, meaning he comes from a long line of hard workers and laborers, this naturally put him at odds with the more prestigious breeds.
>He was certainly prejudiced, insisting that race horses were all "fast little fillies" who were too quick both on and off the racing track
>As for shires, he tapped his skull, smirking as he suggested they were more fur than brains.
>Like him or not, he was your first customer, and he seemed to be due a full brushing and a shoe replacement.
>He was surprisingly helpful, keeping still and casually handing you your tools as you worked on his hooves
>It was during the brushing session that things got...quiet
>The talkative horse stopped yammering on about how his great grandpappy built the very barn they were standing in back in eighteen aught seven (that didn't sound right)
>He seemed pretty clammed up actually, and his breathing was a little heavy
>He might be in pain with the new shoes and trying to tough it out, which was unacceptable.
>He had his back turned to you, letting you comb his mane to get the leaves and twigs out
>You decided to just ask, the last thing you needed was a leg injury, and this guy seemed like the type to let his ego get the better of him and put on a brave face
>Leaning in close you whispered if he was feeling okay
>He jumped a little, ear flicking at your sudden closeness
>"F-FINE! I'm just peachy! Work away!"
>You sighed
>And then immediately grabbed his broad shoulders before swinging him around to face you
>Ah, there was the problem
>Dale was sporting one hell of a stiffy, fit to burst
>Rightfully mortified, the equine quickly tried to cover up his shame, to little effect considering that it was a literal horsecock
>A horse in rut was easily excitable, and you weren't dumb, like all the other guys his brain was fogged by rut, a stray breeze would have had him popping a boner
>"It's not what it looks like! I-it's just you have really warm hands and you kind of smell like flowers and...oh god..."
>He was red as a beet
>He was squirming under your gaze as you thought of what to do
>No way that monster was going down any time soon, but you had shit to do!
>But you also couldn't just leave him with dirty fur...
>You remembered hearing about a "last resort" move for situations like this. Apparently it was horse racing's worst kept secret for when a stallion was "distracted" right before a run
>You produced a tub of coconut fur oil, used by the show horses to keep their coats shiny
>Spreading a liberal dollop between your palms, you lubed your hands up nicely.
>Without missing a beat, you closed the gap between yourself and the still stammering work horse, pinning him to the wall
>"What're y-" a finger to his lips and a quiet shush stopped him from interfering as you moved your hand downwards
>You casually gripped his throbbing cock, making him jump a little
>One hand slowly applied lube to his member, while the other went to his ample butt
>You began teasing his hole a little, tracing circles with your finger
>He looked absolutely scandalized that you were molesting him like this, but that didn't stop you
>He looked ready to protest, but you intercepted
>"Easy big fella, you're in rut, and I'm here to take care of you"
>you gave his flared cock an appreciative sqeeze "Just relax and enjoy yourself"
>Well lubed with his own pre and the oil, you tightened your grip, beating him off properly, whispering praise and massaging his hole as well
>What felt like seconds later his, legs started wobbling like crazy
>"W-wait I'm gonna-"
>Of course he didn't want to cum straight away, but time was of the essence here
>You kept it up, "c'mon, just let it aaaaall out~"
>"nngh, FUCK!"
>...Annnd boom goes the dynamite
>The horse bucked his hips forward, shooting thick ropey loads of hot stallion cum all over the stall's wall
>It took him longer to finish than it did to get him fully hard.
>You gave him an appreciative pat on the head
>"Good boy, now sit, I need to finish getting the dust off of your back."
>He was too stunned to speak as you plopped him back into the chair and went right back to work
>Eventually he turned his head over to the frankly ludicrous amount of cum all over the wall
>"Umm"
>Ah, it probably stunk of sex to his sensitive nose right now, luckily you two were alone
>"Don't worry about that, I'll clean it once we're done, now keep your head straight I need to-"
>He huffed indignantly "THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE HERE! WHY'D YOU TOUCH ME LIKE THAT!?"
>What a drama queen "I can't rightfully clean you when you're popping a stiffy the size of a baguette Dale, jeez..."
>You went on to explain that while it isn't implicit, section 24-C of your contract did state that you had to have the horses ready for work "by any means necessary"
>He was once again stunned into silence by your interpretation of that rule, he mustn't have been cleaned regularly enough, poor thing.
>Eventually you had gotten him sparkling clean, and a quick bucketful of water had removed all evidence of his "happy ending"
>He was STILL blushing as he got dressed, looking at you uncomfortably as he slipped his jeans back on.
>"Y-You're not gonna tell anyone right?".
>You smirked at him "What, that I had to beat you off or that you didn't last more than thirty seconds?"
>If looks could kill, you'd be a pile of ash on the floor right now
>Snide comments aside, you eventually convinced him that your lips were sealed, if only he knew that most stallions you work with don't make it past 20 seconds.
