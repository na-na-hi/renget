-> ==BEFORE YOU INTERACT. .==<-
-> we use kys/die humor and are pretty much mentally ill
sometimes some of us use slurs if not comfortable tell us 
not sharing triggers, if u have some pls tell
we usually don't use tonetags
we __are__ really mean/chaotic at first, and telling tone isn't that hard for us
so don't take things for what we *say* __seriously__ <-
