#### Graphics Class Design
>*“Functional, durable, beautiful.”* —Vitruvius

*"The purpose of the graphics chapters is dual: we want to provide useful tools for displaying information, but we also use the family of graphical interface classes to illustrate general design and implementation techniques. In particular, this chapter presents some ideas of interface design and the notion of inheritance. Along the way, we have to take a slight detour to examine the language features that most directly support object- oriented programming: class derivation, virtual functions, and access control. We don’t believe that design can be discussed in isolation from use and implementation, so our discussion of design is rather concrete. Maybe you’d better think of this chapter as “Graphics Class Design and Implementation.” "*
