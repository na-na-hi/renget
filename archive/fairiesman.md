#A fae-rly accurate tale

 Once upon a time in a land far far away, there lived a grimmsnarl in an enchanted forest. He was not like any other grimmsnarl, for this one was taller than even the tallest of pokemons, capable of reaching the treetops with his arms. He lived peacefully with the other pokemon of the forest, for he was their guardian, driving away any outsider that possed a threat to their home.

 The hatterene that lived outside the forest was very jealous of the peaceful & abundant life that everyone else had, & with her wicked magic she casted a spell upon the grimmsnarl, a sickness that would leave him weakened, a spell so strong that it would've killed any other pokemon if they would've contracted it.

 But the witch casted the spell wrong, & instead of weakening him, it just gave him incredible amounts of pain throughout his body. The grimmsnarl, confused & in pain, asked for the forest's residents for help, but no matter what they brought or did, they were not capable of curing his ailment. Furious, the grimmsnarl lashed out at anything & anyone in front of him, leaving a wake of destruction on his path, & decided to isolate himself in a cave.

 The dwellers of the forest, not wanting to give up to help the pokemon that gave so much for them, left in search of something, someone that would be able to get rid of the grimmsnarl's illness.

 Years passed, until a whimsicott caught wind of the tale of the pained giant residing on a cave in a fantastical forest, & wanting to help, she ventured out to search for him.

 When the whimsicott arrived at the forest, she found the inhabitants were having mixed feelings about the situation: Some were still holding on to hope, begging her to try & cure their collosal friend, others had already lost hope, & were already making plans to leave their home once & for all.

 Some of the grimmsnarl's closest friends guided the whimsicott to the place their friend resided in, & warned her about the risk she's taking with coming so close to the grimmsnarl's layer, before leaving.

 The whimsicott stood behind the massive opening to the cave, & called for the grimmsnarl inside, beconing him to come out for her to cure him.

 "Cure me?" a booming voice reververated against the cave's walls **"CURE ME?!"** Even with the massive opening of the cavern, the creature that came out of it had to bend itself over to fit through. The grimmsnarl had grew even more while in his dark confinement, now it's arms & legs being as thick as the oldest of the trees in his forest, he was now considerably taller than when he had entered, towering over anything & anyone, specially the whimsicott in front of him, that looked like a rattata in comparasion.

 With a loud boom he bent over her, now his face being in front of what he considered to be an intruder to his domain **"YOU plan to cure me, when *no one* after all these years could? What makes you think YOU are special?!**

 The grimmsnarl hadn't noticed, but being so close to her, it made whimsicott realize something, she could see the cause of his pain.

 What the hatterene had casted wasn't a normal infection, or a move or a status, it went deeper than that, all the way into the grimmsnarl's very own being. What the witch had done is making the gentle giant realize how alone he truly was, & with her magic she broke his feeble heart.

 Whimsicott could see the rage in the grimmsnarl's eyes, but also the pain, the sadness that he went through, it all clicked on her head.

 She stepped foward, surprising the grimmsnarl, & said "This..." as she leaned foward & gave him a true love's kiss. Their aura's became one for a split of a second, & with her love she healed his broken heart.

 In a moment, grimmsnarl felt all his pain, all his sadness, all his worries & anger leave him, & he fell in love with her too.

 That day, all of the forest was filled with happiness & celebration, as they had regained their protector after all that time, & with the love of his life by his side, they would never have to worry about him becoming sick again. After a year they had a son, a big & strong boy, & they lived happily-

 \*shuffle\* \*shuffle\*

 I looked behind me, closing the book quickly. I hold my breath as I look for the origin of the noise.

*\*zzzzz\**

 Oh, it must've been lady Weezil moving in her sleep again, I take a breath as I try to calm myself down. As I look at the sky & notice the rising sun above the horizon I realize that I too should go to sleep, but the book's not finished, & I *have* to finish it, as I doubt that I will get any more free time from here on out now that lady Weezil found the human's secret hideout.
 But... I *could* finish it right now, if you didn't know the story it would look like your typical happily ever after, this story could have a good ending.

 No, this isn't some fantasy story, this is a biography that I want to pass off as a fairy tale, but I can't lie no more. With pencil in hand, I press it against the paper once more.

 ~~happily~~ happy for even more years.

 But, the witch's spell had unforseen consequences on the couple. As the years passed, they noticed something was wrong with their son.

 Unlike any other impidimp, he was cautious, fearful even, he didn't like to play with others of his age, & when he evolved it became worse.

 Taking from his parent, Morgel was twice as tall as any regular morgrem, & he didn't like it, it felt like everyone was watching him, he felt their judgemental gaze upon him, & instead of walking tall & proud like his dad did, he slouched & crawled everywhere in a pathetic attempt of looking small & uninteresting.

 His Mom & dad were understanding of their son, & always tried to make him feel comfortable with who he was.

 One day, a dragonite showed up to the forest, massive in size, he landed on a clearing near where whimsicott & her kid was.

 He demanded ownership of the forest, & the whimsicott protes-

 *\*sighh\**

 I lay the book & pencil on the ground, & start taking breaths as I rub my face.

 C'mon focus, focus. Just be done with this, feel sad later, just be done with this.

 After I feel myself calm down, I pick up my things again.

---

 ~~He demanded ownership of the forest, & the whimsicott protes-~~ Before she can say something, the dragonite launches themselves on top of her, & picks her up. Everyone else was already running away or screaming, except his son, frozen in place, he watched as the monster teared her mother apart in front of him.

---

*\*sniff\* \*snifff\**

---

 The screams alerted the grimmsnarl, as he came running to the place with loud & furious steps, but it was already too late.

 The dragonite squared up with the giant, & they engaged in battle.

 But the grimmsnarl was already growing old, his strenght lessening even before he was casted that curse all those years ago. Time was taking it's toll, as the sounds of bones breaking & cries of pain filled the battlefield.

 With a final strike the dragonite slayed the forest's gigantic guardian, & roared over the dead body of who was once a father. He walked up to Morgel, & reached out a paw for him.

---

 A sudden chilly breeze passes over me, prophetic in nature it halted my writting.

 I look over to lady Weezil, & see her still laying besides me, I make sure to cover her with a little bit more of my hair. Even if she's an ice type, I don't want her to sleep uncomfortable.

---

 Freezing, chilling, nail biting cold runs deep in my core, I hear a roar above me, & a bigger roar above that one, drawning the first until there's no more sounds left but the wind blowing past my body.

 When it stops, I look up, the beast, imposing in nature, trapped between frozen walls, & behind it, the culprit, my saviour.

 She's exhausted, ripping icicles out of the corners of her mouth, but she quickly hides it when she notices me. She takes a glance over me, & she looks frustrated. She turns & starts walking away.

 It felt like an eternity, until someone came back, I was quickly surrounded by other pokemon, & they all shared a sad expression.

 I understood when I looked at the bodies of my mother & father.

-> **A WEEK LATER** <-

 A week, a whole week it took me to bring myself to my parent's graves. I was sad, but most of all, I was frustrated with myself, with how I just stood there, with how I did nothing, it should've been me, not them.

 I hear whispering from behind me, a pair of ribombee laying low between blades of grass *"Who will protect the forest now?"*

 The forest, even when he was sick no one dared to come here, my father's presence deterred most back then. If word got out of his, death.
 What will happen? What will they do? What can *I* do?

 Then I remember, that weavile, how they saved my life. If they could defeat that dragonite...

 I had a plan: Convince them to come back & become the new guardian of the enchanted foest. But first I had to find them.

 After asking around & preparing myself, I was ready to leave, to go out & find them. I already said goodbye to everyone, I had everything I could need in my bag, I pomised them to find them a new guardian, so why did I still doubt myself?

 At the edge of the forest, I took my first upright steps in a long time, & started walking away from my home, but not forever, I had a promise to uphold.

-> The end. ->

 I let the pencil fall from my hand, it rolls inside the book, & I close it. After putting them in my bag, I slowly lay besides lady Weezil, taking extra care not to make a sound. As I lay there, I think about the last lines of my book.
 How dumb that was, it's not her job to become the forest's guardian.
 It's mine.
