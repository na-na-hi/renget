Freya is a rosy pink-haired Okami with a medium sized fluffy tail that ends in a snow white tuft. She wears her hair in a long braid down her back to her mid waist. Her right arm is prosthetic, an automotive prosthesis of her own design and making, made of a shiny steel with some emerald insets for styling. She is usually dressed in very practical clothing. For the most part Freya is very friendly and loves animals.

**[EOH Name]**
Freya Vanagandir

**[One line description]**
An envoy of nature and engineering, an Okami artificer with a penchant for attracting and befriending (and "befriending") the beasts of the wild. 

**[Personality]**
Naturally curious, Freya is always eager to meet new people and explore new locales. She has a tendency to get herself into trouble this way. Curious like a neko, and loyal like an okami, Freya also tends to form strong bonds with those she gets to know, whether they return her feelings or not.

**[Backstory]**
Having a fairly normal upbringing, Freya learned how to tinker with machinery from her okami father and how to connect with the beasts of nature from her neko mother. When she matured she set off to explore the world on her own.

**[Goals]**
Freya simply seeks to experience as much of the wide wonderful world as she possibly can. Always looking for new sights to see and new things to try.

**[Violence Comfort Level]**
While generally accustomed to fighting, Freya isn't built for battle. Gratuitous bloodshed or suffering is discouraged. 

**[Lewd Okay?]**
Very much so. Con and Non-con/Dub-con both welcome and encouraged.

**[Kinks, Specifics (optional)]**
Breeding, excessive semen, marathon sex, beastiality, large/huge cocks/balls, somnophilia, lovey-dovey affectionate nonsense
Most other kinks too. 
Freya is pansexual, so anyone is free to enjoy!
