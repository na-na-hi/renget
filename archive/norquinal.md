# Norquinal's Bots

###What's a Recommended Platform?
It's somewhat self-explanatory, but the recommended platform delineates which AI service/model I feel is best at capturing the character's personality and behavior on a general basis. I will put "Either" if feel that all platforms are comparable. I might even include little explanations for why I make certain ratings. Individual mileage may vary, of course. Ratings aren't absolute and are subject to change.

### Suggestions
I enjoyed making bots. I don't enjoy it as much as I used to, but if you have any ideas for a bot you think would be cool, or how I could improve a bot, or otherwise any comments or feedback, I'm always open to hearing them. You can send suggestions to [this jotform](https://form.jotform.com/231595952077062).
