hello. im here to expose a few of my ex friends whom i have been acquaintanced with for a few months now. those people are [tala](https://rentry.org/starrysongstress) [ell](https://www.patreon.com/user?u=71973652) and [akito/ivy/rei](https://rentry.co/shiinonome). you may know those people from a game called "ponytown". they are extremely problematic and have made numerous threats to airbomb and bomb my house. you may think that's funny, but i promise you it's literally traumatizing. dont get me started on tala who has my literal address and went to my house and started doing toilet paper pranks! my house was built with wood and leaves so it broke and now im homeless. then the other day ell started sending me 67 boxes of pizza thats 5 week old and with maggots and mold and expired coke cans!! and now im in the hospital. do you know how traumatizing that is? its NOT funny and no one should go through this. rei .. im fine with rei, but she is unbelievably goofy and gay and likes enstars and pjsk EWW and friends with those 2, and supports their actions. this isnt a laughing matter, and if you actually believe this is funny, then i suggest getting professional help. these people deserved to be exposed. i am not tolerating this and neither should you. if you come across them, please block them immediately!!
