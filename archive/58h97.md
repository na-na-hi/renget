El dorado protector - Monster Hunter World Greentext by anon

>The New Wolrd is vast, and full of ressources, however, finding these ressources with other means than just stumbling on them is hard, especially considering the wild life makes the task dangerous
>So instead of just sending workers to their doom blind, the guild hired people of your field from the Old World to help the mapping of the regions, your field in particular was metals and crystal formations, a chronicaly needed group of ressources for weapons, tools, houses and so much more!
>As the guild sent you off to investigate mineral deposits in the soil, you surely didn't expect the gravity the simple tour would take
>You were strolling alongside the banks of water in the new world
>Tasked with keeping extracts with the locations of the metals known on the vials you'd use to collect the minerals and sediments so the guild cartographers and geologists could map It for ressource gatherers
>You had just stumbled on what appeared to be little grains of metalic corn when It hit you that the new world may have more where that came from
>You'd prick at the surface, lodging an old pickaxe into the rock above to crack what's under
>That decision proved Itself useful, the gold was now sticking out, you felt some pride in your work when noting the size of the nugget
>Both hands on the nugget, you pulled with your might, harder yet harder until a creaky breaking sound made Itself known
>The floor under you also gave in as It was a single peice of rock in the midst of the bank of running water
>Your dodging proved useless, getting your waist stuck in the current by lowering yourself only got you sucked in the hole faster with how heavy your copper armor was
>Your body had a rough time on the fall but had no damage from the height as you kept hitting wall surfaces in your unwanted slide ride
>Water poors into the earthly cavity, and you are left with a now rustier armor, sitting in the middle of nowhere with your ingot of a gold nugget, with a path out now too slippery to get through again
>You take in that your surroundings are very dim, the sounds of brushing materials in the cavernous crevace make you uneasy
>You bag up all that could have fallen including your lucky cursed nugget
>Sighing at the inconvenience you stare at the light and water, that's then you feel the weight of crushing metal hit your helm and side in a painful double attack
>If that wasn't enough, you feel a sort of needly arrow pass through your arm, you're being sedated, and not in a fun manner


>Barely you can assess your surroundings as little shining beings fill your view
>As if the nugget you found had a family for a minute
>All attempts at communicating made you sound drunk, and soon you fall asleep for good, still reeling from the resonant shock your head took
>You struggle in your sleep, feeling the ground under you change and become rougher yet hotter as your body is pulled through what you assume is an underground area
>As you woke up you then learnt the identities of your tiny aggressors, a rather odd group of Gajalakas, covered from head mask to paw with gold at that
>If the sight didn't numb you from your nugget discovery you could still find hilarity in watching said Gajalakas be disappointed you didn't carry anything of actual value for them
>All the minerals that may have been interesting are in infinitly small quantities in odd glass vials with paper scribbles attached on them, nothing they could use, the pickaxe is old and will break soon, the gold nugget? There's gold everywhere here, why care?
>You felt like a pang of sadness hit you when looking at their exasperated gestures, but then you remember you don't even know where you are and is tied to a pole
>A Gajalaka slowly makes Its way up to you, giving you back your bag as It had the kindness to fill It back up with your "useless" inventory contents It re-attached the bag back on your armor
>After exchanging looks, and feeling very watched as It looked you up and down 
>It seems to have found new vigor as It ran off into the rocky red and yellow distance as if needing to talk to someone
>The rest of the group looks over to you, and after their comrade comes back and gestures something, begins lifting the pole up with you still tied on It
>You do not like that chain of events and you do not trust It
>You can't even voice a complaint, It seems they glued your mouth shut from inside with old royal extracts from a beehive, truly a regal day, they reigned in gold and honey, all you need now is milk and wine
>Your pole is set back into the ground after a while, but done so in a room with a vast range of golden decorations, in fact It looked like a palace's dining room with the massive golden structures resembling lights above and chandeliers
>You tilt your head back to gawk at the sight, maybe they just wanted to show you their world? 
>That's when they all started bowing behind your pole
>Maybe they wanted you to meet their chieftain?
>In a sense, you were correct, they did want their chief to look at you
>However you did not anticipate that their chief was not a lynian... 
>Suddenly you felt closer to a sacrifice than a hostage of circumstances which wasn't already much better
>From around the central pillar started the lazy but distinguished stroll of a massive creature, the reflective properties of It's wings... Oh hold on It's a coat, now It blinded you more than the gold covered Gajalakas ever could before too
>You'd have maybe screamed if It wasn't for the honey like material in your mouth keeping It shut and how great the sight of the unknown creature was even when she got a bit too close to your taste
>Their chief was now identified as a Queen, one with a knack for both fashion and metal working as It became obvious
>She was enormous, and gifted with a coat of literal molted gold, addorned her head was with a crowning pair of horns and even more gold stuck to It, the colors of It reminded you of a rainbow colored pearl, her body lined Itself with even more of the prized minerals making her shine in all angles possible
>Once stationed in front of you, she sat herself partially like a diva as if she was a roman emperor having a guest in the house
>You're the scholar here, you should be studying this specimen and not the opposite, yet It felt like she was more interested in the sight of you then you in the sight of her
>She brought a claw near your form, proding at the skin of your face, surprised at the elasticity and lack of fur or hard shell parts
>The odd protruding little mound we'd call nose was funny to her
>She carressed a spot on your face with delicate claws before studying other body parts including where your armor would have Its joints, where It was leaving the underside of the copper more exposed with your clothes and skin right under
>She took care of understanding the multiple layers, and began scratching at the metal armor 
>She inspected the residue, which reminded you that's the task you've been robbed of by the incident
>She started considering the copper was not part of your body like a neopteron's exoskeleton and unlike that, It was likely safe to remove, the lack of biological materials on the residue tells her there's no nerves attached to the plates so at least you'd not feel pain from further research
>You think you hear a name being uttered by one of her loyal servants while It answered a companion's question
>Something around the lines of Kulve Taroth, so you assume this draconic diva is bestowed this name
>When she retracted, you did an effort to attempt bowing despite your current tied up nature, she bows her head down in response
>You think she appreciated the politeness as she brought a claw at your rope covered sides and made the tightness cease with a slow swoop
>Now that you were lowered from your pole, two Gajalakas now held their weapons at your sides in case you did anything fishy with the newfound freedom you were given
>You didn't care much as you had the displeasure of having one of these blades hit you in the head before and instead opted to get closer to the Queen's curious gaze
>You stood still, trying the waters to see if she did allow for It, and that she did as motioned by her claw
>The guard Gajalakas retreated a bit to give you two greater space
>The golden beast simply supported herself better to begin examining you again, this time, sampling peices of equipements off
>Once she let your bags and tools go, she brings her claw to the supports of your armor and undid them in a well sliced slash
>Slowly she undos your crustacean wannabe costume of copper, taking care of keeping the peices near her, inspecting if your weird skin, aka your clothes or actual skin was harmed in the process
>The clothes being made of cotton, leather and wool made her consider that It could be a living part of you but Gajalakas did teach her that was likely not the case as one motioned at Its own garnements to tug at them showing both layers were not connected
>This close study she does lets you also see that Kulve's gold coat makeup is comprised of copper too which you haven't seen at all in the underground Queen's dominion
>Once she removes enough copper plates she finds the wounds from both the fall and forced sedation, she cuts up the clothes that would block her care thanks to the Gajalakan confirmation that no, It wasn't flaying you to do that
>She then cocks her head closer to you and you keep your calm as she lets her tongue slide accross your bruised skin and reddened areas
>Your blue spots worry you a little but since you didn't need to move much and It felt numb you'd assume It'd heal up normally with time
>For a monster that lives in a volcanic area, the treatment felt refreshing, the tongue was slightly cooler than the room you were in, and the touch heated only for a moment before feeling fresh, reddened areas would return to their original colors fast
>Your wounds didn't burn further once licked, you figure that's her pardon for the rough introduction to her world
>She carresses the smooth of sides, teeth occasionally brushing alongside your skin, nearly feeling like a soft carress but not as soft as her actual carresses as she let a hand run slowly with a pinprick of force on your bruised temples, you closed your eyes at the sensation, she was making the headaches go away, and when you felt her breath on your face you didn't squirm, she brushed the wound away.
>Bruises now gone and red spots gently taken care of only your deeper bluish hurts remained, these were helped but couldn't be magically cured as your body needs to also do the work, she did give extra there for the best of chances
>You felt her be still and opened your eyes again, her eyes asked a question as her hand layed against your head, and when the meaning of the question hit you, you nodded and tried stiffening yourself to be more at her level
>You felt the heat radiated off her be transfered to her tongue, It glew orangish tones of reddish golds as It began making the hardened honey mixture melt, the tongue protruded slightly into your mouth, caring not to burn your skin by not touching It, piercing away at the block that prevented your speech
>The tongue slowly snaked Its way in and out as the hardened resin like material faded progressively
>It was also keeping the honey clot away from falling in your throat as she took the opportunity to taste It too for herself, honey shouldn't be wasted after all, not royal extracts at that. 
>It left a sweet taste in your mouth as It melted away, finally letting you breath with your mouth again, the leftovers probably cured any throat related illnesses you could have had
>Your first reaction was an audible "Thank you" after a large breath of air she chuckled after noting you blushed at her ministrations and that detail made you blush even more from embarrassement
>You had assumed the heat on your face was simply from the heat of the area but she could see clear as day that your blood rushed to your face making you look like a regular Gajalaka mask, you're sure you heard one laugh too
>She used a hand to remove the copper helm she had left and turned to her side in front of you
>A guard holds your arm and tugs It back, you obey, feeling this wasn't anger but concern, and now with the heat of the room tripling in seconds you're sure of that, your armor is in her front, as her underside is now heating up considerably, turning into an open air foundry
>Her coat gets softer and shinier as It enters different fusion stages and your armor is now being rubbed against the firey scales of the Queen by her own care
>She looked at your surprised expression with amusement as she moved the now unusable armor alongside her crest and heating scales slowly in soft circular motions until... It was over. The extreme heat receded in seconds and now what appears to be a fountain of copper waters has formed. 
>A few lynians readied their blades and used them as shovels to scoop up the now molten materials, one even gave you their's so you could participate
>You happily did so and tried following the lynian cues to know what you're doing, as you remove the residual copper from her scales and the ground, she turns again
>Now you understand she gave you the honor to alongside her subjects help the making of her coat
>The still fusing materials gave you inspiration, and so you started doing the melding with care to make geometrical emblems stand out, including the one of butterfly wings on the coat, the Gajalakas took notice and approved of the inspiration, proceeding to make smaller ones near your drawings,
>Another completed with dotted lines to make the pattern feel more regal and once you had completed the tasks Kulve allowed you all to unclimb her if needed,
>You had found yourself nestled between her neck and paw as she had aided you getting up there in the first place. 
>She took a glance at your work and struck a pose to signifiy her approval, the tribal lynians cheered in their own manner and you clapped alongside their weird dances that despite being of happiness you couldn't help but wonder if hostile with the speed and janky motions they did. 
>That's when you felt her head get on your shoulder and you embraced the kind embrace yourself, 
>You did feel a guard get jealous of the attention and pinching your leg but they knew they could live their whole life at her side and you'd only be here a day 
>It calmed their anger almost as immediately as the little hit in the elbow their friend did to them to get them to stop
>In the hug you voiced who you were and what you were doing, and what you'd like to do, mainly go back home
>She understood the concerns and took note of your status as she broke a rock on the side and gave you a metal you had not collected before, motioning to the east as Its provenance to help your task, and proposing you'd guided by her subjects to an exit they keep secret
>She then did a motion you assume was for her subjects as you are now held up by the group like a rockstar to bring you back to the surface, 
>A better method of locomotion compared to the pole in your opinion
>As you are about to leave through the secret opening, you two exchange gazes and you make the note not only to come back but never tell the guild about her,
>You know their method of study is "send a hunter then ask questions later" which scared you for the well being of this gold filled Kingdom. If the many races of this world shared something outside of a love for hunting It was greed, and you were not too reassured at the idea of this secret going live. 



>Eventually that did happen, someone must've tipped them of their discovery, and you made sure to visit after the hunt since you heard they did not slay her.
>However you were not happy about the sight, her magnificent coat was now torn, her royal set of Horns broken off and her subjects had a lot more blood on their blades than before alongside marks of fighting and scratching on their masks.
>You were let in without question, they knew It wasn't you that was responsible, and led you to their Queen,
>A hunting party had formed for the quest, they succeeded and left, their story was told everywhere, and the golden kingdom now had gold diggers trespassing illegally and the guild could not catch them all leading to the Gajalakas getting their paws dirty. 
>You weren't surprised one bit. 
>You had brought some healing items out of a dawning feeling the guild did not play nice and you were confirmed in your fears
>She looked scared but mostly felt unprepared for the assault, you went up to embrace her and she accepted the somewhat unmannered welcome with open arms, 
>She laid against the ground to give you access to wherever you'd need to be, she knew you were a scholar since last time and thus trusted your medical knowledge to aid her
>You took care of applying healing potion mixtures where her horns were to help their growth again, even addorning the sides of the harshly broken stumps with shining metals, you polished the broken top fragments so they wouldn't hurt when regrowing
>Bandaging multiple areas of her body using cobwebs and plants that she helped burn into mush while her subjects followed some potion and boost recipes was not easy but was needed
>The Gajalakas were having their own little kitchen moment with the treatments, surely you wouldn't mind one becoming a renowned chef in a restaurant someday with their precision and patience in concoction making
>Maybe teach them to make humous someday... 
>Kulve Taroth then presented you her underside again, and you gasped at the sheer damage the hunters did and the presence of chipings in the gold everywhere,
>Normally these are minimal as the crabs eat the golden chips but not even the crabs were spared especially not by greedy poachers 
>That and Gajalaka blades were not meant for this task either so they couldn't help It much, 
>You took It upon yourself to trim down imperfections using your mining tools and you patched up wounds left from the battle,
>Hearing her soft breathing, pained noises each time you'd pass over a wound and the mournful meows and grunts of her subjects still reeling from fights left you feeling for her
>After doing your best at her side, and her subjects now knowing how to help their Queen better you were allowed to stay for the night as to not alert the guild of your whereabouts,
>You'd say you were hiking on an expedition to find the placements of mineral veins through the lands
>Kulve gave you rare minerals she had attracted as a way of prooving you ventured far beyond the normal roads as a way to justify the time you took
>She also gave and intel on where to find more, you knew Troverians that would love to mine these for sure
>Thanks to her you mapped the minerals of the region more efficiently than you ever could alone and you cared for her as much as you could in return
>Over the course of weeks, you'd go to her kingdom, mine up gold and bring copper you'd adhere to the torn coat to fix It, forming an eventually more intricate version of the old one through combined efforts
>Sometimes night would fall early and she'd let you and the other coat painters work on her while she slept, even accepting you all to lay against her side for the night when too tired to proceed the task, she was not a tyrant after all. 
>You'd all still make up for It by carressing her into sleep during the nights, easing the pain the wounds brought, letting her slumber into dreams more easily than if you hadn't
>She didn't admit It yet, but your presence soothed her
>It was a rare honor she only brought in these times of distress, you'd finish the coat using the very thing that brought your two worlds together, the gold nugget the size of an ingot that made you fell into the underworld. 
>Completing the gold coat with a shining example of teamwork, you shook hands and paws with the painter Gajalakas and hugged your recovering Queen who looked impressed at the craftmanship
>Just like your butterfly was now permanently on her coat, you'd stay in each other's hearts for as long as you'd live
>In the span of months your works are found fruitful as she appears to be doing better than ever, much shinier too. 
>And for insider knowledge, your guild paychecks are also zennyer too with the efficiency you've shown in the discovery of rare metals for the guild. 
>When asked for what you'd like to entrepreneur next, you replied you wanted to take the lead in the study of Monsters, but specifically for the Kulve Taroth mission which surprised members and fellow scholars, 
>Your accumulated knowledge from Gajalakas teaching you basic hunting, fighting and Kulve who taught you key points on monsterkin made you nail the admission process despite never being hunter yourself before
>Now in a positon where you could prevent the hunting of the one you liked, you couldn't be happier, best part is you were also being compensated quite well for It, giving you emple free time to "work" more. 
>By having her be a case of living study, "a specimen needed alive in her natural environment", 
>You protected her world against future hunting research parties you made her kingdom better protected. 
>To add to the official protection, you standing ground against poachers and illegal mining activities allowed Gajalakas to take a well deserved break as Kulve would have the pleasure of seeing more often than ever. 
>The local Gajalakas didn't say It but they regarded you very much as their Queen's new right hand man, if not an inspiration.
