## Top 1000 Artists
1) EasyFluff V11 - https://mega.nz/folder/kigBCaYZ#2x3Wy44-3h05fVodrYlBcQ/folder/8ygQGQLL
2) Currently being worked on by Hyena anon, covers the following wildcard: https://files.catbox.moe/hua623.txt

## The rest
Made while making sure not to cover the same artists as 2) above. There may be overlap with 1), however.

List of all e621 artists with at least 10 posts (truncating the number of artists immensely already), sorted by number of posts on e621 and without conditional dnp, unknown artist, third-party edit, sound warning and anonymous artist: https://files.catbox.moe/mjs8jh.txt

Same as above, but without the artists already covered by the top 1000 above: https://files.catbox.moe/ztq0lp.txt
It should be noted that the splits down below were made from this text file, with the current order being maintained. This means that the splits below represent, for example, artist no. 1 to 1000 with the highest post count, even if the galleries are in alphabetical order.

If you want to pitch in, keep in mind to not sort the file alphabetically until you reduced it to the lines you want to test. Sorting first, then splitting the file will cause overlaps.
