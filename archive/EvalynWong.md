Name: Zhi "Evalyn" Wong.  Introduces herself as Evalyn since coming to Hogwarts, and that is the only name most people know.

Face: Evalyn's face is round and narrow, with small almond-shaped eyes, full cheeks and a round chin.  Her nose and mouth are also small, and overall her face is very symmetrical.  Evalyn usually appears to be a mixture of zen and gloomy, rarely making eye contact and not being particularly expressive.

Hair: She has shiny raven hair often styled in a chin-length bob that features a fringe covering her right eye.  Evalyn's hair has a silken texture to it, making it fairly easy to style or play with.

Eyes: Her small almond eyes have dark brown irises, and more often than not the whites of her eyes will have some redness to them.

Height: With a diminutive stature at 142cm/4'8" tall, Evalyn disappears into crowds easily.

Body type: Svelte build that belies a surprising curviness due to her choices in attire.  Has elegant, gracefully toned legs due to the dance-like nature of her exercise.

Complexion: Pale, porcelain-like skin that is fairly typical for her nationality.  Evalyn has a mole under her left eye, which is probably one of her more distinguishing features.

Uniform Variation: Inconsistent based on her belongings including clothing often being stolen and hidden from her.  Evalyn is often missing overshirts, vests, socks and shoes, ties and much more, giving her a disheveled look while in school.

Voice: Thick Chinese accent, rarely speaks as a result.

Body Language: Typically reticent, subdued behavior with little motion and a notable lack of eye contact.  When cornered into a conversation, Evalyn is very still and stoic, and will look right past the speaker's eyes.  She can appear very zen if observed from afar, and almost never appears distressed.

Social:  With no assertiveness, her small stature and quiet demeanor, Evalyn carries practically zero presence and is hard to find.  Her circle of friends is fairly limited, consisting mostly of people who've noticed her and didn't immediately view her as strange or pathetic.

Visibility: As background as background gets.  So much so, that in group photos she may as well not be there.

Quirks: Very small, calligraphy-like handwriting and prone to saying hopeful proverbs instead of actual communication.  She is ignorant of western customs and will almost always make a mistake somewhere in regards to such.

Things you wouldn't do: Evalyn has no understanding of romance, so she won't (knowingly) go on dates or romantic retreats.  She is adamantly unwilling to bully folks, and this includes her enemies.  Does not turn down requests for help if the request seems honorable.  She won't tell people her actual name, and is very tight-lipped about her association with the imperial chinese court.

Animals: Loves animals of all shapes and sizes, has no desire to be an animagus but finds them interesting.

Misc: Real skilled in wushu, often leaves inspirational messages on billboards, a pretty big pushover who is easy to turn into someone's gopher and a skilled enough healer that people sometimes seek her out for medical attention or folk remedies from the orient.
