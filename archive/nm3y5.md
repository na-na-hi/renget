>Does your MHA have a social media presence?

*"Social media? Uhh... I don't... really use social media..."*

Ashleigh does, in fact, have social media. She acts like an obnoxious (You) goblin online, because she craves the engagement. It's one of her many guilty pleasures.



>Have you been a good hero today?

*"I mean... sure? I guess? I don't know."*

Ashleigh doesn't particularly understand this question. She's a great test taker, and understands in the book-sense what heroes do; but she doesn't understand what it *"means"* to be a good hero in the philosophical sense.



>How do you feel about your quirk?

*"It's... It's useful. I'm okay with it."*

Ashleigh understands that her quirk is a rather effective tool at helping more combat-oriented individuals take down enemies. However, when she was bullied in the past, a not-insignificant portion of it was because of her quirk. A lot of people get extremely weird and freaked out about memory loss, even if it's just the loss of a single minute. Some kids would get furious with her if she was caught looking at them, and so she's developed a habit of trying her best to not look at people directly. In practice this means a lot of looking at the ground, or her table, or her phone, or a book, etc. This is something she's had to work on to make use of her quirk properly, and it's a habit she falls back into a lot. Forget about any sort of eye contact.



>If you had the chance, would you trade your quirk out for a different one?

*"Uh... No. Wouldn't want to get stuck with something useless."*

Exactly what it says on the tin. Despite the trouble her quirk has caused her socially, at least it's useful for something. She'd hate to be one of those people with a quirk that makes their toes light up or something.



>What deeds of 'heroism' have you done lately that you want Senpai to praise you for?

*"Deeds of heroism that I want Senpai to praise me for? Huh?"*

Ashleigh is 0 for 2, on both the deeds of heroism and the senpai praising. She doesn't get out much, and doesn't know any of the upperclassmen well enough to want any sort of praise from them.



>Who is your favorite Pro Hero?

*"I, uh... don't really keep up with famous heroes. I guess Rosethorn, since I've met her and she seems rather kind and reliable?"*

Exactly what it says on the tin.



>Who do you think has the most potential, good or evil, among our up and comers?

*"For good, Noah's about as good as they come from what I can tell. As for evil, I'd rather not put that on anyone..."*

Though Ashleigh would rather not speak evil on anyone, she hold an unfavorable view of several in class. Primarily the quintet, Hifumi, Shinkan, and Sora.



>What's your favorite snack?

*"Oranges are nice, healthy snacks!"*

Ashleigh likes a good Orange, and most other citrus fruits for that matter. Tangerines, Mandarins, Grapefruits, etc.



>Do you jaywalk?

*"I mean, not REALLY..."*

Ashleigh would only jaywalk when it's convenient and when absolutely no one else is around. The perfect crime; how villainous.



>Have you done anything to help others today?

*"I cleaned the house and washes the dishes, I guess."*

Ashleigh does her best to take care of the house, so that her father doesn't have any more work to do when he gets home.



>What's your ultimate move called, what's it do, and have you used it before?

*"I wouldn't really call strangling someone with a whip until they pass out an 'ultimate move'..."*

Ashleigh's quirk doesn't really lend itself to flashy maneuvers. Perhaps one day she'll start thinking outside the box with her cable whip and do some really crazy stunts with it.



>Do you plan to commission any tools or gadgets when you get the funds? If so, who from?

*"It'd be nice to have a pair of glasses with a zoom function. That way, I wouldn't have to worry about making my teammates black out."*

Exactly what it says on the tin. As for who she'd commission it from, she doesn't know who. She'd probably just ask her dad to commission this pair of glasses from the same person who made her cable whip and her quirk timer. Whoever that may be...



>Do you have exceptional willpower?

*"Well, I try really hard. That's what's important, right? ...Right?"*

Ashleigh is a coward when it comes to combat or anything dangerous. She'll tackle it head on, but her will rapidly drains when she comes up against any strong resistance. That being said, she does have tremendous patience for things that are not combat-oriented or particularly intense. For example, she has no problem waiting for hours with nothing to do, or doing any incredibly tedious but simple tasks. Her thoughts usually keep her busy through these things. She would be very well suited to reconnaissance operations. Or an office job.



>What are your thoughts on the Night Parade?

*"I don't know... they're just a street gang or something, right? I mean, I wouldn't want to be on the wrong end of them, but..."*

The prospect of fighting a street gang is not an enticing one to Ashleigh. She would like to have nothing to do with the Night Parade, though her studies at Shiketsu and her endeavor to become a pro hero will likely put her on a crash course with them at some point.



>Which of the Pro Hero PCs would your character most want to intern under?

Refer to the earlier question about favorite heroes. Again, it would probably be Rosethorn.



>What kind of hero do you want to become?

*"Being a useful sidekick'd be enough for me..."*

Not one for the limelight, Ashleigh would prefer to play second fiddle to someone stronger than her, and live in her own little niche microcelebrity corner with a small but very dedicated fanbase.



>What kind of coffee do you like?

*"Iced Caramel Frappe. With a shot of espresso."*

With some cinammon on top. Ashleigh also enjoys green tea.



>Let's talk residencies.

*"I just live with my dad. Standard single family Japanese home, I think."*

Ashleigh lives in a fairly average middle-class home with her dad. It's about a ten-minute walk from Shiketsu, so she walks to and from school. The only thing of note in her room is probably her desktop PC. A four year old gaming PC that was top of the line when it came out. Still works just fine for what she uses it for, though it could probably stand to be cleaned out. It's looking a little dusty.



>What's your greatest fear? What scares you, more than anything else?

*"Probably betrayal, or being used. It's humiliating..."*

Ashleigh's greatest fears are primarily social ones. She'd hate to be the designated punching bag once again, and as such is very anxious about most social interactions. That being said, she's also terribly afraid that she might be 'alone' forever. Outside of social and philosophical fears though, she's overheard other students talking about something creepy, crawling around outside of schools late at night. The thought of something like that is enough to have her paranoid about it even when walking to school in the mornings, and to have her speedwalking home in the afternoons.



>Greatest strength, personality wise?

*"I uh... I don't know."*

Ashleigh's low self-esteem and poor self-image don't allow her to acknowledge the better parts of herself. Her best trait is probably her loyalty. If someone sticks their neck out for Ashleigh (or honestly, treats her with the bare-minimum level of kindness), she'll do her best to support them every chance she gets.
