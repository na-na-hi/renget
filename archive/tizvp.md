>be Cover Corp. maintenance guy
>you're working outside on some stupid shrubs
>you hear giggling from far away
>it's getting closer
>accompanied by one distinct voice
>whining various 'no!" and 'stop!" pleads
>you can hear it even over your headphones
>popping those out of your ears, you turn around to see the source of the noise
>out comes HoloX in full
>four of them giggling with dainty little fistfuls of pink fabric wrapped around the knuckles
>the last one held off her high heels by that harness of fabric
>a killer of a gang wedgie if you had ever seen one
>and the victim of that gang wedgie was the last one of the group you'd ever expect to be wearing pink granny panties
>Lui, the hawk girl
>...who you definitely hadn't stolen a few stares at the tight ass before
>you just happened to know that her shorts normally were accompanied by a skimpy thong or less
>regardless, it looked painful
>the hawk kicking her legs, hands clamped over her lady bits with little tears in the corners of her eyes
>"To the flagpole! Uraaa!" the demon-horned brat with practically the entire seat of those nerdy panties over her greedy little hands
>"Uraaah!" - a response from three, raising their fists
>"Ssstoooooooooop!" 
>Lui's voice was definitely an octave higher on that one than you remembered it normally being
>your eyes tracked the gen, Lui kicking her long legs as they bounced her along
>her hands moved from her womanhood to ass of her shorts at some point too
>you also became aware that you were working very close to the flagpole
>in truth, you had freed quite a number of destroyed pairs of women's undergarments from the flagpole's hooks before
>you'd never seen a "Lui" on any of the dorky nametags and waistbands you've snapped off before though
>nor have you seen any of those famed Hololive flagpole wedgies actually happen
>well, until now
>"Losers get wedgies! You know the rules!"
>"I'm not a fuckin- ow, ow, ow!"
>them lowering Lui to the ground was less than pleasant 
>the snaps and groans of those pinky panties was more than clear about that
>you watch with raised eyebrows as the gang gets to work
>Lui dancing on her toes, face red and eyes wide
>Iroha and Koyori held her arms while Laplus did the honors of tangling the rope with her panties
>the messy knots were always the hardest to get the underwear free of the next morning, you knew
>"Wait, wait, before we send her up..."
>you could hear Chloe before she trailed off with a motion to the hawk's viciously tight shorts
>were they really going to...?
>"By the command of Laplus Dia Highest..."
>Laplus just had to give her full name
>you tuned it out to watch Lui flail around for the last few seconds cutely
>poor girl couldn't decide if she wanted to cup her womanhood or her ass cheeks
>both were probably sore as hell just from being bounced all the way here, you assumed
>"...to pants her!"
>yep
>you didn't think Lap had it in her to do it
>"Wait, wait, wait, no...!"
>Lui tried to argue but hands were already in her shorts
>they, as a group, managed to wrestle down Lui's tight shorts to her ankles
>Iroha did the bulk of the work, kneeling in front of Lui to peel them off the girl's ankles and off entirely
>the blush that exploded onto her face when she looked up told you more than enough
>you couldn't see from here, but maybe that was for the best for what little dignity Lui could be left with
>"They're so deep in there..." Koyori stared
>"Stop looking!"
>"Did you not want us to because..." Chloe bit her lip
>"A fresh shave is needed, degozaru..."
>you really wished you could see now, but as you adjusted your work pants to accommodate a new issue in the front, maybe that was also for the best
>"Can you just send me up the flagpole already! No one needs to see this!"
>Lui was utterly humiliated, you could hear it in her voice
>her hands were solidly over her crotch now that her entire gen had seen her in full glory
>which just meant you could see her entire, pale ass and her wedged-up undies
>you could bounce a quarter off it, goddamn
>"Oi, stop staring and help me!"
>Laplus, who barely could grow anything downstairs anyway, was not nearly as sympathetic
>she had actually been pulling on the rope this whole time
>but now, six more hands were joining her holding it
>"I'm getting you guys back so bad next week..."
>Lui grumbled, her cheeks still burning red with humiliation that was about to get worse
>"Heave!"
>"...fuuuck..."
>the realization set in, even you could tell from where you watched
>"Ho!"
>"FUC-GWAK!"
>you cringed in sympathy
>"Ow, ow, ow, ow, OW!"
>Lui practically screeched the entire way up
>what very little coverage her wedgied pantied had provided before was now gone
>they stretched up to her neck in the back
>and even behind her hands, you could tell the goods were on display up front
>you had to look away as slips of pink flesh peeked out for a split-second when Lui's arms shifted
>"Mega wedgie complete! See you in the morning, wedgie girl!"
>"Hehe, wedgie girl..."
>Chloe thought Laplus' comment was funny at least
>and with that, the rest of HoloX walked off
>leaving their mature, big sister member where she was
>hanging at the top of the company flagpole
>half-naked, her dorky panties stretched up to her neck
>and enough tears in her eyes to show she was going to need an ice pack for a week
>you couldn't help out now, you'd need to wait
>you had to get back to work anyway
>////////////////////////////
>by sunset, you had finished trimming the shrubs and watering the grass and everything else you were supposed to do for the day
>except one thing
>...lower the flag
>you awkwardly made your way over to the flagpole's base
>you had to try really hard to not stare at the pantsed, wedgied bird hanging limp above you
>her ass was pressed against the cold metal of the flagpole
>and her underwear was stretched to the point of never being wearable again
>not in her usual shorts anyway
>you did eventually look up, and despite your better judgment, call out:
>"hey, I'll get you down now!" you shout
>you got a weak thumbs up back
>as you loosened the tie that Laplus and friends had left, the weight on the other end deceived you
>it was only a few inches of slack
>but the resulting screech had you sheepishly looking up at the poor girl
>you may have just accidentally... dropped her 6 inches into a wedgie bounce
>past the brim of your hat, your suspicions were confirmed
>bungeeing softly by the remaining elastic left in her panties
>cross-eyed like a dork
>lip-bitten like she ate a lemon
>long legs spread out and extended
>hands frozen at her abdomen level in shock
>...was poor Lui, who was probably going to kill you for that when she got down
>still, it felt ungentlemanly to leave her up there
>with much more care with the rope this time, you lowered the hawk lady back to the ground
>you tried not to stare but
>you could see her name proudly written in marker on the inside waistband from just how far it'd stretched up her back
>...and the stubble the other girls had seen...
>slowly but surely, you got Lui down to the last foot above the ground
>all you had to do was reach around and undo the knot and she'd be-
>SCRIRPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP
>the panties practically disintegrated at the final moment
>the last of their elastic groaned
>they slipped through Lui's undercarriage
>and then through her tight, clenched cheeks and off entirely
>you distinctly heard a whimper for mommy in there as the last inches of fabric fwip'd off of her
>the rope went slack in your right hand and you dropped it
>and Lui literally fell forwards into your waiting arms
>it could have been romantic if not for... literally everything else
>seriously, you could see the damn composition of her underwear written on the tag from where you stood
>90% cotton and some cheap-ass brand you'd never heard of
>for a schoolyard prank, that had been...
>probably about as painful as it had been mortifyingly humiliating
>Lui slipped away from you and into a crouch, one hand deep between her thighs
>nursing her womanhood from the flossing it'd just received
>"....ahwwwwwwwwwowww... owwww...."
>you swear you hear her say something about never having kids behind hisses of pain
>you decided not to say anything about her nudity, or her underwear, or her slightly-unkempt pubes
>slipping off your work jacket and offering it to her with your head turned away and a quiet "hey"
>Lui was still Lui, though
>big sister through and through
>she bit her lip and took your jacket, wrapping it around her waist
>she was covered now at least
>the red marks and soreness from everything between her ass crack and other 'crack' would take some ice and lotion to fix 
>"S-So..." Lui stood up finally, looking at you with hawk-eyes that saw all the questions in your head
>"...I am going to- ow... going to put the other girls up here soon..."
>her voice was still high-pitched and girly
>and again, her undies were still left in a knot on the flagpole
>she was hardly intimidating
>"...by the front for Laplus..."
>you heard her mutter under her breath
>she focused back to you
>"Do not let them down."
>and with that, she walked off with your work-jacket as a makeshift skirt
>she would have looked cool if not for having to stop 5 feet away to do a little pain dance
>as for you, you had to finish up with the flag
>for once, you'd get to untangle freshly-ripped panties from the flagpole tonight
>it beat peeling off the usual Nene briefs after her dates with the flagpole in the morning
