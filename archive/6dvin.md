NCG FAQ 

Q: PvP?
A: None. Sometimes events have ranking stages that reward profile icons, borders, or other similar collectibles which don't affect gameplay.

Q: Guilds/Clans?
A: None.

Q: Is the game F2P friendly?
A: The game gives a generous amount of currency and opportunities to earn plenty of extra resources. It is not uncommon to see many players with 90-100% Doll collection even as F2P.

Q: Gacha rates?
A: 3.6% SSR, Rate up units are 1%, the remaining 2.6% is split among off-banner Dolls.
60-roll soft pity (random SSR)
180-roll hard pity (guaranteed rate up unit + 30 Fragments)

Q: Do I need dupes?
A: No, dupes are turned into a universal currency called Neural Kits which can be used to purchase additional character fragments outside of daily farming stages.
1 ⭐  = 5 Kits
2 ⭐ = 60 Kits
3 ⭐ = 300 Kits
In a future update, there will be a banner type that rewards character fragments directly for dupes instead of Neural Kits. The choice is yours.

Q: Why are only 1, 2, and 3⭐ Dolls available in the gacha?
A: Those are the base starting rarities of Dolls. 
3⭐ is the equivalent of an SSR. All Dolls can be upgraded to 5⭐

Q: Rerolling?
A: It isn't necessary, but feel free to if you want that 'perfect start'.

Q: What is the daily time investment?
A: Around 5-10 minutes for dailies. Weeklies are mostly just longer versions of daily quests and will be completed just by doing dailies.

Q: Is this a main game or a side game?
A: Side-game. There won't be anything to stress about or grind for long periods of time.

Q: How long does it take to max a Doll's rarity?
A: A 3⭐ will take a little over a month to farm enough fragments without purchasing extra with Neural Kits. Lower starting rarities will take slightly longer.
Raising Friendship levels also award a few fragments.

Q: How many Rolls can be earned monthly?
A: See attached image.
