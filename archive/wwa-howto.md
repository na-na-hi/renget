##### What Do I Need To Start?
In Order to get involved, all you need is a singular character to jump in and join the e-federation. We have plenty of characters and users already, so be sure to come up with as unique an idea as you can in order to get noticed quickly. It's a good idea to consult our wiki or the general itself to get a good grasp of what is currently happening the Waifu Wrestling Alliance before you start posting yourself. Most /wwa/ regulars are welcoming however so following what you want to do and find enjoyable is overall best.

##### How Can I Create A Character?
Unless you consider yourself an artist, you are unlikely to be illustrating your character's design yourself. Which is why we generally reccommend an ai image generator such as the one linked in the general's OP. This will allow you to quickly get a good idea of your character's appearance and perhaps, defining characteristics which will no doubt help you fit in and excel going forward. If you wish to try something a bit more in depth than the generators that are offered for free online. Why not consult RRanon's helpful guide on how to set up your own, far more versatile, ai generator on your PC. https://waifumania.fandom.com/wiki/Resources

##### How To Best Get Involved?
Simply posting an image of your character and telling us about them is a good way to start, but if you know anything about pro-wrestling, then big impacts are normally the best first impression. Why not jump in and cut a promo as your character about them joining the federation? Or perhaps get stuck in a big storyline that is ongoing and letting your creativity take the wheel. Just remember, this is a cooperative project. No one likes a self mark and if you can't work together, you'll be finding yourself working alone pretty quickly. If you want your character to be represented accurately in the simulations, then telling us their finishing maneveurs, entrance and strengths will let us better recreate them in the video game.
