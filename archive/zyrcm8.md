>(You) and Roboco had a nice relationship, but it's gotten complicated. 
>(You) were once the person to help her chase her dream on what was then a small, up incoming company known as Cover Corp. 
>(You) worked tirelessly day and night, week after week, to keep this dream of hers a reality. You really loved her. 
But it's different now.
>(You) were fired from your workplace. Was it a month ago? Perhaps more, perhaps less. The rat race got intense. Japanese work culture did not forgive, and you were behind.
>(You) weren't the one to bring the food to the table anymore. It's been exactly four years since you and Roboco got into a relationship, and the roles got swapped. You were, by all means, a worthless loser. 
>(You) got diagnosed antideppresants. You gave it a go in hopes to feel whole again, but it was of no use. 
>(You) and her have grown apart. You starve for her touch. It's been a whole month, now you are sure. 
>(You) coudn't help yourself that day. She had come back from Cover, making sure her throat was healthy for her next song cover. It was inmediate, impusive, lustful acting from you. 
>The man she had fallen in love with had more composure. But she still loved you. She gave in as you groped her breast, and shut the door closed to push her against it. To fuck in the living like that without even saying welcome home... You are pathethic. 
>And yet she reached for your lips and joined you in a tongue kiss. Clothes off soon followed. That cared for, precious throat of hers... You absolutely ruined.
>And yet (You) were not happy. This is something she could feel. Her body, specifically built for your cock, was made to make you cum. Yet you didnt grace her mouth with your sperm. Your cock wasn't even fully erect. The pills side effects were showing off... But she had no way of knowing. You kept it all for yourself, confident on the fact that you were going to get it all together. You didn't want to worry her, and bring her down with your problems, but you did anyways.
>Roboco didn't give up. If something had never failed her, was her robopussy. She pushed you away slowly, her honey-colored orbs looking you directly in the eyes as a trail of saliva was all that was left connecting your lips. She ran away to the sofa, legs wide open. 
>No words were muttered. You grabbed her hips, your back bowing to reach for her mouth once more. You thrusted like an animal, but it was of no use. Pleasure turned into dissatisfaction, followed ny anger. Your movements were getting wilder, she was hurting.
A-anon, please... Stop.
>But (You) coudn't stop. Her expression changed as you didn't let go, from a submissive, pleased look, to a worried, annoyed one. 
I-it's enough. We're going nowhere...
>(You) felt your heart sink. It finally dawned on you just how much of a failure you were. You loved her, god knows you loved her... That's why you coudn't see her to the face. You ran to the bathroom, and took a long, needed bath. You wanted to calm down and sort your feelings in solitude... But all you did was beat your meat off until you finally ended. It hurt... Reaching climax didn't feel good at all. It was one more hour of bath, all to finally leave with no tears left to shed. 
>(You) dropped your meds that very day. Bu you were the same, disgusting piece of trash. 
>It was you both special day. The 4th anniversary. She used to get exited about it weeks in advance, yet you had not heard a word this time.
>Roboco was fully absorbed by work. Perhaps it was her way of coping with problems. Perhaps she gave up on you, and had someone right there in the company to take off her frustrations, someone that wasn't trash like you. 
>(You) were asked by her to receive a package. She said it was important work related stuff, for you to please not open as your autistic curious ass used to do all the time.
>It got there, late into the night. You knew you shoudn't... But you coudn't help. She had such a nervous, suspicious look about it all...
>(You) ended up peeking on the mysterious box, revelating robot pieces. You knew these all too well; upgrades for her lower genitalia. 
>(You)r worst fears were true.
>(You) could feel your emotions cramming up, barely capable of holding tears of anguish. 
(Toc toc toc)
>But there was no time to process them. 
>(You) repackaged the accesory as convincingly as you could. She called your name at the door, and you opened up once you were done.
Anon!
>She remarked, peppy. A gentle smile was visible on her face. Someone probably gave her the day you failed to give her on bed.
