After a long night the girls reach their hotel room. They enjoyed a nice dinner in Taco bell and now were completely exhausted they all fumble onto the beds, not even changing any of the clothes they were all wearing the whole day. 

Mumei was so tired she collapsed with her back to the floor, the others found it amusing. Well except for Ina who walked towards the sleepy owl in their floor.

"Oi don't fall asleep just yet, something bad could happen to you" Ina said is mischievous tone.

"Ahhhh I just want to sleep leave me alone Ina-senpai" Mumei grumbled.

"Ok don't mind meeee" 

After ushering those words Ina squatted down on Mumei's face, making sure her entire crotch covered Mumei's mouth and nose. The rest of the girls found Ina's little prank amusing and didn't try to stop it, rather they encouraged it.

Mumei could only whine in protest, using her hands to try and push Ina off her face. This normally wouldn't be a big deal for her to endure but the rancid stink of Ina's sweaty bottom was getting to her. She even wondered if Ina took a bath before that day, this wasn't the smell normal day's worth of sweat.

"You know what? I think I'll stay here for a bit longer, it's kinda comfy" Ina says as she adjusts her weight to be fully sat on top of Mumei's face.

Mumei dreading having to spend another second trapped there began trying to pull away.

"Oh no, you don't!" Ame hold firmly both of Mumei's legs in place, ensuring she couldn't get away.

"Nice Ame!" Ina cheered. "Seriously Mumei, why do you resist so much?. There is nothing to be afrai-- Aghh.... except for this sorry sorry sorry!"

A loud gurgle was heard coming from Ina's tummy, followed by blast of wet farts. Mumei felt the entire impact of each one of them in her face as they came, almost like she was being forced to swallow all of Ina's bowel waste.

"WOW where did that came from" said Kronni in shock. 

"I-I-I'm sorry!! it must smell so bad. I knew I shouldn't have eaten those" Ina apologized, a few tears forming in her eyes

"Actually.... I don't really smell anything" said Fauna.

"Oh man, Mumei you make for a great a fart cushion" Ame teased. "Why don't you let me try? hmm"

Ame pushed Ina aside. Mumei was finally able to breath fresh air for a few seconds until Ame's giant ass came crushing down. She pressed down with all her weight to make sure not a single fart could escape. 

"I've been holding out for quite bit, you don't mind, riiiiight?"

Mumei could only think to herself *oh gosh...not again*.

Ame pressed down on her tummy and quickly released a giant blast of gas. The smell was unbearable, Mumei could only hold her breath in an vain attempt to don't sniff the putrid air forming around her as Ame kept relieving herself on the poor girl.

"Uuu Ame-senpai..." Fauna interrupted shyly "Can I go too..? I can't hold out anymore"

"Oh come on! I'm not even done yet!" Ame lashed out. "Fine I'll give you some space next to me, Hey mumei you're working double now!"

Ame adjusted herself to give Fauna enough space to let it rip, almost like if they were trying to share a toilet. Mumei sure didn't like to feel like one right now, but that was the least of her problems, she needed to take some air or she'd faint at this rate. 

"This will be quick I promise, you can do it! just a bit more!"

Fauna's encouragement rang a bit hollow for the little birdie, after all she had now two asses aiming straight at her. It didn't take long for Fauna to let out a fart that echoed through the whole room, Ame followed it after with one of her own, even louder than the ones that came before. *Fuck it, I'm not dying over this* Mumei thought while gasping at the stench surrounding her. She couldn't decide which was worse, Ame's were completely nauseating but Fauna's stink was so unbelievably rancid to make her faint.

"Hey, hey wake up" said Kronii

"Uhhhhhhhhhhh ......Am I alive? I-I-I did it..! *cough cough*" Mumei yelled in a confused tone.

It was already morning, everyone else has left by this point. Kronii was left in charge on taking care of the knocked out owl.

"And that is how it went, they did ask me to pass along her apologies for you know..." 

"I'll get back to them don't worry but ummm" Mumei looked down. "Why am I all tied up in the bathroom again?"

"Weeell  I was kinda  left out of the fun yesterday so I hope you don't mind if I do my morning business with you. It's only fair, right?"

"NO, IT'S NOT!" Mumei angrily yelled.

"Too bad. I need to go like really bad, that spicy food from yesterday is just screaming to get out so open up that cute mouth of yours"

"*sigh* Why me..."

Kronii took her panties off and stood her ass in front of Mumei's face. Small farts would come out from time to time, the smell warned the poor bird what was coming was even worse. Kronii grumbled as her asshole started to stretch out.

"Oh god It's coming, catch it fast!" 

Kronii bite her lips and pushed out a long snake like turd out of her ass. Mumei has no option but to try and fit it all in her mouth. She tries her best but it just keeps on coming and with no better alternative she chews and swallows as fast she can until it finally stops.

"*phew* You did a good job, I'm impres- Oh fuck hold on a second" 

A huge rumble echoes through the bathroom as Kronni releases another wave of fecal matter, this time all barely solid. Mumei with no time to react is covered entirely on Kronii's poorly digested feces. 

"......Yeah I think I'm done now, hehe sorry"

"*sigh* Can I take a bath before we go? Also remind me to never go taco bell with you guys ever again"

**Off collabs sure are fun**
