# Kazen Uzumaki Jutsu Info

##Kekkai Genkai
>Adamantine Chains
Mystical Chakra Chains that extend out from the user's body and are impervious to chakra based attacks. Although they can be broken, it'd require tremendous sheer force as these chains are said to be able to hold down The Tailed Beasts themselves. Once ensnared they seal away an opponent's chakra but have great destructive and defensive power as well. He incorporates these chains into his Taijutsu by using the chains as if they were a part of his body, using them like tendril legs to lift him off the ground or tendril arms to grab faraway them to launch himself forward at high speed.

##Jutsu
>Paper Arts: Uzumaki Sealing Tags
Uses Paper Style he controls countless paper seals flying throughout the air, to attack or defend himself. When in danger he'll move a paper tag to seal up incoming obstacles or jutsu and then can release the seal to send them back towards an opponent. An opponent can also be placed into these seals if he captures them in his chains. He can bombard opponents by sealing a weapon or jutsu inside, usually an ally's then releasing the seal towards them or on top of them.

##Hidden Techniques
>Seal Activation: Cursed Fist
If he's adorned his shinigami beads, he can activate curse seals which spread across Kazen’s arm, allowing him to harness Cursed Chakra more easily. For close combat he forms this chakra into a ball of destructive energy in his hand that pierces a target’s defense. However he can also use this at longer range, firing beams and waves of Cursed Chakra Energy.

##Special Technique
>Dance of The Shikigami
Transforms his body either partially or completely into sheets of paper seal tags, allowing him to avoid most physical attacks. He can then immediately counterattacking with a paper bomb substitution or attempt to bind them in paper. By transforming his body into paper, he can launch his Adamantine Chains from any of the scattered seals, allowing them to attack from any direction and capture then seal his opponents inside. Combing this technique with his Paper Style, he can form large paper vortex attacks, hail down paper tag shuriken, create paper shields. . While in this Paper Form he can fly around the battlefield by either dispersing into paper seals but also sealing himself and allies within the paper talismans to leap out fast and surprise opponents.

>Paper Arts: Tandem Arms of the Asura
Instead of growing angel wings, Kazen creates two sets of arms made of tandem paper seals. Each tandem seal summons more seal tags allowing him to chain-use his paper tag jutsu. By applying this technique to his Paper Bombs, he can perform the famed Paper Tandem Bombs, as well as use his paper seal arms for explosive hits and explosive movement. He can also summon paper seals for storing incoming jutsu and weapons or chain-release the collective ninjutsu and objects he sealed throughout the battle, and allow him to more easily release them in close range/mid combat. 

##Secret Technique
>Uzumaki Secret Art: Reaper Possession Summoning
His most dangerous technique, Kazen wraps prayer beads around his left arm and starts chanting unintelligibly. He then suddenly begins to transform as the Shinigami begins to possess him, thus taking on its appearance and abilities. Growing red horns and having his hair turn long and white, eyes turning black and gold and teeth becoming jagged. With his possessed body, Kazen is much faster and stronger and gains a cursed arm that shifts to the Shinigami’s growing larger and purple. The arm grants him immense brute strength, as well as the ability to stretch inhumanly far or wider for attack and defense. Its greatest ability is shifting his body into an incorporeal form, allowing him to pass through the physical world and interact with the ethereal world. Although Kazen cannot maintain this form for very long and the shift isn’t instantaneous, the form is also susceptible to Barrier Arts as well as attacks that affect astral beings. While being possessed, much like a Jinchurki, Kazen can access the Shinigami’s Chakra pool as well as resist Genjutsu. While in this trance he's constantly feeling the pull of the Shinigami on his mind and will often seem to talk or cackle to himself.
