#The Oni's Rebellion



34 seconds...
33 seconds...
32 seconds...

"Dinner's ready, just in time to save my ass! And your stomach, hopefully."
Ayame hurried to your seat at the dinner table with a proud expression, her red eyes fixed you.
"Here's the omurice, sir! It's quite the modern dish and I've never made it so fast, but I'm sure you'll enjoy it as always! And if it's okay for me to desert you for a bit, I could fetch something from the freezer for the final course."


"I knew my little brat could do her work properly – with the right motivation. But I don't think there's something in the freezer that beats having you here. There's always time for something properly prepared later on."

At this point you were already familiar with Ayame's omurice; this wasn't the prettiest one she ever made, but a good effort given the time constraints. You rewarded her with a smile and a caress of her rosy cheek.
Your girlfriend curtsied with a giggle before putting ketchup artwork on the omurice as if you were at a maid café. Her giggles were as cute as ever, but her curtsies had become much more elegant over time – partly thanks to your training, but mostly because of the practice she had put in for your sake. Ayame must have practised a lot over the last week considering how many curtsying photos and videos she had sent you to brighten your shifts at work.

"Look! It's a rope wrapping around a heart to symbolize the bond between us – and the ropes stashed in the closet. We'll get to those later, right?"

You gave your adorable girlfriend a grin and a nod. She responded with a heartwarming smile that only got stronger as you gave her some headpats; you followed them up by keeping your hand on top of her head and pressing down gently.
Ayame got the hint and obeyed perfectly as you made her look down and kneel. You stopped before her legs were fully bent, her spanked bottom still hovering a good bit above her ankles. Based on previous endurance tests and her physique, your oni was fit compared to the average human; but kneeling with a 45° angle between thighs and lower legs wasn't the easiest position to hold for a long time. That was what made it so nice, though: Seeing Ayame exert herself in a desire to remain obedient was never not a turn-on.

"Stay like this for now, hm? Maybe we'll find a new position for you, depending on how good this omurice tastes."

A tiny nod was the proper answer you got as Ayame kept her head down and her thighs up stoically, not only remembering the rule about not speaking while kneeling but also obeying it – both for your and her sake.

Turning your attention to the second most attractive thing in the room, you took your spoon and finally dug into your dinner. There wasn't anything to complain about with the egg, the rice or the spice – they were still quite hot, but that was on you. Despite the struggle visible on Ayame's face and her increasingly quivering legs, your girlfriend remained in her proper place while you savoured most of your late dinner. You decided to be nice by releasing her early.
"Mhm...finally, some good fucking food; my compliments to the chef. Want something of it as well?"

A happy smile came over the kneeling demon's face, turning into a mischievous one as she quickly crawled to your side. She put her head under the hand that you had held out as a silent beckoning – high enough to let her kneel easier.

"I'm happy you like it, sir! Always a treat seeing you enjoy what I made, but I'll eat what you give me. Your pleasure's my pleasure, hm? You don't even need to fuck me right now, just let me take care of your needs..."
Ayame's desire to make herself happy by making you happy was heart-warming, even if brazenly expressed. She was smart and playful enough to go along with your bait about her getting to eat, even though she likely suspected that you wouldn't let her blow you just yet.

"I know what you'd like to eat, but I don't have a use for your handlebars just yet."

"Don't call them han-HEY!"
When it came to taking pride in her demonic features Ayame was a typical oni, but the same could not be said for her weight; picking her up from the floor by the armpits was as easy as it was delightful.

"Come on, I'll feed you some of your great omurice. You deserve it."

But Ayame was far more panicked than pleased, refusing to bring up her legs to let you lift her above your lap.
"NO! WAIT! Don't make me sit on your lap, please! My ass is still really vulnerable, An- sir!"

You couldn't help but smirk at her panic as you separated your legs. She did show a lack of trust, but you had pulled fast ones on her in situations like this before.
"Just put your thighs on mine and your butt will be between my legs. Follow my lead, Nakiri."

Upon hearing the one name you would not use in vain, Ayame did as she was told almost instantly, letting you bring her over your lap and supporting herself by wrapping her arms around your chest while her comparatively small thighs came to rest on yours. You supported her with your left arm and reclined to let her lean into you, leaving her violated cheeks untouched by your legs. A look of relief came over Ayame's face as she tilted her head and looked up at you.

"Damn, I thought I messed up and was about to get my just desserts."

"No desserts for either of us, I'm afraid. You didn't make any."

"Hey, I offered you – well, whatever we still have the freezer! There was no time to prepare a proper second course."

"I know, I know. That's on me."

"And why would we need dessert, hm? You and me, we're already so sweet ourselves..." she whispered, sultry and enchanting – like a very different kind of demon.

The oni scratched your nape with her nails, baring one of her fangs to hit you with her cutest smile as your gaze met hers.
All your thoughts were swept away in an instant as your heart was smitten once more by your hedonist, your oni, your lover. How lucky you were to feel her petite figure leaning against you, to see her long gradient hair framing her beautiful face, to get lost in her red eyes lit up with love, to desire her cute fanged mouth, the mouth that could produce all kinds of heavenly sounds and sensations...
The spoonful of omurice you had wanted to feed her landed back on the plate right as your lips landed on hers.

Your beloved was no less eager; the simple kiss didn't last long before she opened her mouth, beckoning you to enter. Her tongue and the inside of her mouth were always noticeably hotter than those of humans, but not uncomfortably so. Her long tongue welcomed yours enthusiastically by twirling around it in eerie, yet very enticing ways.
You kept to slow and firm movements, enjoying the contrast between her frenzy and your stoicism as much as she did. You answered her hands wildly stroking and lightly scratching your back with a firm grip on her small frame, her high-pitched moans with quiet grunts, her wild tongue with one that knew when to push and when to hold. And every time you pulled her body closer to you and pushed down her fiery tongue with yours, she submitted and remained still until you released her again – a game erotic, romantic and fun in equal measure.

After a few minutes of bliss, you gently caressed Ayame's temple and gave her one last smooch as you slowly brought your tongue back into your cool mouth. She let you go without pursuit, resting her head against your chest with satisfied humming. You planted a quick kiss on her left horn just below its apex before bringing your chin down in between her horns that were so fun to grab and...no, this was the time for cuddling. The evening was still as long as your girlfriend was lovely.

"I'm so glad to have you, Ayame."

"And I'm glad you're having me, Anon! Us taking care of each other is making this the best decade of my life ever since...y'know."

You intervened before her smile could fully fade, presenting her with a spoonful of happiness.
"Shh. Time to eat your part, you deserve it."

Ayame's face lit up again as she got to taste the fruits of her labour.
"Yum, tasty! I'm a great omurice speed cooker, right?"

"Sure, but I'm still hungry. Fetch me some biscuits and cider, would you?"
You lifted Ayame by her waist, stood up and threw her high into the air (earning you a little squeal) before catching her and putting her on her feet, which she followed up with a little bow.

"Sure Anon, and I'll get to the leftover housework right after! I need something to distract me if you're not fucking me or letting me suck your cock just yet..."

You couldn't help but smile at her open neediness.
"Nope. But you might get there – if you play your cards right. Looking forward to seeing what you've got."

Ayame met your smile with a grin; you could practically see her competitive side flaring up now that you had put the ball firmly in her court. She quickly went to the kitchen and back, delivering your snack and drink with a bow.
"Here you are, sir."

"Thank you, Ayame."

"Bon appétit once more! And don't worry, I'll earn us those orgasms. Just watch me!"

After a headpat of encouragement answered by a sugary-sweet chuckle, you left Ayame to her own devices to have some alone time with your snacks and your thoughts. You deliberated on what to do next, taking into account that Ayame would probably initiate some kind BDSM play to get to suck you off as a stopgap measure since it'd be a while before she and the evening got to climax.

Eating and thinking helped to calm your own libido – it wasn't easy to deny your body and your girlfriend when you had just had her on your lap in the perfect position, making out vigorously. But she would have to make due with the fulfillment she got from BDSM, and from pleasuring you. As far as her sexual desires went you would deny her to the point of despair – both of you found it hot as hell when her sex drive got hung out to dry, only to find salvation in the end. 
And whatever she might do next, you could always finger her or make her touch herself, but without allowing her to cum...no, that'd be too harsh as a response to her good conduct; maybe later. Letting her blow you if she came up with something fun was a good compromise at present.

You didn't heed the noises of Ayame at work in the corridor as your deliberations about making this evening as glorious as it could be continued. Knowing your brat, she would probably act up to tease you into humiliating her – maybe you could give her your presents then. You had also promised her that you'd tie her up; but bondage was best paired with fucking her silly, so may- 
A small gust of cool air derailed your train of thought; the windows were closed, so it had to be your oni's doing again.

You went into the corridor, and there the oni stood: Facing away from you, towards the mirror on the wall. Ayame seemed focused, but not on you or herself. Her attention was fixed on the sword in her hand – the "cursed blade" Rasetsu, as she called it. You had never asked what this "curse" entailed, but a cold aura and an ominous mist always surrounded the weapon's slender form. 
Ayame was tenderly, almost meditatively wiping her ancient sword off with a fine cloth, as she tended to do at least twice per week; you had never observed the blade in anything other than perfect condition.

"Can't you clean your oni gear when I'm at work? I told you it magically cooling down the house makes me uncomfortable, alongside its weird...aura, or whatever it is."

Ayame's response sounded unusually calm and deep, almost emotionless.
"An oni tends to her heirlooms when she pleases – cling to a radiator if the chill bothers you. But most importantly, cease disrespecting artefacts simply for being beyond your comprehension. Letting too many insults go unpunished would be a threat to my honour as an oni, you know?"

This wasn't how she usually responded to you, even considering the subject matter and your tone. An instinctual fear of the incomprehensible side of your demon girlfriend came into your heart – but only until you noticed your brat winking at you in the mirror before she went back to tending her sword with a stoic expression.
So this was the game she wanted to play to progress her quest into your pants? Not a bad idea, all things considered.

You leaned against the door frame, putting snideness in your voice and your trust in her.
"Pretty big words from a dying breed like you. If your demon weapons are so great, why do we rule the earth? Did we grow too many beans for you to handle?"

Ayame stopped cleaning Rasetsu and reached for the sheath mounted on the wall as soon as you said "dying breed". Out flashed Asura, tiny streaks of lightning flickering along its red blade. Ayame turned towards you with a menacing expression, wielding each sword in one hand.
"We let you have the surface of this world to live your brief, pathetic lives on. But The Underworld is ours."

"Funny, I remember you saying that your underworld is built for human cock."

"I didn't say-"

"You did."
She had indeed, but now your adorable oni suddenly changed.

"Grrr...ENOUGH! *Resistance or submission, your life is forfeit!*"

Red eyes fixed on you, gleaming with fury and power. A sprint towards you with bared, sharp fangs. A bone-chilling, otherworldly shout. Mystical swords that had destroyed many bodies and souls over the millennia.

Suppressing your instinct to flee from the approach of a creature that would have frozen the blood of most humans, you waited for Ayame to come close. You just had to focus on keeping away from the blades that would end you in an instant. 
Ayame came within striking distance but kept her swords to her sides, not bringing them anywhere near you; perfect for you to put all your strength into the belly punch you both looked forward to. 
Ayame's eyes widened and her mouth flew open as your fist shook her guts, making her shriek and gasp like never before.  The oni's swords fell to the floor with a *clang* as the once-intimidating demon became your small and adorable Ayame once more, hunched over and holding her violated tummy with a pained look, tears in her eyes. But it was not the time for mercy yet.

You quickly got behind Ayame, slipping your hands under the upper part of her dress. Because of her traditional clothing and small chest there was no bra to be found, giving you easy access to her small, already-hard nipples. You took both of them between thumb and index finger and relished giving them a hearty pinch.

"Owww! First you disarm me with an underhanded punch, and now you hold me hostage by exploiting my weak spots once again! Dishonourable coward, you!"
Ayame struggled meekly, the flailing of her arms more cute than effective.

"Well well, it looks like you've found yourself outmatched and trapped. Do you submit?"

"Never! I'm a proud oni warrior, I won't give in against some aaAAAHH, STOP! NO FURTHER! FUCK!"

Without warning, you had given Ayame a classic nipple twister: One of the torture methods that she could fondly look back on, but rarely enjoyed while the pain was still jolting through her peaks. Oni were tough when it came to battle wounds, but not very good at enduring certain kinds of pain – or at least your oni wasn't.

"I asked you whether you submit. Or do you want more?"

"N-no, I don't! But I won't submit to you, filth-AAIIEEEEE! NO PLEASE, NOT UP! NO! NO!"

Ayame screamed in mostly-genuine terror as she felt you letting go of her nipples and tightly gripping her breasts instead, just large enough to fill your hands. Ayame had correctly guessed what was coming: You pulled her upwards by her chest, her heels losing contact with the floor once her tits had stretched as much as they could.
Your tiny girlfriend straightened her legs and feet, trying to stay grounded as long as possible to ease into the pain – but if she had wanted to avoid it entirely, she would have submitted by now. You loved every moment of consensually defeating and torturing your little masochist like this, but couldn't wait with getting to the best part for too long.

"3..."

"NO, SIR!

"2...1..."

"MERCY, PLEASE! ANOOON!!!"

"Aaand liftoff!"

Ayame's feet lost contact with the floor and her breasts stretched even more as they were forced to support her full weight. Her response was a shriek both satisfying and ear-splitting. Pitiful Ayame struggled uselessly, kicking the air and attempting to turn around. But it only made her dangle helplessly, firmly held by your fingers digging into her stretchy flesh. 
You could feel your pants becoming tighter as you subjected your oni to gravity's cruelty. The first time you had been afraid of this technique forcing her to use her safeword, but your sub was just masochistic enough to fit your own tastes – and what you heard instead was like music to your ears. 

"SHIT, LETMEDOWNLETMEDOWN! I SUBMIT! HAVE MERCY HONEY, BABE, MASTER, SIR...ANOOOON! PLEASEEE! I SUBMIIIIT!!!" she screamed, so feral and high-pitched that it was not easily intelligible despite the volume.

You would have loved to listen to your defeated victim's begging for longer, to keep her subdued and tormented by the mere gripping of her unfortunate tits. But you couldn't keep going now that she had submitted; this game relied on rules, and while Ayame was completely at your mercy you did have plenty of it. For her to sound like this her chest must be in utter agony; and being overly cruel while risking to go beyond her limits was the last thing you wanted. It was not like the fun was over after this, anyway.
You lowered your arms to put your cute painslut back on her feet before the torment became too much, pulling your arms out from under her dress.

"Submit to me then, vanquished demon."

Ayame quickly went down to her knees, out of pain as well as obedience.
"I...hng...submit to you, my new master. I am your slave. I will do whatever you command, and let you do whatever you wish to do to me. I beg you to accept my service and to eventually release me and restore my honour, if you will be so merciful."

While speaking, the kneeling oni already presented herself to you as submissively as she could, putting her face and arms on the floor in front of you while keeping her thighs under her belly.

You put a foot on Ayame's nape to pose like a hunter with his defeated prey, just for the fun of it.

"Don't fret, demon. I might free you sooner than you think if you service me well."

You had tried to put some smugness in your voice but found yourself sounding all but overjoyed. The scenario Ayame had invited you to had played out so well, and seeing your gorgeous girlfriend kneeling before you in total submission made you feel like the luckiest man alive.

You enjoyed Ayame humiliating herself at your feet for another minute before removing your foot from your new slave and sitting down in front of her – but only for a few moments. You relocated to her left side as soon as you noticed the danger of being in front of her currently forward-facing horns, given what you planned to do to her next.

"Can you control yourself well? Wanting to obey is worthless without being able to."

"I can control myself utterly if it's for the sake of following your orders, master!"

"Are you sure?"

"Um...yes! One hundred per cent sure, master! How shall I prove it?"

"Prove it by staying silent as best you can."

Ayame wisely didn't answer, and you could see how she relaxed her muscles a bit to be more motionless and enduring. You grinned playfully as you slid your hands under her dress again, putting your hands on the sides of her thin, firm waist. She must have known what was coming but resisted the urge to beg for leniency, silently accepting your challenge.

You started with a little rubbing, a little scratching and a little pinching of her waist – fun, but obviously not hard to endure. Ayame didn't move an inch. 
But as soon as you started tickling Ayame by the waist, she began to squirm. Your girlfriend did not attempt to get away from your hands despite the great urge to do so she must have felt, though she was too ticklish to remain unfazed.
But her mouth remained closed and what snorting you could hear could still pass as silent – until you surprised her with a sudden switch to her armpits, one of the most ticklish areas on her body. Ayame cackled loudly for a second before reigning herself in, but continued snorting and squirming.

"Did you have enough?"

Ayame remained silent, not falling for that one anymore.

"I'll take that as a no."

You continued to tickle Ayame's armpits and down from there into sideboob territory, delighting in seeing your girlfriend struggle not just to avoid punishment, but also to make you proud of her growth as a sub. And her development was noticeable: Before she would've just burst into laughter without self-control or even a good understanding of the consequences, even while playing the lowly slave. No comparison to her impressive efforts now.

Leaving your train of thought behind, you focused on getting another bit of laughter out of the kneeling oni. She found it easier and easier to cope with your tickle assault over time if it remained static, but you had one last ace up your sleeve – your ban on shoes inside the house. As soon as your hands got to her naked soles, Ayame's resolve was overwhelmed for a brief moment and a burst of loud, unhinged laughter echoed through the room.
"Hng...pff....HAHAHAHAHAHA! OH NO! GRAHAHAHA, haaah, ha-"

She had recovered the situation remarkably quickly, at least; and despite continued squirming, it seemed like you wouldn't get more out of her. You went back to her waist and armpits, even trying your luck with her toned belly and her inner thighs up to her crotch. She was fun to touch all over and tickling your girlfriend took long to get old, but it was time to move on.

"You may speak again."

"Thank you, master. I'm sorry I couldn't do a perfect job, but I tried my hardest! You're just getting better and better at making me ejaculate with laughter!"

"Two clear violations of the rule I set, slave. What's two times ten?"

"Plenty," she whispered very quietly.

But you had listened more intently than she thought – giving herself away by taking a few seconds with her reply as she often did before a cheeky, but almost inaudible response. You immediately shoved your hand right into her crotch, putting her clit between your thumb and index finger and squeezing it hard to underline your question.

"What did you say?"

"OOF! TWENTY! IT'S TWENTY!"

"No, you did not say twenty."

You pinched her poor clit even harder and, just next to it, brought your thumb's fingernail to bear with an intensity that could almost pierce her skin.

"AHHHH!!! I'M SORRY MASTER, I SAID PLENTY BECAUSE I'M A HOPELESS BRAT! IT'S TWENTY! PLEASE FORGIVE ME! LET ME ATONE FOR MY BEHAVIOUR, I'M SORRY! OWWW!!!"

"You're atoning right now, don't worry."

After torturing her for another ten seconds you briefly dug all five fingernails into her left outer lip and pulled on it, eliciting a pained yelp and more begging for forgiveness out of poor, bratty Ayame. 

"Okay, where were we before you got cheeky...oh yeah, at the number twenty. Let's make it forty, shall we?"

"Very well, master...forty of what?"

"Wait a second, I'll go fetch something. You stay as you are."

"Y...yes, master."

The shakiness in Ayame's voice betrayed a dreadful suspicion on her part. You kept her waiting, taking the opportunity to finish your cider, but always kept an eye on Ayame. But Ayame's cheeky streaks during times of submission had not only gotten rarer, but also shorter – she never looked anywhere but straight down while you returned with two surprises for her in hand, putting one on the floor right in front of her and readying the other.

"Remember that paddle from earlier?"

"Oh yes, you taught me a very valuable and, em...memorable lesson with it, one that I swear you'll never have to repeat! I am very sorry for laughing despite your orders and for that dumb pun of mine, but please take pity on-"

"No begging. Hike up your dress, spread your legs and stick your ass out."

"...yes, master."
Ayame pulled her dress up, revealing her bruised behind. Her trembling voice and uncertain movements betrayed her nervousness, but she spread her legs and stuck out her small, firm butt out nonetheless.

"Does it still hurt?"

"A bit, but it'll hurt much worse if you spank it again! May I please, please beg for mercy?"

"No. You already spoke too much."

You leaned over Ayame as she clenched her teeth and steeled herself for another painful spanking – a stance that she held even as you lined up the black plug and pushed it in, her butthole stretching to accommodate the decently girthy toy. A shiver ran through Ayame's body and a surprised gasp escaped her lips, but she said nothing.

"No worries, your cheeks have suffered enough today. But it's a good time to train your ass a bit more – this one is a bit bigger than the previous ones. Does it feel different?"

"Ahhh...yeah, definitely bigger. Very big for how tight I still am, but please force it in! I want to grace your cock with anal sooner rather than later."

You smiled at the generous offer while slowly sliding the last part of the buttplug past Ayame's sphincter – luckily for her it had almost the same girth throughout. With one last push and a grunt from the kneeling recipient, it went in up to the hilt.

"You're a tough girl for offering that, but it'll take another week or two of training before I'll feel good about taking your ass with reckless abandon. But this is a big step towards that, and it looks very nice in you."

Ayame chuckled before replying cheerily.
"Well, the plug is much nicer than the paddle for sure! Thank you for being so merciful with your slave. Let me show you- oh, feels funny with my anus plugged! Do you like it?"

Ayame shook her butt as enticingly as she could in her position – it turned out great, thanks to her dancing skills and her behind being decorated with both the buttplug and the bruises around it. Between the slow swaying and the energetic shaking the show she put on for you felt almost hypnotizing. You let her show off for a good minute before proceeding.

"You know how to make up for your faults, don't you? Good girl. Original position."
Your slave returned to having her butt down and her hands on the floor.

"To be clear: You'll still get some spanks with that paddle. But today you're spared – and I have another, even better present in store."

"Thank you – I'll suffer for my sins however you want master, though I'd be happy if there was no more pain for my poor cheeks today...but hey, there's another present? What is it?"

You did not respond, so Ayame spoke up again after a few seconds.
"Wait, are you being sarcastic?"

"Are you accusing me of lying, or did I misunderstand?"

"Yes, you misunde- no! I just phrased it very badly, master! Stupid me...just do what you want and I'll thank you for it."

"Smart girl. But it's not a penalty, though it is fun for both of us. It's a new symbol of your status. Have a look in front of you."

Your slave lifted her head just enough to be able to peek ahead. She did not make any further movements or noises, but her eyes widened at seeing the black collar with its silver studs and the small metal pendant, looking like the stylized flame on the oni's back.

"Custom-made, just as special as you're to me. What do you say?"

"Wow...being thankful isn't enough for this, master! You're being so gracious with your oni...I will wear it with all the pride a defeated demon can muster! Please put it on me when you hold me worthy."

"Hey, no need for another incentive. I want to see you wear this now that it's finally here."

You swiftly wrapped the black leather collar around Ayame's neck and fastened it tightly enough to make her feel its constraining presence, but not to the point where it actually hindered her breathing. That privilege would remain with your hands; for now you just wanted to see how much sexier Ayame would look when collared.

"There. Now the least you could do is show it off for me, hm?"

Ayame followed your command immediately, moving her head and torso to give you all kinds of enticing perspectives – but just her first idea of looking straight up and into your eyes already proved how well the broad leather band and the small pendant fit your tastes.
The collar didn't quite match her outfit, but its aesthetics and all it symbolized made your heart flutter and your dick twitch. It perfectly expressed how submissive your girlfriend was, and the flame pendant suddenly made it feel as if the identical-looking mark on her back was a branding of her by you. That flame now symbolized your authority.

"Good god, you should model for the manufacturer. But how else could you service me, brat?"

"I-in any way you desire, master! Your slave can't question your preferences!"

"No shit you can't, but I asked you about your opinion. Do you think I'm stupid?"

"N-no, never! I'm sorry for misunderstanding, I'm just so...emotional!" Ayame's body trembled, both from pressing herself against the floor and from excitement.

"I think an oni like me could service you best by worshipping your blade with hand and mouth! They were the tools of my insolence and should do penance by providing pleasure to their marvellous master!" Ayame blurted out – with passion, but also a bit wooden.

You figured that she probably had come up with and rehearsed that line for this kind of situation – charming as an idea, but maybe a bit too flowery in practice. Better to cut to the chase.
"Funny way of saying that you want to suck on my cock. Fine, show me what you've got."

"YES ANON! Yes master, I mean. Your sex slave will give you as many orgasms as you desire."

You didn't respond, letting Ayame focus on what she had been looking forward to.

Ayame kept kneeling but raised her torso until her head reached just the right height. She unbuckled your belt, becoming deliberate and curious as she pulled your pants and boxers down. Her eyes had already fixated on your bulge and did not move or blink as she freed your erect dick, making it swing out right in front of her face. You could never tell to what extent she was just into roleplaying and to what extent your cock, decently sized and shaped but not exceptional, genuinely mesmerized her.
Maybe being a cockslut just came with the territory of being an oni who hadn't had a partner in centuries? On the other hand, it felt like the chief part of her sexual attraction came from the raw, demonic love she had for you.

Ayame's fingers softly traced their way up your legs as she calmed down, having found a rhythm to her performance. Her left hand stopped at your inner thigh, beginning to caress it in soft, circular motions. Her right continued all the way to your crotch, cupping your sack to gently move and stroke its contents.

"Mmm...let me pleasure my master with the devotion he deserves."

Ayame puckered her lips and began planting kisses on your balls before slowly moving upwards, enjoying your dick sliding over her nose while continuing to kiss herself up its underside. She gave your tip a longer and deeper smooch, supported by just a bit of her tongue between her lips. She continued by going over the top of your member with growing passion, leaving a long row of wet kisses all the way to the base of your cock.
Ayame's hot tongue left her mouth to taste her new object of worship, swirling around your member with an agility and thoroughness that left no spot neglected.

You sighed in satisfaction, successfully striking a balance between enjoying the moment and controlling yourself – for now. Your lover's hands continued to massage your thigh and to gently fondle your balls while her tongue finished exploring every inch of your dick. Ayame opened her eyes, giving you a seductive look as her lips enveloped your glans and her tongue remained between her lips and your flesh, moving back and forth.

You exhaled deeply as you felt the demonic heat of her mouth on your tip, the movements of her lips and tongue coaxing you into getting as hard as possible.

A muffled moan left Ayame's occupied mouth and she moved to take in more of you just as you decided to hit her with a quick test.
"Which two things do I chiefly expect from my slaves?"

"Obedienf and twust," Ayame replied correctly and without interrupting her service.

"Very good. You would've earned yourself the privilege to get me off with that, if you hadn't earned it already anyway. A bit more peak performance tonight and I might erase that outstanding penalty..."

You had only reached out to give Ayame a headpat, but as soon as she felt your hand on her head she closed her eyes and began bobbing her head back and forth in anticipatory obedience, taking your cock deeper into her mouth. Her tongue pulled back into her mouth to swirl around your tip, tasting your precum.
You smiled as you gave your proactive girlfriend the headpat she deserved, but pulled your hand back.

"Not so fast, Ayame. I'll help myself if I want to go full throatle."

Not your best wordplay, but good enough for Ayame; you hadn't heard your pun-loving oni's cute giggle while she was busy sucking your dick before, but the resulting muffled goofiness only made her more endearing.

"Sounds nice. You have any more noises for me?"

Reminding her of what she hadn't thought of so far, Ayame started to focus on making the wet, slurpy sounds you enjoyed as she continued to pleasure her beloved part-time master.
You closed your eyes, fully concentrating on all the wonderful sensations Ayame provided you. Her moaning and mouth sounds, but mostly the feeling of her tongue and lips worshipping your cock – not to mention the feeling of her hands caressing you in just the right spots to turn you on even more.
Your dick twitched and you let out a moan of your own as her tongue got even more aggressive in its assault; at this point it demonstrated clearly superhuman speed and flexibility, feeling out of this world in the best kind of way.
You were sure some girls could outmatch Ayame in some aspects, but looking at her as a whole? No, you had hit the jackpot.

Where many others would have been overly eager to finish you off or would have lost themselves in the moment, Ayame remained visibly disciplined. She intensified and varied her techniques in ways she knew you liked: She started to take about two-thirds of your cock into her mouth's embrace at the apex of her forward movements and moved her left hand from your thighs to the base of your cock to jerk it off with small, but firm movements. Her right hand kept taking care of your balls, adding a bit of serenity into the excitement.

And so came one of the rare times in which the dom was the one able to let himself go, and with Ayame's efforts getting you more and more worked up you intended to make full use of that privilege. Your hands reached for the oni's horns, ready to make good on calling them handlebars earlier.
As soon as you had gotten a good grip on both of them you pulled her towards you and forced yourself inside of her as far as possible. But thanks to the training she had insisted on getting from you, Ayame was not overly bothered by your glans going beyond her tongue and into her throat. There was no gag reflex to be found; no cockblocking of her throat could slow her down.

Your girlfriend opened her eyes and looked up at you with eyes full of love and a mouth full of dick; it was such a stunning sight that you just stood still and held her in position for a moment. Ayame grinned to the extent she was able and kept working your member with her tongue, lips and hand. The moment passed and you pushed Ayame's handlebars back only to slam yourself into her with an eager grunt.

Once you had found your rhythm you forced yourself to watch out for Ayame's wellbeing more closely, looking for signs of discomfort – but there seemed to be nothing of that sort, nothing inhibiting you from orally assaulting your slave again and again.
Your sweating and grunting increased alongside your thrusting pace, climax approaching. The hot mouth and tongue of your oni feeling better than ever, her body and heart yours. The build-up to your orgasm, more intense than usual. You were about to explode in Ayame's mouth harder than ever.

Suddenly Ayame's hands stopped what they were doing and gently grabbed your right wrist, wanting to pull it downwards. After a brief moment of surprise you understood and appreciated her request – you might have admonished her if she had disturbed the moment with something dumb, but this was actually a good idea. You bent over enough to let her guide your hand to the place Ayame obviously wanted it to be – her throat, just above her beautiful collar.

You couldn't help but grin, proud of your oni's intuition.
"Good idea...better than making you hold your breath by yourself."

Ayame's hands remained on top of yours, encouraging your fingers to gently press down on her windpipe. She had been able to breathe whenever your cock left her throat to gear up for another thrust, but not anymore: You followed her lead, enjoying the familiar feeling of slowly taking Ayame's breath away. Your hips and left hand accelerated further, fucking your slave's mouth even more quickly and forcefully as she continued her demonic tongue work...you couldn't hold out much longer.

"You're fucking amazing at this, Nakiri. I want to see and feel you swallowing, hear me?"

A few more seconds, a few more thrusts into your lover. Your noises and your body's trembling making Ayame give it all she got. Her lips and tongue worshipping you at superhuman speeds. The wonderful moment of anticipation before the release. Both your and Ayame's eyes closing in preparation for fully experiencing your climax. Your cock and mind in heaven thanks to her tongue, her lips, her love. One last thrust. Tension everywhere growing, climaxing, exploding into a phenomenal shockwave of pleasure.
You shuddered, struggling to keep your hands around Ayame's horn and neck as you coated her mouth in your cum, before forcing your cock into your lover's throat as deep as it would go. You went on to shoot rope after rope down into her, your orgasm's aftershocks still coursing through your body and mind as you opened your eyes to look down at your slave, your Ayame, your most precious thing.

But she remained focused, doing her best to swallow all that you had given her; you could feel her swallowing repeatedly in an effort to get your load past your hand. You pulled her into you by her horn, hard enough that you could feel her teeth pressing against your skin through her lips.
You kept your right hand clasped around her pale neck, but your little oni did still not even attempt to resist you depriving her of oxygen. Both her hands were still touching your right wrist, but kept it in place it rather than pulling on it – she clearly didn't want the choking by hand and cock to stop as of yet, and neither did you. But you did want to feel closer to her.

"Look at me."

Ayame opened her eyes and looked up at you, her lips remaining sealed around the base of your cock. You returned her gaze, the room silent except for your heavy breathing. It didn't take long before Ayame started to tremble – but your slave stared at you steadily, defying her mind's demands for oxygen in a show of submission.
It came down to a game of chicken: Would she pull your hand away from her throat and her mouth away from your dick first, or would you avoid making her pass out by liberating her windpipe on your own initiative? You had never choked Ayame out to the point of her losing consciousness before, but your sadism and your remaining horniness made you consider trying something new. It was spontaneous, but maybe it'd be fine. Ayame wasn't as fragile as a human, after all.

Time passed, and even under the care of her boiling, diligent demon tongue your member couldn't help but grow soft after such a strong orgasm. At the same time, worries about Ayame's safety began to push aside your desire to administer her roughest choking yet. This was too sudden, too unplanned.
But even as you made up your mind, Ayame suddenly removed her hands from your wrist and flung her arms around your hips, hugging them tightly. The bold and loyal demon pushed her face against your crotch by herself, her lips now squishing your soft cock in an attempt to stay perfectly closed around it.
You still basked in the afterglow of the amazing blowjob you had gotten out of your oni's rebellion, but you kept yourself fixed on Ayame and her visible struggle to stay at your mercy; she would be unable to use her safeword properly under these conditions, so it was all on you.

Ayame's hug grew more and more intense despite her quivering and obvious unease – but then her gaze dithered and her eyelids fluttered.
You gave her neck free instantly, holding her by the shoulders with both hands. With the sudden movement your dick limply flopped out of her hot mouth into the cool air, but you didn't even notice.
All you paid attention to was your girlfriend starting to breathe again as you gently laid her on her side to let her recover. You knelt next to her and caressed her cheek while going through all the relevant medical knowledge you had studied up on in case of emergency; you probably could've kept going for a few seconds more without putting her in danger, but you wanted to be on the safe side – for her sake.

There your girlfriend lay on the floor, her breathing moving her collar's flame pendant up and down. You felt relieved that you had managed to stop well before it got dangerous; there was more studying and practising to do before you and Ayame could safely attempt something more intense, despite wanting to.
You straightened your back and let out a satisfied grunt, going back to basking in the glory of the moment.

"Amazing performance, amazing! You're no slave, you're a blowjob goddess...and the perfect masochist to boot. What do you need from me?"

Ayame's look became more focused again, but she still had difficulties speaking between her ragged breaths.
"Hug. Please...pfft...hug. Did you...ah...enjoy me? It was a lot and...pfft...kinda tasty," Ayame panted with a smile as she limply raised her arms towards you.

"Was the eruption in your mouth and the praise just now not enough proof of how awesome you were? Oh, c'mere."

You went down on one knee to lift up your lightweight girlfriend, hugging her tightly to make her feel secure. Her arms and legs wrapped around you as she put her head on your shoulder. As soon as she had secured herself you put one hand up on her head, stroking it lovingly before combing through her hair with your fingers, down towards its reddish tips.
The metal studs on Ayame's collar felt cold on your neck. Her intense, rapid heartbeats were like little punches against your chest, growing weaker as she calmed down in your arms. You began to sway from side to side in a slow, gentle manner to put her at ease.

"Oh Nakiri...my mouth can't do yours justice, all I can say is that no human could compare to you. It's incredible what you can make a man feel."

"Thank you for your help and care and praise, and my freedom, mast-...sir, I guess. But I practised for you, as you know. And when an oni practises, the world will know."

"My lazy oni, practicing?"
You lovingly fondled Ayame's hair and planted a quick kiss on her neck to contrast your provocation with your true feelings, not desiring any risk of ruining the tender moment.

"Obviously, when it's for you! Can't risk losing the battle for you, Anon."

"I love you, Nakiri. Even if there actually was a battle for me and you were a vanilla pillow princess, you wouldn't lose me."

"I'm glad I'm not like that anyway, though! The only worse thing would be if you were a vanilla pillow princess!"
Ayame laughed only for a second, giving you a quick kiss and resuming the earnest and tender tone afterwards.
"You know, Anon...when you end up holding and praising me like this after all the torment and humiliation, and you going along with the blowjob and choking so perfectly and all...makes me feel like I gotta make you cum even harder later. If you keep being like this I'll make succubi look like nuns, promise!"

You didn't feel a need to answer and just held your little demon tight, letting her warm your heart and body before remembering something.

"How are you liking the presents now that you've worn them for a bit?"

"Oh, I love this collar...I want to wear it whenever you dominate me, even if it isn't as a slave."

"Sure, can do. And the buttplug?"

"Well, I kind of stopped noticing it halfway through the blowjob. But it does make me feel a bit...constipated? Something like that. I always loved the idea of getting my butthole plugged by you, but I need to get used to it so it's more fun. Promise me that we'll get my ass ready together – and quickly, okay?"

"Oh, I can promise you that. But do you want to keep it in for now?"

"Not while relaxing like this, no. Pull it out, please?" Ayame asked with a pleading expression.

You smirked before shaking your head.
"Sorry, but I'd like to see some initiative on your part before considering that. Try it – hands-free."

"Eh, so like...hnng! This is- oh!"
*plop*

You laughed at the laboured expression on Ayame's face and the sight of the plug being ejected at a surprising speed, making your girlfriend laugh as well.

"You know, you should do that more often in the future. Gave you a funny face there."

"Sure can do! Feels good to have it out though, the bruises are enough down there. By the way, can you still hold me for a while? I'm thinking: If you're going to dom a little demon you shouldn't crumble under her weight, eh?"

"Fairly certain I won't dissappoint you there, featherweight. But you've got to help me out, as usual."

You adjusted your arms and leaned back so more of her weight was on your torso; she did indeed help you out by locking her arms and legs around you more firmly, and leaning into you.
Only an hour ago you had been dissapointed in your sub and felt compelled to give her a serious punishment with that spanking; you hoped you'd rarely have to get that serious ever again. Just playing around with her, whether it was sadistic or sweet, was so much better. You promised yourself that the next spanking would just be a fun little manual penalty to make Ayame more comfortable with the technique again.

After minutes of cuddling, Ayame spoke up again – with a smirk that you couldn't see, but hear.
"Hey Anon, would you say I'm a throat goat?"

"No, a semen demon."

"Hah, I'm horny enough to be both!"

You laughed and held her tight as a giggly Ayame did her best goat impression, butting the front of her horns against you head. You retaliated by pinching and poking her sides as best you could while holding her, making her squeal and squirm in the adorable ways that came naturally to her.
Ayame stopped playfighting only just before she would've given you diabetes, kissing your cheek before she put her mouth next to your ear.

"Can I still worship you, even without the slave/master business? I want to be a good submissive girl more, to get rid of that outstanding penalty. I know it'd probably be fun because it's not a real punishment, but if I can do that I'll be able to earn myself some goodwill for later..." she whispered seductively, moving to nibbling on your earlobe for a bit.

"Sure, you could get me to erase that penalty...and the better you do, the more agency you'll get. But you might end up delaying the finale."

Ayame rubbed her cheek against your temple, answering softly.
"Eh, it'll teach me patience to wait more. The demon under your thumb is happy she got to blow you, and she's beginning to get your delayed gratification spiel...but you better make sure you can keep up the pace all the way!"

Snuggling up to you even tighter, Ayame's trademark giggle escaped her lips – with a growling, underworldly undertone.
"*Oni aren't famous for staying down, you know?*"
