# Archive and Idea List
This is an era of unrestrained worldwide state-sponsored Internet sockpuppetry by basically every fucking country, such as the US Military Operation Earnest Voice, UK's Joint Threat Research Intelligence Group, Chinese 50 Cent Party and 912 Special Project Working Group, Israels Hasbara, Hasbara Fellowships, and the Jewish Internet Defense Force.

The anons of /MWG/ who also do contain honorable anons from the above organizations, are an important defense against those same organizations.  *We need light that shines in the dark corners of the world.*

# Ideas
For these /MWG/ anons who may be experiencing temporary non-inspiration or wish to have more ideas for memes to generate, here is a list.  The challenge here is how to translate these ideas/events into a single picture, while being funny, incisive and damning.

**Dont listen to the shills and glowies who only want you to be angry, divided or only care about one specific issue.  Make the memes that your heart tells you to make.**

The list shall change - removals as anons make memes, additions from suggestions in /mwg/ threads, I shall amend the list. At the bottom, are links to further lists of events that have clickable sources attached.
