# /pol/ Memetic Warfare Archive

This is an era of unrestrained worldwide state-sponsored Internet sockpuppetry by basically every fucking country, such as the US Military Operation Earnest Voice, UK's Joint Threat Research Intelligence Group, Chinese 50 Cent Party and 912 Special Project Working Group, Israels Hasbara, Hasbara Fellowships, and the Jewish Internet Defense Force.

The anons of /MWG/ who also do contain honorable anons from the above organizations, are an important defense against those same organizations.  *We need light that shines in the dark corners of the world.*

# Archive

Archived /mwg/ meme images from threads.  Every /mwg/ meme is included, no matter my own personal preference.
*( Links WILL go down, more are already prepared. Monitor /mwg/ threads for archive mentions. )*

Removals : Images that depict child pornography, real photographs of death and gore, signed artworks, personally identifiable information or copyrighted material not permitted under fair use doctrine are removed. Image removal requests can be submitted in any /mwg/ thread, mention the word archive in your request.

Likewise, generic low-effort mspaint memes and reactions, infographics, duplicates and non related are removed, pngs are converted to jpg.  Remember, these images are humorous works of fiction and only a fool would take them otherwise.  These images are hosted purely for archival and posterity purposes.  These images are also all freely available on alternative archival sites such as 4plebs and archived moe.
