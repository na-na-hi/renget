###Arby's
####59089071 Anonymous: Chicken-Bacon-Swiss
`Chicken-Bacon-Swiss`
I did try the Chicken-Bacon-Swiss at Arby's. The "pepper jack cheese" was very melty and had a texture that made me wonder if it was something that came in a jar like Cheez Wiz and they were spreading it on with a spatula. Not bad, not amazing, kind of wet and drippy. Lots of honey mustard, which either you like or you don't.

###Chick-fil-A
####59136273 Anonymous: Pimento Cheese Sandwich
`Pimento Cheese Sandwich`
I thought I would never get anything from CFA ever again since they're such fag and nigger lovers. That sandwich was fucking amazing. I must really be behind times or something because I don't recall CFA ever having sizable chicken breast for any of their sandwiches. It was juicy and the breading was crunchy. The odd items of pimento cheese, jalapenos, and honey goes really well with it. My only complaint was it didn't have nearly as much pimento cheese like the picture shows, but I guess it was a good enough amount. The meal was $10+ without tax...

####58943121 Anonymous: Chicken Nuggets
`Chicken Nuggets`
Sorta seems like Chick-fil-a actually has the worst chicken nuggets.
I even like Burger Kings nuggets more than CFA.
Shame about the corn though. Haven't been to KFC in ages, but as a kid I remember absolutely loving their corn and mashed potatoes and gravy.
The KFC potatoes and gravy were like crack when I was a kid. I had even fantasies about being a grown up and seeing if I could use grown up money to buy a whole big bucket of just their mashed potatoes and gravy.

They taste fine, great even; but they're very small and a bit dry compared to the rest of their meny, and most importantly they cost way too much for the tiny container you get.
Furthermore these are offered as a meal item, coming with a side and drink.
I've gotten them three whole times thinking it was a fluke the time prior.

I think it's definitely the price vs size and quantity.

#####58944258 Anonymous
Not him. I've had the CFA grilled chicken nuggets. I liked the flavor and texture a lot. They were better than the concept--unbreaded chicken bits somehow cooked on a grill without drying them out, made into finger food--led me to expect. They were spendy, though, and the portion was tiny. I have never had their fried nuggets, though.

#####58951922 Anonymous
>$1.07 per ounce
>$17.12 per pound
This makes full sense for considering them a bad deal, though your post led me to believe there was something wrong with the chicken nuggets themselves rather than it being a pricing issue.
Otherwise, these reviews tell me that Chick-fil-A's nuggets are tasteful even if they are a bit dry.

####56810900 Anonymous: #1 Chicken Sandwich
`#1 Chicken Sandwich`
Speaking of chicken. There are now two locations about 25-ish miles from me, in different towns. I decided to stop in one this week, as I was already in the area. I had the basic #1 chicken sandwich, which was okay but not amazing. It's just a piece of white chicken meat, battered, fried, and put on a bun with pickles. The grilled chicken tenders were nice, though, if expensive--$6 for a tiny potion. The lemonade is made from actual fruit and there is lemon pulp in it, which I did not expect. I would go back just for the lemonade and maybe the grilled tenders. Or maybe I should try a different sandwich.

###Chicken Guy
####56811919 Anonymous: Peri-peri Chicken Sandwich
`Peri-peri Chicken Sandwich`
Speaking of sammiches. This one was from a chain supposedly owned by Guy Fieri. It was two largish chicken tenders on a bun with lettuce, tomato, onion, and pickles. The chicken was tender, the bun and toppings were fresh, and that part was all perfectly okay. The "peri-peri sauce" was okay but tasted nothing like real peri-peri. Peri-peri is supposed to be made out of African birdseye peppers, which are supposedly the same species as Thai prik-ki-nu peppers, and also supposedly grow wild in Mexico, where people call them "chiltepins." They're tiny little things, about a quarter of an inch across, and about as hot as habaneros. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsicum_annuum_var._glabriusculum Peri peri sauce is made from these peppers, plus garlic, lemon juice, cilantro, and a bit of smoked paprika. This stuff was the right color but made of sweet red bell peppers and lacked all but the tiniest trace of heat--not a bad sauce at all but not what the name led me to expect. The next time I am in the area, if I am hungry, I want to try again and see if the habanero sauce has some snap to it.
I am, however, an old chili head, and maybe my palate is burnt out. I want to see if I can make something like peri peri out of the orange habanero peppers supermarkets here have. It will be the wrong color, but maybe it will taste okay. something something two pounds of peppers, a dozen cloves of garlic, a big bundle of cilantro, juice and zest of a lemon, dash smoked paprika, salt and pepper to taste, process to a uniform pulp in a food processor, half is marinade for a whole cut-up chicken, in which it sits overnight in a covered glass bowl, then cooks an hour or so at 400, in a foil-lined pan with the used marinade poured over the chicken. The rest of the sauce is kept aside, poured over the chicken it before serving.

###Culver's
####58915157 Anonymous: Spicy Chicken Sandwich
`Spicy Chicken Sandwich`
its alright, better than the main competition like kfc and popeyes for sure, but its kinda overpriced. it was $6 iirc and it didnt take too long to finish and the chicken was kinda thin, not a whole lot of meat. the use of shredded lettuce is preferable im0. its not the usual tasting fried chicken that popeyes and kfc and burger king use but its not as good as chicfila. id rather go to chicfila bc im looking at the prices and a spicy deluxe at chicfila is $4 while the inferior culvers spicy chicken sandwich alone is $6, definitely not worth it. i also added my own sauces and that definitely added to the taste, idk what their sauces taste like.
id put it in between burger king and chickfila, being closer to burger king on the scale. but its way overpriced for what it is

###KFC
####58943018 Anonymous: Chicken Nuggets
`Chicken Nuggets`
Also, I went out to run some errands and stopped at a KFC on the way home. Today I decided to try the chicken nuggets. They were hot and fresh, with a nice juicy texture and just enough breading, and the breading was well seasoned. The counter guy said they came with dipping sauces, and all of them had self-evident names other than "KFC Sauce," so of course I tried it. It has a very very strong horseradish odor and a bit of a reddish color, like maybe there's paprika or even cayenne pepper in it. It's honey mustard, but honey mustard with a sharp piquant horseradish bite to it, and it will clear your sinuses. It isn't bad, and I say that as someone who doesn't generally like honey mustard. It seems less excessively, cloyingly sweet than other honey mustard some other chains have. I was a bit disappointed that KFC doesn't have corn on the cob any more and their current side dishes all seem to be deep-fried, really starchy or sugary, or all at once. No pictures today but we all know what chimken numget look like.

####58070643 Anonymous: Spicy Chicken Sandwich
`Spicy Chicken Sandwich`
After running some errands this afternoon, I stopped at a KFC on the way home. I had the spicy chicken sandwich.
The sandwich was bigger than I expected, with what looked like an entire split boneless chicken breast. It is, of course, battered and fried, on a kaiser-ish sort of roll. This particular sandwich comes with dill pickles and a secret spicy dressing that looks and tastes like ranch dressing with hot sauce mixed in.
Not amazing, not horrible. It was sufficiently filling that I don't think I'll eat anything else this evening. The fries were the usual seasoned fries, very much like you'd find in any other fast food place. I think it was okay, and the combo came to $8.79 with local sales tax. Nothing about this was amazing, but I don't feel ripped off.

###McDonald's
####59119870 Anonymous: McDonald's Spicy Chicken
`McDonald's Spicy Chicken`
mickey deez spicy chicken
it was decent, its the same chicken they use for their biscuits and mcgriddles. slightly on the more expensive side at 4.79. for just the sandwich. it had more meat than culvers and it was a 1.20 cheaper and it tasted better so id say it was pretty good value wise. i probably need to stop getting the spicy option as thats too subjective imo. mcdonalds did not scimp on the spicy sauce they use. id rather the spice be cooked into the chicken but the sauce was p good, some mayo mixture i reckon. the downside of using spicy sauce vs cooking the spice into the chicken is that its messier for one, and the sauce gets on your lips, naturally. but this means your lips get all hot and its annoying imo. the bun wasnt super happy and was squished, probably while being put into its bag. this is probably fine being that it was made at mcdonalds and they have to get food out fast. overall it was pretty good

####59114157 Anonymous: Filet-O-Fish & Quarter Pounder with Cheese
`Filet-O-Fish & Quarter Pounder with Cheese`
Alright, I'm gonna review the Quarter Pounder with cheese and the Filet of Fish.

The quarter pounder with cheese is THE classic. This neat, juicy sandwich leaves you with a greasy, sweet aftertaste that tears the anus out of even the sweetest candies. Every bite is a chomp, and this unforgiving sandwich will pass through you in chomps too, you WILL feel this sandwich in you. Despite this, it is not truly a quarter pounder. Like it says on the box, this handheld weighs 4 ounces before it's cooked, yet after eating it I somehow gained 4 entire pounds. Crazy how McScience works, huh? The McDonald's McResearch team has devoted millions of dollars to making a more sustainable sandwich, sustainable without the sus, as you're still eating the same 100% beef. As the saying goes, the west is hungry, and billions must dine!

The Filet of Fish kills sloppy joes, beheads sloppy joes, and roundhouse kicks their sauciness into the concrete. Seriously, the Filet of Fish is moist, true to it's origins, and the McDonald's McTartersauce that lathers the McFishslab inside of it will line your mouth in creamy, savory goodness. Not only is this food stack bigger than The Quarter Pounder, but it's more filling, and for a fraction of the price. Despite making up less than 15% of Mickey D's sales, this absolute slapper commits to your taste buds about 50% more than other McDonald's sandwiches. This sandwich will make you associate your girlfriend's fishy scent with a hearty, true-to-the-table meal, with a McCoca-Cola to make it all come down your throat.

While The Quarter Pounder with cheese is THE Macca's classic, you can't deny that the Filet of Fish beats it out of the water. A newer, meatier sandwich for a fraction of the price? Sounds impossible, but McDonald's has it, and in my opinion, it's a hidden gem.

####59090055 Anonymous: McRib
`McRib`
The McRib is less a sandwich than a meme they re-release every few years because all the cable TV news talking heads give them hours and hours of free advertising by talking about it. The mechanically formed slug of mystery meat is not in and of itself horrible but it is drowned in a sugary, sugary, sugary sauce that seems to be an attempt to convert it into candy. A less sweet, more savory sauce (try tomato paste +
apple cider vinegar + sweet basil + just a few drops of liquid smoke seasoning, salt, pepper, garlic, paprika, and maybe a tad of cayenne pepper, to taste) would improve it quite a bit. As it is, it is maybe the canonical example and the picture in the dictionary when you look up "mediocre fast food." Foxes are obligate carnivores and even they aren't enthusiastic about the McRib.

###Popeye's
####58200065 Anonymous: Spicy Chicken Sandwich
`Spicy Chicken Sandwich`
Earlier this week, I stopped at a Popeye's on the way home from my workout. They were out of the blackened chicken sandwiches I wanted to try, so I had the "Spicy." It was a bit more expensive and a bit smaller than the KFC spicy chicken sandwich. It had some nice dill pickle slices on it. The sauce seemed like it was mostly hot sauce with a dab of ranch dressing stirred in, and was also really, really salty. All in all I preferred the KFC product.
It wasn't horrible, and the red beans and rice I ordered on the side was pretty good.

wawa chicken parm hoagie
it was pretty alright, it filled me up pretty good considering i didnt have breakfast and i ate it for lunch while at work. for 7.99, its pretty good value for a fast way to be not hungry anymore. it was pretty messy and the sauce quickly made the bread soggy, which could be negated by toasting the bread, this however wasnt an option sadly. it could also be considered "fast food" so i guess it gets a pass for the messiness. the mozzarella and parmasan tasted ok and the sauce the same, it isnt exactly olive garden but its not the worst.

`Maple Bacon Chicken Croissant Sandwich`
The sandwich itself was about $4.

So, yeah, it's still pretty damned good, but I thought it would've been sweeter. The sauce consists of the same shit as the butter and syrup packets you get for typical fast food breakfast, nothing too special there. Has bacon... and it was crispy. Everyone loves bacon except kikes and sand niggers, right? The chicken had nice crispy breading to it even after the sauce melting into it. The chicken itself was an actual cut of chicken breast that was tender enough and as good as their other chicken sandwiches that have that. Honestly, I prefer Wendy's chicken over something like Chic-fil-a. Cheaper, just as good if not better, and don't have to deal with retardly long lines just to overpay for some fast food. Oh, and the croissant that housed the chicken, bacon, and sauce? Idk, it's just a fast food croissant man, flaky and chewy.

It's good af and all, but I think one could make something better themselves. Surely one could just prepare their own breaded chicken breast or buy some frozen chicken tenders that are lightly breaded, get some croissants from a grocery bakery, use actual butter, and pour on some maple syrup of choice to make this sandwich. Sounds better already. Geez, I haven't really done much of this writer kinda shit since I was in school years ago... Sorry lol.

Overall, I recommend giving it a try.

####58919026 Anonymous: Rotisserie Chicken
`Rotisserie Chicken`
Walmart rotisserie chicken is shockingly good, when you consider that Walmart is mainly known for selling cheap sneakers, cheap socks and underwear, and cheap hand tools made in China. In the Midwest there is a supermarket/department store mashup chain called Meijer that also has surprisingly good rotisserie chicken, for a place that's essentially the ghetto local competitor to Walmart.

Kroger rotisserie chicken is okay but about ten years back every time I got any kind of cooked chicken product in a Kroger deli, in several stores in an area about fifty miles across, every single time it was bright red bloody raw in the middle. Fried chicken, rotisserie chicken, chicken tenders, whatever. It really put me off their deli products. Maybe I should give them another chance. I've moved to another area and there's a Kroger every few miles. Kroger has cooked ribs in the deli that are well seasoned, especially the seasonal stuff like "Hatch pepper seasoned ribs," but they're chewy as FUCK. They're cooking them too fast at too high a temperature, I think, but I understand that they're making this stuff to sell to the public and they need to put it out in volume with the equipment and staff that they have, so they can't really put them on the smoker and go low and slow and tell the customers "come back tonight at nine."

Farmer Jack had good rotisserie chicken and a good deli, and it's a shame they went under.

There's another Midwestern supermarket chain called Busch's, that seems to be trying too hard to be "affluent" and "high end." They also have good stuff in the deli, but it tends to be spendy enough that you don't see a lot of ghetto goblins inside.

Weirdly, I haven't had chicken in several days. I should thaw some more out this weekend.

#####59080339 Anonymous: Chicken with Adobo Seasoning
Yesterday evening I sprinkled some chimken with off-brand adobo seasoning I got at a Big Lots and baked it. Foil lined covered pan. Start with cold oven, put food in, turn to 400, hour and twenty minutes. I think it came out okay. Some would say I overcook chicken a bit, but it didn't dry it out, and I want to be sure it's fully cooked. The proteins in poultry--seafood too--are more readily broken down by common bacteria than the proteins in beef, and bacteria can grow and spread very rapidly on them. So I try to be very cautious and always either use or freeze chicken immediately after buying it, and always cook it very, very thoroughly. It came out saltier than I expected. This spice mix must have more salt in it than I thought it did. But it was okay, and most of the fat drained out of it as it cooked. Lining the pan with foil greatly simplifies cleanup, and I am a lazy, lazy man.

We /ck/ nao. When you get a seasoning mix like that, shake the container. If the contents feel light and fluffy in spite of the container being full, then it is all or mostly herbs and spices. Salt is much denser and a mix that is high in salt will feel heavy by comparison. If you shake the container and it feels like it's full of ball bearings, then the contents are mostly salt. This is not a bad thing in and of itself, but know what you're working with, know what you're buying. When you cook for fox gf, she'll thank you.

What would you cook for fox gf? Fried chicken, I suppose. Or hard boiled eggs.

#####58729062 Anonymous: Chicken Parmigiana
When I was much, much younger, I worked in a few different restaurants. The typical chicken parmagiana recipe was something like:

flattened chicken breast
coating (can be batter, egg-and-milk wash + bread crumbs, flour, even rolled in cornmeal)
deep fry to render the chicken fully cooked and the coating crisp and golden brown
put on a steel broiler platter
coat top surface with tomato sauce of some kind (can be marinara sauce, arrabiata, even pizza sauce)
cheese goes on top (usually shredded mozzarella, parmesan, or a mixture, but you can find places using anything from asiago to provolone)
put under gas broiler to melt the cheese and begin to brown the melted cheese just a little on the high spots

Typically it's served with a salad and a portion of a pasta dish.

Also works on sliced eggplant, zucchini, pounded veal cutlet, etc.

I wonder whether focks would appreciate Italian food.

#####58728832 Anonymous: Thin Parmesan Chicken
Basically Parmesan chicken, but instead you cut thigh meat into thin slices.
Mix the mayo, Italian style bread crumbs, and Parmesan cheese like normal, but then put your thin slices onto a cookie tray with generous butter and top with a thin layer of the parmesan crusting.
Bake @350 degrees farenheit until the top is brown.
Eat them like potato chips.

#####56812358 Anonymous: White Chicken Chili
Okay. This is off the top of my head and is maybe less a recipe than a set of heuristics that point in a chili-ish direction. Try:
one pound of boneless chicken thighs. Cut them up. The dark meat is more flavorful than the white meat, that's why.
A couple tablespoons of bacon grease, if you have some. If not, butter or any cooking oil will do.
One medium sized onion, minced finely. I like to use a "mandolin" style slicer, then chop up the thin slices.
Four to six jalapeno peppers, cut into thin round slices. The "mandolin" type slicer is good for this too.
Two peeled cloves of garlic and a garlic press. You will press the garlic into the chili but don't squeeze it yet.
Half a cup of flour.
Half a cup of fine cornmeal, the kind they call "harina de maiz" or "masa harina" in Mexican grocery stores. If you can't get it, regular cornmeal.
One 14 tg 15 ounce can of cooked white canneloni beans, navy beans, or similar, because chicken chili is white.
Salt and pepper to taste. And a teaspoon of chili powder, or to taste.
Once the chicken, onions, and peppers are cut up, start heating the oil or grease in the bottom of a big Dutch oven or casserole pan. This is gonna be a one-pot dish. While the oil is heating coat all the pieces of chicken thoroughly with the flour and when the oil is hot, put the coated chicken pieces, one or two at a time, into the oil. We want to brown them all a bit on the outside, caramelize that flour a bit. As they're all getting brown, add the onions and peppers, and brown them too. You will want to move them around with a wooden spoon for this. When the onions are caramelized, add the canned beans and the seasonings. Stir thoroughly, get all the chicken pieces coated with it. Bring it to a boil, but be careful to stir it frequently. Don't let it scorch. Whisk the cornmeal in a bit at a time and then put the cover on the pan, put it in the oven, and simmer it four hours at 275. Serve with cornbread and green beans.

Oh. Use the garlic press to mash the garlic and press it into the chili when you add the salt, pepper, and chili powder. It generally comes out looking something like this when it's done, but with jalapeno slices. Depending on your tolerance for capsaicin, minced green bell pepper is a permissible substitution. And all the seasonings can be adjusted up or down for your preferences. I might go up to a tablespoon of chili powder in something like this, but I know there are people who would react badly to more than a pinch.

Hey guys, its Bible Study time.
Open your Bibles to Genesis 1.
>"In the beninging. In the benin...In the beningi...In the benignig..."
Just kidding.
Open your Bibles to the New Testament, Matthew 25:14.
I will now read to you all the Parable of the Talents.

>For it will be as when a man going on a journey called his servants and entrusted to them his property;
>to one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one, to each according to his ability. Then he went away.
>He who had received the five talents went at once and traded with them; and he made five talents more.
>So also, he who had the two talents made two talents more.
>But he who had received the one talent went and dug in the ground and hid his master’s money
>Now after a long time the master of those servants came and settled accounts with them
>And he who had received the five talents came forward, bringing five talents more, saying, ‘Master, you delivered to me five talents; here I have made five talents more.’
>His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a little, I will set you over much; enter into the joy of your master.’

>And he also who had the two talents came forward, saying, ‘Master, you delivered to me two talents; here I have made two talents more.’
>His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a little, I will set you over much; enter into the joy of your master.’
>He also who had received the one talent came forward, saying, ‘Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not winnow;
>so I was afraid, and I went and hid your talent in the ground. Here you have what is yours.’
>But his master answered him, ‘You wicked and slothful servant! You knew that I reap where I have not sowed, and gather where I have not winnowed?
>Then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have received what was my own with interest
>So take the talent from him, and give it to him who has the ten talents.
>For to every one who has will more be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away.
>And cast the worthless servant into the outer darkness; there men will weep and gnash their teeth.’

Parables are pictures of moral truth; they make spiritual principles visible and vivid. In this parable we have sharply outlined before us
and impressed upon the fact that all our gifts and goods are bestowed upon us as stewards that we may put them to there right use and
for which we shall be held accountable.
Life is not simply pleasure, but it is business, even the Lord's business and should be conducted. Five talents, two talents, one talent...such are the differences in the endowments and opportunities of people. Men differ in talents from idiocy to genius, from pauperism to plutocratic wealth, from narrow circumstances to the widest opportunities from native coarseness and viciousness disposition to spirituality of temperament. These differences in men are the roots of the many differences
outside of men, the inequalities of society that often present such frightful aspects and sorely perplex our minds and burdens our hearts.
The human mind starts as a tiny germ, but it may be developed into the philosopher's intellect that weights the earth and measures the stars. Whatever maybe one's mental outfit he can expand it indefinitely in power and service.

A dull boy cannot become a genius, but he may train his slow intellect into a more rapid pace and surprising power, and then turn his
talent into two or ten.
Truth grows by trading, the exchange of thought the useful employment of the knowledge we have when we invest our truth, teaching it
to others or turning it to practical service; it immediately begins to grow clearer in our own minds and to widen out it's boundaries,
and this is multiplies its talent.
Faith, purity, patience, gentleness, unselfishness, love, all spiritual faculties and fruit grow in the same way. It often takes a long time to develop talents and the Lord gives us plenty of time.
We must not expect to reach rapid results and grow impatient at slow processes. The acorn it takes summers and winters to do it. But however long may the Lord delay His coming, he is sure to come at last and call His savants to account.
God Himself is continually investing His own talents and making new seeds grow in your life.

Some Bible study:

Adam & Eve, when they ate the fruit, brought the curse of death on the whole World. The 'curse of death' essentially being Satan's 'license to kill'.

However, Jesus Christ - The Sinless Man, the curse of death should (by law) have never touched him. The death of Christ dammed Satan (because he committed murder), and bought freedom for mankind.

>44 Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.
John 8:44

>31 Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out. 32 And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.
John 12:31-32

>26 Jesus answered, “It is the one to whom I give this morsel after I have dipped it.” Then He dipped the morsel and gave it to Judas son of Simon Iscariot. 27 And when Judas had taken the morsel, Satan entered into him. Then Jesus said to Judas, “What you are about to do, do quickly.”
John 13:26-27

>I will no longer talk much with you, for the ruler of this world is coming. He has no claim on me,
John 14:30

>11 Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.
John 16:11

>16 By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire.
Ezekiel 28:16

>10 And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.
Revelation 12:10

Not revalations but next best thing
Judges 15:3-5
Samson then said to them, “This time I shall be blameless in regard to the Philistines when I do them harm.” Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took torches, and turned the foxes tail to tail and put one torch in the middle between two tails. When he had set fire to the torches, he released the foxes into the standing grain of the Philistines, thus burning up both the shocks and the standing grain, along with the vineyards and groves.
