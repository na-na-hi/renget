Grunting and heavy panting echoed off the cracked concrete walls all around them, filtering and distorting down dusty, empty passages to all sides. A muttered curse word, a caught breath, the flat ‘pat pat’ sound of flesh striking flesh. Grunt’s hands tightened on the hips he was holding, his breath coming in rapid gasps as he pounded away.
 
Being on Tuchanka full time had been an interesting change of pace for the young Krogan. He’d visited his race’s homeworld of course, to fulfil his Rite of Passage, but that was almost a year ago now. The Omega Relay had been run, the Collectors taken a rhetorical claw hammer between the legs, and the day had been saved. Now his old commander was off trying to make the human high command see reason, and he’d been sent back to join the Urdnot military proper.
 
He’d come back to the irradiated dustball to find quite a few breeding requests waiting for him, in recognition for his stunning heroism beyond the legendary Omega relay, and he’d spent several very pleasant days in the female camp with female after female, giving them each a taste of what a pure specimen like him could do. But eventually that flurry of mating had come to an end and he’d staggered back to the Urdnot compound to settle in.
 
His first exposure to Clan Urdnot downtime had come when going to the storehouse to grab some more thermal clips for his next recon OP, only to hear grunting and smacking from one corner of the building. Too quiet for a fight, he wasn’t sure what to make of it, and crept over to investigate. Far from some kind of battle, he’d found a pair of the recon scouts, both very much male, mating with each other. One taking the role of a female, the other ploughing his cock up the other male’s ass with every sign of enjoyment, bending his partner over a storage crate.
 
Not sure what to make of this, he’d swallowed his pride and asked Wrex, who laughed heartily at the question before taking pity and explaining. While such things were taboo in some clans, Urdnot recognized that males had certain needs, and with the females being so difficult to access, they sought their release with each other. With private space at a premium inside the perimeter, you generally found an interested male, found some secluded spot to bump quads, and hopefully not be interrupted while busy.
 
At first, Grunt wasn’t sure what to make of it, but soon enough he felt a familiar restless energy, and his dreams started to fill with phantom images of the females he’d bedded, and he would wake with his shaft had and needy each morning. He’d watched a few hookups happen, in the communal showers, in the bar, at the Varren pit. So one day he walked up to a prospective warrior and imitated what he’d seen others do, repeating the same words he’d heard others say. Giving him a small surprise, the other male had nodded his assent, and they’d found a store room to fuck in for a pleasant hour or so. Grunt quickly found that Krogan males were every bit as tight and warm and pleasant as Krogan females. From behind there was almost no difference, a pair of meaty hips to hold and a nice hole to pound into, and soon he was enjoying himself immensely.
 
So it came that, about a month after living on Tuchanka full time, here he was, down some dusty utility corridor near the Urdnot defense perimeter, ploughing the ass of one of the technicians who maintained the automated defense guns. He’d been patrolling the wall idly that morning, hoping for some Pyjaks to shoot, and the tech had idly mentioned that the gun was on diagnostic cycle, and he had a free half hour, if Grunt might want to stay. The tech had given him a knowing smile and nodded to a nearby door.
 
“Oh…. Fuck, Grunt!” The tech gasped out as Grunt rammed him again and again from behind, the tech’s hands braced against the wall, showing every sign of enjoying what he was getting.
 
Truth be told, Grunt didn’t know what must be going through his partner’s head, to enjoy imitating a female like this, but evidently he did enjoy it and either way it felt good for Grunt, so he didn’t much care. As long as there were plenty of males willing to play act as females, he was content, his quad not much caring whether it was a male or female ass it emptied into.
 
He felt a familiar tightness in his quad again, his pace picking up as he hammered hard and fast into the other male, before he slammed hard home and groaned as his pleasure peaked. Copious amounts of warm, thick seed were pumping from his shaft into the tech’s backside, some spilling back out to run down his thighs. The tech gasped a moment later, one hand feverishly stroking his own cock, as his own seed was splashed against the wall, painting it white. Hanging his head, the tech seemed quite spent and satisfied, but Grunt wasn’t so overcome to not hear the one low chuckle behind him.
 
He looked sharply over his shoulder, seeing another Krogan in the hall behind them. His armor was as scarred as his crest was, a deep burnt orange color, so darkened with age in some places to seem almost black. Some males might be sheepish to be caught with their pants down, but Grunt just pulled out of his companion and half turned towards the older male. His cum coursed down the gun tech’s thighs, Grunt’s own cum stained member half hard, the young warrior giving the elder a defiant look, as if proudly showing off how he’d wrecked his fellow’s ass.
 
Grunt expected the other male to either back down, or rise to the challenge of his defiance. He wasn’t expecting the old male to give him a bemused grin and a knowing little shake of the head before turning down another passageway and out of sight. His thoughts a little troubled, Grunt wiped his cock clean and put his armor back on, leaving the gun tech to clean himself up.
 
It was afternoon, several hours after his morning tryst, and Grunt’s mind was still troubled. True, he hadn’t been doing anything wrong, yes at some point everyone got walked in on, and no, nobody in the clan would think twice about him rutting a willing partner against a wall. But there was something in that knowing look and bemused smirk that he couldn’t quite work out of his memory. Grunt growled to himself and tromped off towards the showers. Maybe he could scrub these thoughts away as easily as he did wasteland dust, or maybe he’d be lucky enough to find another hookup. It had only been a few hours since the last one, but somehow, finding someone to rut seemed as good a way to affirm himself as any.
 
He quickly stripped off his armor and hit the showers, turning on the hot water and just standing there for a moment, stewing, hearing the distant sounds of other Krogan in another part of the baths or heading around outside. Most either bathed in the morning or the evening, so it was pretty empty right now, but maybe he could find someone to… He heard footsteps behind him and turned to see a familiar face. The orange shelled elder came in, as naked as Grunt himself, heading for another shower head. He paused for a moment to give Grunt a look, eyes moving with shameless curiosity over the younger male’s form, lingering for a moment on his toned behind. The older male gave him a little grin and a tiny nod.
 
Grunt rolled his shoulders and huffed, turning back to his shower, facing away from the elder to hide his momentary expression of confusion. He’d seen it happen often enough in these very showers, done it himself plenty of times. Giving another’s ass a good leer was as obvious a way to signal interest as any, to silently probe if they might be willing to offer you said ass. Grunt had been on the receiving end of such a look twice, the first time he’d just glared back and the other had gotten the message. The second time a headbutt had been required to make it clear he was not interested in playing female. There had not been a third time. But this elder’s look was not so… obviously dirty. It was approving, appreciative, but it didn’t have that hungry side to it.
 
“You that worked up over one look pup?” the older male asked in a deep, rumbling voice. No humor or edge of insult, his voice was warm and friendly, relaxed even.
 
“Wha?” Grunt half turned, seeing the elder steadily washing himself, faced away from him. It struck him how much larger the older male was. No Krogan towered over Grunt, but this old male was noticeably the bigger. “I’m not worked up.” He said crossly.
 
The other male chuckled, a noise like boulders grinding together. “I gave you one little look and you’ve been standing there for five minutes staring at the wall. You sure you’re okay pup?”
 
Grunt bristled a little at being called ‘pup’, even though the term did slightly strange things to his insides each time it was spoken. Not like the friendly mockery of Wrex calling him ‘whelp’, there was an admiring affection in the term that Grunt wasn’t used to. “I don’t play at being a female, so don’t ask.” He said brusquely, starting to scrub his plates roughly.
 
The old male chuckled again, turning enough to look back at him. “Good. Because you’re not a female. Nor are any of us in this camp… nor was that gunner you were making a mess of earlier.”
 
Grunt stopped scrubbing again and shot the old Krogan a look, clear blue eyes meeting deep orange. “What are you talking about? He was… I took him as I would a female.”
 
The old Krogan snorted, turning around to lean his back against the wall, letting the water cascade over his body. Powerful muscles and ancient, craggy plates. “Maybe that’s why you’re so sloppy. You’re treating your partners like entirely the wrong thing. That one you were rutting was a male, who enjoyed having another male on his back, not a male who liked pretending to be female. I’m as male as you are and I’ve taken plenty of males, and enjoy laying with males and females.”
 
Grunt opened his mouth, then closed it again. He rolled his shoulders awkwardly, processing it. He’d thought he had things pretty clearly figured out. Males enjoyed mating with females, and when there were no females, each other. He’d always just considered the receiving male to be pretending to be female but… This seemed to complicate things. Genuinely enjoying mating with other males, as more than a substitute? And this old one seemed to imply that he had been in both roles, giver and taker. Grunt had emptied his quad into so many different males, and he’d never considered if they themselves did the same to others. Part of him just assumed they were always on the receiving end, but weren’t they?” A chuckle drew him out of his thoughts, the older male shaking his head.
 
“Hehe, lost in thought again pup? It’s not that complicated is it?” The elder chuckled. “Did nobody really explain this to you?”
Grunt scowled and turned around, going back to washing himself. No, not really, he thought to himself. The tank voice of Okeer only explained about breeding, and Wrex only said it was a pastime without females, and he hadn’t considered it any further than that. “Pretending or not, I’m still not interested in doing it. It’s not what I like.” He said firmly. At least, he thought it was firmly.
Another knowing chuckle. “How can you know if you’ve never felt it? Most enjoy both ways enough to switch up sometimes… even Wrex.”
Grunt turned jerkily towards the elder, surprise evident. “Wrex? He…” He gestured vainly in the air.
 
The old male grinned and nodded. “It’s how he prefers to be with a male, actually.” He explained casually. “If he wants to plough a warm hole he’s never wanting for female company. But there’s pleasures only another male can give him, so when he lays with one of his fellow males he prefers to receive. Hehe, he can be very… demanding.”
 
Grunt’s eyes widened a little. “You have…” He considered his words carefully, not wanting to be insulting to his clan leader. “Er… taken Wrex?” He still couldn’t believe it. Unbidden, the image of this powerful, ancient male pounding into a groaning Wrex entered his mind. He shook his head a bit to dispel it.
 
The old male chuckled again. “A few times. I won’t divulge the details, you’d have to ask him for that. But I never left him unsatisfied… I never leave any of my partners unsatisfied.”
 
Grunt turned to face the wall again, shaking his head. “Well I’m not… unsatisfied with my own way. So… thanks for explaining, but I’m not interested.”
 
For such a big male, he moved alarmingly quietly, because when he spoke again his low, rumbling voice was near Grunt’s ear, warm breath on his neck. “You seem pretty interested, pup. You still have so much to learn.”
 
Grunt stood rigid, one hand clenched into a fist, staring firmly at the wall, telling himself he wasn’t interested, that this wasn’t what he was into, that there had to be some other explanation for the cock rising from his sheath. That the knowledge that Urdnot Wrex, mightiest and most respected of any clan leader on Tuchanka liked relieving his stress by getting fucked up the ass by the very male now breathing on his neck.
 
“Like…” He asked, mouth suddenly dry. “Like what?”
 
The old male grinned over his shoulder. One hand reached up and gripped a place just above his hip, thumb finding a small gap between the plates. Grunt was about to ask what he was doing when that thumb pushed hard into the soft flesh beneath the plates and several things happened very fast. It felt like electric current was shooting from the base of his spine up to his brain. His back arched, his eyes popped wide as dinner plates, his mouth went open into a surprised, ‘ah!’ in a higher pitch than he normally spoke in. As fast as it shot up to his brain the spark seemed to go back down to his waist, into his cock, which pulsed and slid, half hard from his sheath. His right leg spasmed and trembled and he suddenly lost balance, tipping to one side. He reached for something to grab and stop his fall, but before he could the hand slipped from his waist to wrap an arm around his chest, the male’s left hand going to rest on his outer thigh.
 
Grunt looked up, eyes still wide, into the knowing smile of the older male who was currently holding him up, pressed against his back. Grunt’s breath was coming in short gasps, and his racing mind wondered if he was going to be taken right there. But no thrust came. In fact, he didn’t even feel the poke of a shaft on his back.
 
“Catch your breath and think about it, pup.” The old male said, giving him a little squeeze. “If you’re still interested, come and find me in the bar this evening. Ask for Jax.” The old male gave him one last look, then set him on his feet again and left. Grunt watched him leave, then looked down to see his own rock hard erection. He stood there for quite some time, not knowing what exactly had just happened, but eventually realizing that he didn’t actually regret it at all.
 
It had been a couple hours since Grunt had finished his shower. With nothing to do, he had dressed and meandered aimlessly around the compound. He passed the Varren pit, browsed aimlessly at the gun kiosk before wandering off, spent a while staring out over the windblown sands of the wasteland beyond the compound’s broken concrete walls. Truth be told he was just going wherever his feet were leading him, unable to really concentrate on anything. His mind constantly returned to the encounter with Jax in the showers, to the feel of that warm breath on his neck, calloused hands gripping him and holding him up. His hand twitched and he looked around shamefully, before he reached back to probe gingerly at the spot that Jax had pushed to make him melt. Nothing happened, must be some special trick to it.
 
In one short conversation his simplistic worldview had been turned upside down and thrown away. This morning the world had made sense, there was an order and rationale to things. Now he lived in a world where Urdnot Wrex took it up the ass and he, Grunt, purest of all Krogan, had been reduced to a panting, gasping pile at the touch of another male. A male who seemed to always be hovering over his shoulder now, Grunt constantly expecting to hear his voice whispering low in his ear, feel those hands reach right through his armor to caress him once again, to find some new hidden place on his body that would make him go to pieces.
 
He didn’t like this feeling. He never had. His limited tank education had left him in this position many times. His education was deep but narrow, he knew everything about the military history of the Krogan species, but nothing about the social lives of actual, real life Krogan. How many times aboard the Normandy had he needed to swallow his pride or put on a brave face when he obliviously did something absurd or broke some social standard? Was this another one of those times? But it wasn’t quite the same though. It wasn’t just a desire to not be embarrassed this time, but a very real part of him was excited at the idea of what Jax might do with him.
 
“Gah. Fuck it.” He eventually declared, making up his mind. He’d at least go and talk to the old one, that was it. He had to get Jax off his mind one way or another, and there was nothing wrong about hitting the bar with another Krogan. He’d heard plenty of war stories there, this would just be another conversation like that, just on a different subject. He was sure once he knew more he could firmly decide that this wasn’t for him, that he knew what he liked and was quite satisfied. Convince himself that his mind was just forming random connections by imagining vague scenes of his grey body being smothered beneath a larger mass of rutting orange.
 
The bar was a simple thing. Some outside seating, an interior area. A slab of old, discarded Tomka armor for a bar top and mismatched seating spread around. Grunt sat down on one of the stools, tapping the metal of the bar top in a nervous tic. The Krogan behind the bar came over, giving him a look.
 
“The usual?” He asked, looking at Grunt’s tapping finger.
 
“I’m uh… I’m looking for Jax.” He mumbled, not making eye contact.
 
“Ah.” The barman said, and there was a note of understanding in that one syllable. Grunt shifted uncomfortably. Was everyone going to start thinking he was looking for males to take him now? Would anyone even care? His thoughts were interrupted by a now familiar presence at his side as Jax sat down beside him.
 
“Was only half sure you’d show.” Jax said, one elbow on the bar to face Grunt, looking quite pleased to see him. “Two shots of Ryncol.” Jax said to the barman, who poured them their shots. “Here pup, you’re looking fit to explode, tense as you are.”
 
Grunt threw back the shot instantly, slamming the cup back down on the armor plated bar. The familiar burn on the back of his throat seemed to wipe out some of his reservations, the hard drink softening his nerves a bit. He turned towards the older male and opened his mouth, getting ready to tell him this was purely polite conversation, which would have been a first for Grunt in itself. But the words died in his throat, and after coughing once to clear the air he asked, much more truthfully. “So what… ah… were you thinking of doing to me?” He asked, feeling a flush rising in his cheeks. Damn it, he did not blush!
 
Jax didn’t laugh, though he did breath out a sharp huff that might have almost been one. “First of all… it’s not what I’m doing to you, it’s what I’m doing with you.” He corrected. “Mutual. I’d want you to enjoy yourself as much as I do. As for what specifically… well we’ll just have to see how things go. Let you experience the other side of things, maybe even teach you a few things, if you’re paying attention.”
 
Grunt pursed his lips. “What’s there to know? You take your cock and…” He made a shoving gesture.
 
Jax snorted. “I was watching your performance earlier pup… you’ve got a lot of physical prowess but you’re wasting it. You’re sloppy… and not very considerate. There’s a lot more to lovemaking than just pounding at your partner until you both fall over.” Jax gave him a sardonic look. “If you were on the receiving end of such a simple hump… well you’d know how it’s hardly the most satisfying thing a male can give you. But I’m not so careless to only give you something like that.”
 
The concern in Jax’s voice was something Grunt wasn’t used to He wasn’t sure how to deal with it. It just wasn’t something he was used to, this kind of warm concern for his wellbeing and growth. It felt like something Shepard would say, in the unlikely case this topic ever came up. Grunt cleared his throat, shifting a little in his seat. “So you wanted that… now?”
 
Jax held his gaze for a long moment before he nodded slightly. “I’m willing, if you are.”
 
Grunt looked his elder in the eye for a long moment. He didn’t trust himself to speak, but eventually he gave a sharp nod. A strange feeling of relief flowed through him. The decision made, now he only had to ride it out.
 
Jax grinned a little and gave him a firm nod, downing his Ryncol and standing up. “Well then, follow me.” He growled, heading out of the bar.
 
They walked in silence for a good way. Grunt was suddenly unsure of what to do with his hands and kept fidgeting. Whenever he glanced to Jax the elder male held his gaze and gave him a reassuring kind of nod. Soon enough they arrived at a house built into the lee of an ancient support column, seemingly welded together from scrapped armor plates. Jax opened the door for him and Grunt stepped inside. Old banners, flickering screens and old wood furniture were set around, a terminal sitting in one corner, big bed pushed in the back. The house was one large room, but the whole place seemed sturdy enough.
 
“Nice place.” Grunt said, reaching up to start unclasping his armor.
 
“You collect a few nice things when you’ve been alive as long as me.” Jax chuckled, before he gave Grunt’s hand a light slap. “Stop that.”
 
Grunt jumped a little, that tap seeming to carry a lot more force than it should have. “What? I need to get my armor off.”
 
Jax shook his head. “No, pup. I need to get your armor off.” The old Krogan reached up and began unclasping Grunt’s plating, taking his time. “It’s better like this, we do each other.” He explained, seeming unhurried, removing Grunt’s pauldrons and setting them on a nearby table.
 
Grunt nodded. He knew he was out of his element now, but his pride made him want to do this right. Even if he really had no clue what he was doing. He reached over and tried to imitate what he was seeing, unzipping Jax’s jumpsuit, exposing the Krogan’s muscular chest and darkened plating.
 
Grunt’s own chest armor thumped as it was placed on the counter, leaving him in his undersuit from the waist up, Jax unzipping it and slipping it off Grunt’s shoulders to leave him half exposed, the elder shrugging out of his own sleeves to bare his chest. Almost unbidden, Grunt’s hand reached up to trace the scars on the craggy plates, his own plates almost spotless by comparison, a reminder that he had seen few battles compared to this ancient warrior.
 
Jax grinned at his inquisitive touching. “That’s nice.” He breathed. “Try to trace the seams between the plates. Like this.” He said, reaching over to start rubbing over Grunt’s chest. Grunt breathed in sharply at the touch, clever fingers teasing the seams between his armor plates, drawing out a pleasant tingling.
 
“Like this?” He asked, trying to do the same.
 
He knew he wasn’t doing it right, but Jax nodded anyway, letting him feel about for a little while before he gently pushed Grunt’s hands off. “Now, to finish you off.” He said, getting down on his knees before the tank bred.
 
Jax’s clever hands quickly stripped off the remaining armor plating on Grunt’s legs, before unzipping him the rest of the way and tugging Grunt’s jumpsuit down around his ankles, exposing him completely. “Damn pup, that’s one great quad you got.” Jax said with an chuckle, the warm breath across his quad making Grunt suck in breath.
 
Jax looked up at him, one brow raised. “That sensitive huh? Nobody ever paid this quad proper attention before?” Grunt was about to ask what the old male meant when Jax leaned in and breathed heavily onto his quad, making him groan.
 
“N-Nobody’s ever done that before.” He groaned, his pulse skipping a beat as those deep orange eyes looked up from quad height, Jax grinning broadly.
 
“I figured. The real question is… do you like it?” Jax asked with a teasing drawl in his deep voice. Maintaining steady eye contact he leaned in and breathed hotly on Grunt’s quad, so close his lips almost touched the tender sac.
 
Grunt breathed in a shaky breath, his tip sliding out of his sheath, when did the little shack become this warm? “Yeah.” He gulped. “Yeah I like it.”
 
“Good~” Jax rumbled. “Then you’ll love this.” Before grunt could ask what he was about to do Jax opened his mouth, and licked Grunt’s quad from bottom to top, broad tongue sliding wetly over his tender skin.
 
“Gah~” Grunt’s eyes went wide and he sucked in a gasp, he’d never felt anything like this! He’d never suspected his quad could make him feel this good, nor had he even thought of using his mouth or tongue for pleasure, but this was… this was amazing.
 
“This isn’t like anything I’ve done before.” Grunt groaned, looking down at Jax. “Is this fucking?” He asked suddenly, not having ever been told of nor imagine an act like this.
 
Jax let out a little chuckle, looking up to meet Grunt’s eyes again. “It’s called foreplay pup, you should pay attention, learn something.” He licked again, to the side this time, sliding his tongue up previously untouched skin. “Helps your partner get in the mood, makes things better when the main event starts.” He licked up the other side next, trailing his tongue along the edge of Grunt’s quad before he went further up his sheath, flicking his tongue over Grunt’s partly emerged shaft which made it buck and slide out a few more inches.
 
Grunt gulped. “I see what you mean.” He groaned.
 
Jax nodded. “Here, widen your stance a bit.” He said, gnarled old hands gently spreading his thighs. He did as he was bid, and was rewarded with another lick that went from the base of his quad to the tip of his shaft. Grunt realized his wider stance let his quad hang a bit more free, made it easier for Jax to lick over his tender sac. Grunt didn’t know what to do with his hand, they hung loose at his sides, clenching and relaxing.
 
“Here pup.” Jax said, taking hold of grunt’s hands. “Touch me, like this.” Jax guided Grunts hands, one to his neck, one to his crest. “Touch your partner, stroke, pet, squeeze, let them feel your appreciation, a little affection goes a long way.”
 
Grunt nodded, not expecting such tender instruction from a hardened old warrior, but nothing about this encounter had gone as he’d expected. He started stroking and patting Jax’s head and shoulders, letting his hands move of their own accord, and Jax nodded before returning his attentions to Grunt’s quad. Soon his shaft was fully emerged, a bead of pre glistening at the tip.
 
“Mmm… suppose I should show you a little care here now…” Jax rumbled with a chuckle, grinning up at Grunt. He’d never imagined seeing an older warrior like this on his knees, nor finding the sight so intensely erotic. Jax looked utterly at home here, not the slightest trace of discomfort or shame at kneeling down to give another pleasure.
 
Before he could even ask what Jax was planning now, the older male opened his mouth and took most of Grunt’s cock into it in one smooth motion.
 
“Ooohhh~” Grunt moaned, his legs turning partly to jelly.
 
It was so different from fucking, male or female. His length was enclosed in an insanely wet and warm space that kept flexing and twisting. Jax's tongue rubbed along the underside of Grunt's cock, the elder warrior taking the shaft deep into his mouth and suckling on it in long pulls.
 
Grunt felt like he might have fallen over if it weren't for the strong hands gripping his hips. One of Jax's hands reached around, squeezing Grunt's muscular rump and sending tingles of pleasure up his spine. He leaned forward, putting more weight on Jax's shoulders as he panted out his pleasure.
 
Far from looking displeased, the old krogan seemed to enjoy the feeling, bright orange eyes looking up past his ancient crest with molten intensity. A deep thrum of pure erotic energy sounded in Jax's chest and went up to his mouth, making it vibrate around Grunt's cock and increasing the pleasure yet more. The old warrior began to bob his head, letting the shaft slide partway out of his mouth before he slid it back in between squeezing lips.
 
Grunt was just aware of his situation enough to realize the amount of skill that was being displayed in this act, every touch, every twist was perfected to bring the most pleasure possible out of him, and every rumble and look meant to bring him to ever height levels of arousal and excitement.
 
He couldn't last, he knew it in his hump. He was falling apart at the seams again and it felt so fucking good he couldn't stop it. "Gonna. I'm gonna." The words kept dying in his mouth, like he was so fucked up he couldn't even remember how to say it. He heard the barest hint of a chuckle coming from that full mouth before Jax started massaging his quad with a skilled hand.
 
That was it, Grunt was lost. He arched forward, gripping Jax for support as he groaned out his climax. His cock bucked, his quad tightened, and he shot rope after rope of thick seed into the old warrior's mouth. Jax handled the torrent without issue, swallowing the seed down gulp after gulp, before he let Grunt's spent cock slip from his mouth. The old warrior grinned cockily up at him, lips still wet with seed.
 
"So, how'd that feel?" He asked, standing up.
 
Grunt just gave him a slightly vacant smile and chuckled at first. "Heh... wow. That was... heh." He shivered, all worries about how this might play out gone, his reservations banished by one of the best orgasms he could remember. The old krogan had brought him to heights of pleasure he didn't even know existed, and the ancient wasn't even naked, Jax still had his jumpsuit fashioned about the waist.
 
"Pretty fucking good, right?" Jax said, licking his lips clean and grinning at the younger krogan.
 
Grunt nodded enthusiastically. "Yeah! That felt... I don't have the words!"
 
The ancient chuckled in that deep, growling way of his. "Gooood then~ Now that you've tasted a little of what a skilled male can do for another, and you know how good it feels..." He tugged meaningfully on the hem of his half-off jumpsuit. "You won't object to learning how to do it yourself, will you pup?"
 
Grunt gulped, his eyes trailing down Jax's chest to the hem of his jumpsuit, noting the prominent bulge tenting the fabric.
 
He raised his eyes to look Jax in the eye again, holding the elder's gaze for a long moment. He remembered Jax's earlier words, about how Grunt lacked skill in his opinion. How he was leaving his partners unsatisfied with his simpleminded attentions. He wanted to be better than that, wanted to be more skilled, wanted to be able to make another male feel as good as Jax had made him feel just now.
 
Slowly, awkwardly, he got down on his knees in front of the old warrior. Jax grinned and gave him an encouraging nod as Grunt's hand went up towards the hem of Jax's jumpsuit. Having no better idea how to do it, he gripped the zipper and pulled down.
 
The bulge of Jax's erection strained at the fabric, the zipper going down with what felt like aching slowness until at last it gave way and the elder's cock burst free. Maybe it looked bigger right in front of Grunt's face but it was obvious that Jax was very well hung. A krogan's growth slowed as they aged, but never quite stopped, and Jax was very, very old. A slight blush crept over Grunt's face and he glanced down on reflex, he wasn't that much smaller...
 
Jax caught the small movement and a gentle hand rested on Grunt's shoulder, giving him a little squeeze. "Easy pup, you're young and have a lot of growing to do. You've got one hell of a nice quad on you, nothing in the world to be ashamed of. Maybe if you payed a little more attention to your lovers quads before, you'd know how lucky you really are."
 
Grunt flushed at the gentle reminder of his lack of experience, but worked up his courage. "Not lucky." He said with a little smirk. "Pure krogan, you should be in awe."
 
Jax huffed out a laugh. "Well you tasted pretty damn good, that's for sure."
 
Grunt smirked, but eventually his eyes were drawn back to the cock in front of his face. He realized quite suddenly he'd never been up close with another male's quad before and had absolutely no idea what to do.
 
He almost expected a rebuke for waiting so long, but despite being achingly hard Jax seemed quite at ease, giving Grunt another reassuring squeeze. "First time's not easy." He rumbled. "Take it slow, explore. Just use your hand at first, and get used to the scent."
 
Grunt nodded, leaning in a little closer. He breathed in, a thick and strong musk of pure masculinity and he blushed lightly when the scent drew a little groan out of him. He reached up, gingerly touching Jax's warm quad and was rewarded with the old warrior drawing in a short breath.
 
Grunt remembered how Jax had begun and leaned in, breathing out warm air on the tender skin and got another little shudder before he finally worked up his courage for what was coming next. He opened his mouth and leaned in. Time seemed to stretch, taking much longer than it should have before finally, his tongue met the tender skin on Jax's heavy sac.
 
It was... not bad at all really, Grunt decided. Warm, musky, a powerful and pleasant taste he never would have thought he'd like. But he did. He let his eyes close and licked some more, flicking his tongue over one of Jax's heavy balls before he dragged his tongue up the elder's shaft, tasting the droplets of pre that were sliding down. No, not bad at all. Strong, unusual, but it was exciting as well and the taste and smell of it was sending tingles of excitement up his spine.
 
Grunt kept at it, his movements becoming stronger, pressing harder against the soft warm flesh, bobbing his head and groaning lightly as he got used to it. Jax began to touch him back, clever hands running along his crest and back, teasing out sensitive points where the plates of his crest joined and rubbing on his shoulder gently.
 
He got what the elder had been saying, the feeling of affection he was getting from the touches really helped him and soon Grunt decided it was time to take things a little further. He brought his tongue off, opening his mouth and getting ready to take the shaft as Jax had before. He hesitated just the briefest moment, seeing the shaft pointed right at his face, pulsing with the ancient's heartbeat.
 
"It's okay, you can take it slo-" Jax stated to say.
 
Grunt was done though. Done being hesitant, done being coddled. It was nice how the old male was being careful with him, guiding him gently. Grunt appreciated it, but he didn't need it, not now at least. He was strong, and he was brave, and even though he was prepared to be bad at this he sure as hell wasn't going to be gently led by the hand." With no further ado he leaned in, taking Jax's cock almost completely into his mouth.
 
Jax gasped at his boldness, but didn't seem at all upset by his quick movements. The feeling of another male's cock in his mouth was alien, strange, but not unpleasant. He wasn't going to let this throw him off balance, he would show this old warrior that he learned fast. He remembered what Jax had done and did his best to emulate it, suckling on the shaft as he pulled back, then loosening up as he slid back in.
 
He knew it was sloppy, knew it wasn't that good, knew he was occasionally bumping the cock with his teeth when he'd never once felt Jax's teeth on his skin. But damn if he wasn't trying his hardest. Jax certainly didn't seem to mind though. If Grunt's clumsy first attempt was less than pleasant, the ancient male didn't show it.
 
Jax groaned in pleasure, rocking his hips gently to help bring his cock in and out of the younger krogan's mouth, his pleasure groans a bass rumble from his broad chest. "Just... like that. Yeah, just keep doing that." He groaned, scritching at the back of Grunt's neck, right where the plates of his fledgling crest met his skin, another place that seemed to cause tingles of excitement and pleasure to race through him. Idly Grunt wondered how many of those hidden pleasure spots he had on his body, he'd have to ask Jax to show him...
 
He picked up the pace as best he could, but the faster he went he sloppier he got, and when he slowed down to focus he was sure it wasn't as enjoyable. He was sure he was messing this up despite him desperately wanting to make this good for his partner, and when Jax withdrew his shaft from Grunt's mouth he looked up to apologize.
 
Jax pressed a finger to his lips, silencing him. "Shh." The ancient warrior said softly. "I'm ready to move on, enough foreplay. I'm ready to take you... if you're ready to take me."
 
Grunt gulped, but nodded, standing up before the old warrior. He idly noted that his own shaft was back to hardness already, but he had to admit this was probably the most erotically exciting moment of his life. Even mating with the females hadn't been this exciting. That had been wonderful, but in retrospect he realized he was satisfying a need, fulfilling an imperative. Mating and breeding like the tank had taught him. That may have been lust but this? This was passion, something he hadn't realized was missing from his life until this moment.
 
"I'm ready." Grunt said with absolute confidence, looking over to the bed.
 
"I know you are." Jax rumbled with a smile, giving Grunt's rump a pat.
 
Grunt grinned a little nervously and walked over to the bed, clambering up onto it and starting to get on all fours.
 
"No." Jax said firmly.
 
"What?" Grunt asked, looking back over his shoulder.
 
Jax made a circular gesture with his finger. "Roll over. On your back." He instructed firmly.
 
Grunt was a little confused, but did as he instructed. He felt a little vulnerable laying here, Jax towering over him.
 
"Good~" The ancient male rumbled, stepping closer. "I want to be able to look into your eyes when we make love." He said in a bass rumble that reverberated through Grunt's fledgling plates. The younger male groaned in arousal at the idea, squirming on the bed.
 
Jax clearly understood he had no idea what to do with himself and took charge again. "Brace your arms on the bed, prop yourself up or lay down as you like, and get that ass over here." He chuckled, grabbing Grunt's hips and pulling them close to the edge of the bed.
 
Grunt chuckled. "You can't wait for me, huh?" He asked, a bit of his usual cockiness returning as he became more comfortable with what was happening. He still had no idea what to do, and no clue how this would turn out. He accepted that, he would ride this out as best he was able, and see what happened along the way. He'd made his peace with the fact he was in over his head, and falling head over heels.
 
Jax smirked, gripping Grunt's legs and spreading them, holding his thighs up and apart to expose his rear. "Well, don't let this inflate you already impressive ego... but you are one dead sexy bastard. I can't wait to see your plates grow in properly, when you have a proper crest..." The ancient warrior groaned, envisioning the sight of a fully mature Grunt seemed to be quite a pleasant thought.
 
Grunt tapped Jax's sides with his heels, tugging the old male closer with his legs. "Hey! I'm here right now, don't get lost daydreaming old man!" He chuckled.
 
Jax looked down at him, shaking his head. "Mmm, sorry pup. When you're as old as me the mind tends to wander a bit... however can I make it up to you?" He grinned, leaning forward and slowly slipping his shaft between Grunt's thighs.
 
"I'm... ah... sure you'll think of something..." Grunt chuckled nervously, his eyes widening as he felt Jax's shaft pressing at his hole. The cock pressed against him, harder, more insistently. He sucked in a breath, his heartbeat increasing as he felt it probing against his pucker, felt his flesh starting to yield. Then the pressure receded, the cock withdrawing, and he let out an explosive breath. "W-What's wrong?" He asked, feeling both relieved and cheated.
 
"You're still to tense pup." Jax said softly. Seeing the look on Grunt's face the old warrior chuckled and gave his rump a playful slap. "Don't worry pup, it's normal on your first time, but I can make it go easier on ya. Heh, you were eager to take me, weren't ya?"
 
Grunt grumbled noncommittally but Jax could see the truth and chuckled again. "So what are you gonna... oh fuck!" He exclaimed as he watched Jax smoothly spread his rump cheeks and bury his face in Grunt's muscular ass.
 
It was another thing that Grunt had never imagined doing, but it felt so damn good his surprise didn't last more than a second or two. Jax's lips were on his puckered entrance, his tongue lapping over the hole a few times before shoving inside. Grunt's eyes rolled up slightly and he balled his hands into fists, gripping the sheets tightly as he was rimmed. Jax's tongue was nimble and agile, twisting around inside him, exploring him, plunging alarmingly deeply. First it twisted this way, then another, then it stretched him with cyclic licking motions deep within.
 
Grunt panted, his body heaving, his cock already achingly hard felt fit to burst again, but he couldn't let that happen. He may be a tender whelp compared to the craggy ancient but he was not going to cum twice before they'd even had proper sex! And certainly not before he'd made his partner cum even once. This went on for a brief eternity, Jax's wet tongue touching him in places he didn't even know he had, before he panted and spoke up. "Please Jax, no more, I can't take anymore."
 
Jax slowly pulled free, looking up at Grunt with hungry eyes. Nobody had ever looked at him like that, with that kind of smouldering need, and he felt himself twisting into pleasant knots.
 
"Please..." He said, putting a little whine into his voice. He arched his back, letting one leg slid up the bedsheets a little to present himself more fully. "I need you, please."
 
Jax nodded once and swiftly mounted the younger male. Grunt gasped as he felt himself pressed down, he knew this was it, no more waiting, no more foreplay. It was time to get fucked. And he wanted it so damn badly.
 
This time when the cock pressed against his hole there was no hesitation. Jax leaned forward, and Grunt's pucker yielded. His moist hole stretched, and Grunt gasped out loudly as the tip of Jax's cock popped inside him with no further ado. He had no time to think about it though, as powerful hands grabbed his waist and the elder thrust, sliding more cock inside of his well prepped ass.
 
Grunt's eyes closed and he panted loudly, clenching up and then relaxing. As soon as he let himself loosen a little Jax plunged deeper inside of him. He may have been very gentle, but the old warrior was ruthless as well. His thrusts were powerful, insistent, unrelenting, making it very clear that he wasn't going to be satisfied until he'd stretched Grunt out as far as he could go, until he was sheathed within him.
 
Grunt felt himself being filled more and more, and cracked an eye to look back at the male taking him. Jax's face was a mask of pleasure, his eyes either lidded with the pleasure of the act, or closed in effort as he gritted his teeth and thrust, then gasped out in satisfaction on the return thrust.
 
"Like... my ass... huh?" Grunt asked, some of his old cocky tone coming back, though somewhat lessened in effect by his panting moans.
 
"You're so fucking tight." Jax grunted. "So good!"
 
It was that more than anything that made this perfect for Grunt. Knowing that he was pleasing this ancient one, who surely had no shortage of fine ass, that Grunt was giving him this kind of pleasure. To look at the male that had played him so masterfully, had opened him up in mind and body so completely, and see him in this kind of joy was amazing to Grunt.
 
Then Jax's heavy quad slapped against Grunt's inner thighs and he more or less stopped thinking altogether. Jax realized he'd bottomed out and drew back fully for the first time. He pulled back until only the tip was still inside him, then slammed forwards again to fill him completely. Grunt threw his head up and cried out, his eyes popping wide open as he felt that first full thrust. Then another one, and another one, and another one, each one feeling like it might split him open.
 
It was so good, too good! And given by the gasps and moans and constant whispered praises from the male atop him it felt the same for Jax. Grunt wasn't sure when he came, his world was a twisted mess of thrusting and grunting and slapping flesh, he just knew it happened at some point because he remembered feeling the slickness on his belly from his seed painting the sheets.
 
Jax carried on, his thrusts growing faster and more needy, until he slammed deeper than ever before, somehow finding some depths not yet explored, and Grunt felt a hot rush of cum flooding into him. As Jax crowed out his pleasure, Grunt moaned hotly, the thick cream of the ancient warrior pooling inside him, liquid heat. Pump, pump, pump, he could feel the cock pulsing, feel each thick jet of seed filling him out a little more. Pump, pump, so full, he wondered if it would slosh audibly when he walked.
 
Finally it stopped, and all was stillness and panting breath. Then slowly, seeming like he felt every minute of his age, Jax lay down atop Grunt with a shaky groan. "Fuck... that was..." He muttered.
 
"Amazing." Grunt finished. They lay there in near silence for a long moment, Grunt feeling Jax slowly soften up, feeling the cum pooling inside him. "You know we're gonna have to go again." He said softly.
 
Jax chuckled, giving him a light, playful swat. "Mmm... yeah... but be gentle on me. I'm ancient, these old bones ache."
 
Grunt smirked, closing his eyes. "Seem pretty strong to me." He moaned.
 
The ancient let out a huff of a laugh. "I've created a monster... you're insatiable."
 
"Maybe you're just not trying hard enough?" Grunt suggested with a tired grin.
 
"Mmm... might make you regret those words pup... but later. For now, rest." He said, wrapping an arm around Grunt's chest.
 
Grunt nodded, shifting a little on the bed. He'd never slept with anyone like this before, not with anyone at all. It was amazingly comfortable. "Jax?" He asked softly after a few minutes.
 
"Yeah pup?" The ancient asked tiredly.
 
"Thanks."
 
He could practically hear the old one smile. "You're welcome, pup."
