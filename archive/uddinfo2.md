### PART ROLES *wip*

**Gatekeeper (GK)**
A gatekeeper alter is the one that you go to in regards to who manages fronting; managing when and what alter takes front. In general cases, gatekeepers also take on the responsibility of managing memories, restricting memories from certain alters and having others contain certain memories. Gatekeepers also take on the job of the innerworld where they build its formation and who has access to what parts of the innerworld. 

**Internal/Inner Self-Helper (ISH)**
ISH's are very helpful when it comes to communicating with a therapist as they know the in and outs of the system. They have extensive understanding of their system peers and how they work together. Can also be referred to as the manager of the system.

**Persecutor**
It is not uncommon for a persecutor alter to be an introject of an abuser. Persecutors can be referred to as misguided protectors as they engage in harmful behaviors but often with a protective nature behind it.
Persecutors are not bad alters, there is no such thing as every alter in a system serves a purpose to keep the system going whether or not it comes off as destructive.

**Protector**
Protectors are alters that protect the body, system, host, and certain alters or certain groups of alters. They are the defensive side as well as the fight in a fight, flight, freeze, or fawn response. Protectors can be there for emotional, physical, sexual, verbal, or for all defenses.

**Caretaker/Caregiver**

**Littlex**
A non-explicit term for a little or age-slider that holds trauma such as sexual trauma or trauma with adult themes. 

**Nightwatcher**
Nightwatchers are there in the frontlines when alters who front in the morning or afternoon are too worn out or too tired to function during the night. Theyâ€™re also there in case the body wakes up during the night, being able to manage the body during this period of time. Some of their responsibilities might be brushing teeth, and generally just putting the body to bed.

**Optimist (Energist, Mood Booster)**

**Insider**
The type of alter that doesn't front much and is often detached from the outside world. Often holds traumatic memories and can be so separated from everyday life that they lose track of the time that goes by.

**Holder (Trauma Holder, Symptom Holder, Memory Holder, etc.)**
Holders can either be memory holders or symptom holders. Memory holders, also known as trauma holders, are alters that hold memories that are usually traumatic in nature so that other alters do not have to face them. Symptom holders take on primary symptoms of disabilities whether it be psychosis, autism, etc. Memory holders may hold onto and attempt to preserve memories from the body's childhood (can be negative or positive memories).

**Little/Child Alters**
Infants being 1-3, littles, or child alters, range from the ages 4-12 years of age. May or may not be more mentally capable or mature than real children. May age with the body or at specific dates, or may age sporadically when integration, fusion, or trauma processing occurs. In some systems, it varies, littles growing up is viewed as a sense of healing and progression within a system.

**Middle/Teen Alters**
Age range being 13-17, middles are alters who might have acted as more mature than most children to avoid danger and may or may not be stuck in the mentality or function of a stereotypical teenager. May or may not age with the body or by a certain date, fusion, or integration.

**Adult Alters**
Adult alters having the age range of 17-18+, adult alters may have served as an authoritative, parent-like figure when the body was younger in replacement to an external figure that was not present.
