# Rerun Rewrite
Oh my little daisy,
how you made me racy,
we met while you were playing Sonic,
and ever since my heart's grown cosmic.

I remember that awful day,
in the sunny morning of May,
when I came back home,
and saw you alone,
fallen on the floor,
shattered from the core.

Since then I've been heartsick,
cause you made my heart tick,
for you I have two gifts,
that you'll receive quite swift.

First, I'll make you a zone,
Where you won't be alone,
I'll build you a paradise,
that I know will suffice.

Second, I'll make them pay,
it won't be from a bank,
instead, I'll have a day,
they'll wish they got shanked.

I'll dedicate my life to do all of this,
cause you were my wife, the one who gave me bliss,
looking ahead makes me feel all chilly,
but I'll do it, cause I love you Lily.
