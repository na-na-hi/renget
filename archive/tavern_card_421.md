Comment: “Rinea is a non-playable character from Fire Emblem: Shadows of Valentia, she is the fiancé of Lord Berkut's and although devoted and lovely to him, he mistreats her a lot.

In here you find her late at night and you get a chance to try to convince her to leave Berkut and make her love.
You can either be lovely with her and win her heart or you can be a bit “rougher” until you break her into loving you...both are possible.
