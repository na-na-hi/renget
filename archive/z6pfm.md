##### `Milfwolf`
>59
>Werewolves live a fair bit longer than humans.
>You meet a sexy, mature wolf prowling a bar
>You and she instantly hit it off.
>Before you know it, you've been dating for a few months, and your sappy ass thinks she might be "the one".
>She's cheerful, funny with a bottomless bag of corny jokes, easygoing, a relentless flirt, and an amazing cook. She'd make a perfect mother.
>Your relationship start getting deeper and more serious... so serious in fact, that a few weeks after you (gladly) helped your gf through her heat, she sat you down with some alarming news.
>One of the condoms broke. She's three weeks pregnant, and she wants to keep the unborn pup.
>Mama Anonymous didn't raise a quitter, so you went to the jewelry store, returned with a ring, and asked your wifwolf to become your wife wolf the same day
>She was so thrilled, hugging you tight and almost crying as she accepted.
>Your wifwolf fiance confirms your MILF suspicions when she invites some family over, or more specifically, her two sisters, their werewolf mates and a couple of young, bright-eyed pups.
>"Anon," she says, glowing with pride. "I'd like you to meet my children."
>Why her children are living with their aunts and uncles, you aren't sure, but you hold your tongue at least you accidentally put your foot in your mouth.
>"And..." She seems a little embarrassed, scooping the pups up. "I'd also like you to meet my grandchildren."
>...Oh, those aren't her sisters, the adult wifwolves before you are your fiance's daughters.
>"Kids," your fiance addresses the other adults. "Oh goodness, let's get it all out at once. I'm pregnant, and Anon and I are getting married in the spring."
>"Oh my God...." One puts her hand over her muzzle. "Mom, are you serious?"
>The other wifwolf give you a harsh, suspicious glare.
>One of your soon-to-be son-in-laws mouths "nice" to you, and the other gives you a subtle thumbs up.
>Well shit.
