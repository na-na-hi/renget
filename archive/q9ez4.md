#CVT40k Rationale

>Why a space setting?
/vt/ has a long history of shitposting about chuubas in wh40k, stretching back to the /jp/ days. Additionally, many chuubas have backstories or themes set in futuristic settings. This AU provides an outlet for this type of creation.

>Why set in a space sector (like the Koprulu sector in StarCraft) instead of a solar system (like Diebuster) or a whole galaxy (like Warhammer 40k).
This setup seems to strike a nice balance of a variety of factors. A single solar system may put undesired constraints on writers who would like to write about a particularly isolated population, or who would like to write about exploring unknown territories. Opening the setting to the entire galaxy may result in a directionless, disjointed setting, and may make interactions harder for writers who would like to make a more restrained/grounded use of FTL. A space sector of a few hundred stars with populated "Core Systems" and sparsely explored "Fringe Systems" seems to accommodate more approaches.

>Why "no current time" and non-parallel timelines?
This way, the writers can feel comfortable writing for any event at any period they like. Given the pace of the project, keeping a timeline with a consistent time factor rigorously aligned to IRL events is difficult, if not impossible.

>Why in a nebula?
It's a way to tie the sector together on a physical level. It's also a way to focus the setting on a specific sector if chuubanite only exists there due to some process. Also, this way the night skies are gonna look pretty cool.

>Why no true canon for contributor content?
With this system, there is no need for reps and voting. This is similar to the approach used by the SCP project. If different people have a different view on a subject, they can amiably develop their own view of it, and whoever interacts with the subject can freely decide which interpretation to adopt. This removes formality and bureaucracy from the creative process, and should encourage simply enjoying the hobby. All lore is created equal.

>Why continuity from original Vitubia instead of a clean slate?
If the writer wants, this way they can tie their lore into this far past history in some way. If not, 40k years is enough time to have an entirely novel society come together. Seems like a win-win.
