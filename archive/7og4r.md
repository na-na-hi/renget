During the summer of 2023, Koyori took her first extended break from streaming since debut. It wasn’t as easy as shutting down her computer and watching the waves roll by on a beach in Osaka, however. In her words, she “didn’t feel productive enough” during the time away from her job, so she ended up hunkering down in the lab alongside the many skeletons of unfinished projects. When she returned from the sterile depths of her worksite seven days later, she held within her gloved hands an effectual, fast-acting shrinking potion.

The experiment itself was on a whim but Lui had found a use for it almost immediately. By shrinking down fellow HoloX member Iroha, Lui had buried the tiny samurai between her massive hawk buttcheeks and put her to work as a personal ass cleaner and fart muffler during her streams and live performances. Lui insisted (with concerning indifference) that she had finally found relief from the constant itchiness in her crack borne of those insanely tight leather hotpants. All it took was having someone down there fulltime to clean out her sweaty asshole.

Koyori and the staff were initially perturbed by Lui’s sadism, but soon came around to the practical uses such a product would have within their company. Hygiene was hard to come by in their talent pool for whatever reason, so this could be an effective way of keeping them both presentable and productive.

The use of shrunken members was formalized later that same week under the designation of “Comfort Assistant''. These are the stories concerning the first month of deploying Koyori’s mad science in the field.

Bae walked into her living room and froze in her tracks.

Lounging atop the room’s center table was a miniaturized Kureiji Ollie. The tattered outfit and patchwork skin were unmistakable, though it was a shock to see all of those familiar features shrunk down to something no taller than a field mouse. 

Bae inched closer. At Ollie’s feet was a note in thick blue ink reading: [She’s in your care! Call us if you have questions– A-chan]

Upon noticing her giant observer, Ollie leapt to her feet and waved both arms frantically over her head like she was flagging down a car off the highway. “*Hi, Bae!*” she shouted, forcing her exuberance into the air. Even in this shrunken state her high-pitched exclamations grated the ears. “A-chan dropped me off earlier! The ride over sucked but it was worth it to see your gorgeous face again! Aren’t I even *cuter* at this size? It’s okay to admit it!”

*Oh boy. So this is really happening, huh?* Bae sighed and scratched behind her ear. She bent over and tried to address the tiny girl without blowing out her eardrums.

“Good to see you, too. Look, one more time, you’re *sure* that you wanna do this?”

Ollie nodded her head so viciously that her hair buns began to unravel. “I’m all yours, Bae! Think of me as a pet! No, less than that! I’m just a tool at your disposal! Whatever you need me for I’ll be there! Use me to trim your fingernails! Or wash your back! Or if you get lonely at night and you need something to fill your-”

“Alright! Thank you, I get it.” Bae snagged the note from the table and folded it into her pocket. If Ollie was this transparently eager then there wasn’t much reason to hesitate. Apparently she was one of the few who actively *volunteered* for this position. Most of the other girls were less than eager to spend dozens of hours as their friends' personal sweat rag.

Ollie leered at Bae’s body with mounting anticipation. Her mind was already racing at the day’s possibilities. “What should we do first, Bae? Your feet must be tired from walking all day, I can give them a massage! Or if you prefer I can knead out the tension in your chest! I’ll be careful around the sensitive areas!”

While she yammered on, Bae casually snatched her up like a can of soda. Ollie’s head was thrown back harshly and she felt the wind whistle past her ears as Bae hoisted her into the air. “Whoa! So forward, I love it when a girl takes the lead!”

Bae brought Ollie around behind her waist. Using her free hand, Bae dipped under her miniskirt and fished around for the thong that was buried somewhere between her thick cheeks. She pulled it outwards, forming a taunt “<” shape.

“So, uh, as we discussed…my butt’s been having a lot of trouble with sweating recently.” Bae sheepishly lowered her voice as she went on. “I don’t know what changed. Maybe the weather or something? Anyway, I cahn’t go recording or shopping around town with this feeling itching at my bum, so…just keep it clean, alright?”

Ollie almost burst into tears of joy. “Oh my God! Already?! I’m so happy you’re feeling this comfortable around me! I’ll do my best for you back there! My lips are already warmed up and ready to go!”

Already exhausted of her flirtatiousness, Bae blindly shoved the prattling zombie *deep* into her sweaty butt crack like a scrunched up piece of toilet paper, then used two fingers to mash her down even further. She didn’t stop until she could feel her senpai’s entire body wedged snugly between her cheeks. Relaxing her finger, Bae then released her thong and let it snap back into place, smacking painfully over Ollie’s back and sealing her tightly against Bae’s slick butthole and taint. Ollie's exasperations were pleasantly muffled.

“Right then. You okay?” Bae lifted her miniskirt and twirled around in front of the full length mirror resting on the wall by the TV cabinet. The glass captured a nice turnaround of her supple buttocks and thighs, but there was no sign of Ollie. *Oh naur, did she fall out?* 

“Ohhh…nevermind…” Bae hefted up her right cheek. Bingo. Right where the color of her butt transitioned from a pale white to the rosy pink of her asshole, you could see the miniscule gray-blue limbs of Ollie poking out from behind a narrow black string. And based on the location of those small tufts of brilliant red hair, Ollie’s face was smashed firmly against Bae’s pucker. 

Relieved, Bae released her butt cheek and let it slap back over Ollie’s twitching body. 

Meanwhile, Ollie’s horny brain was working itself into a rabid frenzy. Getting to eat out this chaotic idol’s asshole was a fantasy she’d held since watching the debut stream all those Augusts ago, and it was made all the more gratifying now that she was shrunk down to a size where she could literally suffocate herself in it. Hungrily, Ollie opened her mouth and ran her salivating tongue over Bae’s juicy backdoor. Her tongue passed over each anal wrinkle with great reverence, sometimes lingering for full minutes at a time to properly savor the flavor profile, then eagerly swept along to the next sweat-filled crevice. She would have liked to touch herself as well, but her arms were solidly pinned by the tension from Bae’s underwear, so she had to settle for groping what she could of Bae’s cheeks.

Ollie’s only complaint was the stinging soreness still radiating off her back from where Bae’s thong had slapped her like a bed-sized paddle. The heat and pressure were steadily climbing as well, bringing a constant uncomfortable stickiness to her skin while she vigorously rubbed her face across Bae’s hole. Moderate discomforts aside, she was in total bliss and fully committed to her assignment.

And Bae could tell. Even with their gulf in size, Bae could pick up the small licks and slurps from Ollie’s cool undead tongue adoring the edges of her sensitive rim, and the raw pleasure sent up her spine briefly wobbled her footing. Ollie’s anal worship was giving Bae’s extensive lineup of sex toys a run for their money.

With her butt toy properly buzzing along, Bae checked her phone and reviewed her tasks for the day. Special corporate guests were coming over later in the week and the place had to look at least two tiers up from “presentable”. Bae dragged out the mop, vacuum, and an assortment of rags from the hall closet and prepared herself for a full day's worth of cleaning.

===

The one bedroom apartment was deceptively dense with furniture and surfaces to polish. Bae’s shapely thighs rubbed together as she bent, stretched, and shimmied from one corner of the room to the next. Sometimes the top of a cabinet or shelf was too high up for her compact figure, and she had to jump in place to guide her duster along the top. She could faintly hear her cheeks clap together on each bounce.

Any manner of cardio took a long time to affect someone as active as Bae, but her clothes eventually grew damp with sweat all the same. She fanned her face and found herself airing out her skirt more frequently as the day dragged on and the temperature climbed.

Ollie, for her part, took a while to notice how much worse the air circulating around her had gotten. The pleasant feminine musk that marked her arrival was thoroughly drowned out by the sharp scent of body odor and, without a more elegant descriptor on hand, the nose-wrinkling stench of sweaty, unwashed ass. For the first time, Ollie’s deep purple tongue hesitated before dragging across the sticky surface of Bae’s rim. The flavor collecting on her taste buds was far more salty and bitter than before, and she seriously struggled to push it down her throat. Her smile remained resolute, and she somehow fought the urge to retch as she continued guzzling Bae’s ass sweat.

Still, progress was slowing down considering how much more liquid she needed to swallow. Ollie’s body grew lethargic as the heat sapped her strength and her stomach approached its capacity.

It was only a matter of time before Bae noticed the slack.

===

Bae frowned as she busied herself with the penultimate chore. The stubborn grout in the countertop tiles were seriously pissing her off, and now there was something else bothering her: a familiar itchiness forming in the deepest recesses of her butt crack.

She set down the cleaning rag, annoyed. The whole point of inserting Ollie between her cheeks was to keep her clean down there, and she was already dozing off? Bae put her hands on her hips and stared at her skirt. Ollie needed a wake-up call. “Oi! Wake up, bro! You cahn’t just nod off after a few hours.”

When she didn't notice a response, Bae simply sighed and clenched her thick, powerful glutes– glutes molded by years of dancing, squats, and wall climbing.

Two huge walls of sweaty ass flesh slammed together, completely indifferent to the tiny body that was stuck between them. Ollie barely got out a gasp of surprise before she was flattened between Bae’s cheeks like a paper doll. She was sure she blacked out. When it happened a second time she made sure to dive her disorientated face into the center of Bae’s slick rim and lap feverishly at the spots where the worst of her tangy ass sweat was building up. She barely left herself the space to breathe with how deep she was cleaning.

Bae’s soft rat ears twitched happily upon hearing (and feeling) Ollie’s vigorous slurping resume. Looks like she got the message.

The countertop took only a few more minutes to finish. Bae wiped her brow and decided she deserved a break. She grabbed a carton of strawberry milk from the back of the fridge– the sixth one of the day– and noted with quiet resignation that her garbage can was overflowing with a mountain of empty pink boxes from yesterday's binge. She would need to take that out to the dumpster as well before the day was done.

As Bae gingerly peeled off the plastic wrapping securing the straw to the carton’s side, her stomach threw itself into a impudent roiling gurgle. Bae paused, then shook her head and stubbornly punctured the straw through the drinking hole.

Her lactose intolerance had been flaring up a lot these days thanks to her new favorite beverage. It used to just be a cheeky midnight snack before bed, but now she found herself throwing one back at all hours of the day. The price of this sweet treat was a near constant bloat bubbling through her digestive tract, leaving her with the worst gas she’d ever had to deal with. The immutable reek of her bedsheets and streaming chair were a testament to this idol’s capabilities, but at least now, with the help of Koyori’s shrinking potion, she had some way to mitigate the damage to her surroundings.

Hopefully.

Bae sucked the carton dry in seconds, finishing with a firm squeeze to empty it out completely. Immediately, her stomach twisted up ferociously and another painful bout of gas rumbled inside.

“Ugh…” Bae doubled over and rubbed her tummy. Her tail twitched anxiously behind her. This one was going to be bad– thank God the guests weren’t here yet and she’d have time to air out the room.

Ollie stopped mid-lick as ominous gurgles roared around her ears. and stared blankly into the hole she was servicing. Her heartbeat quickened, though out of fear or excitement she couldn’t say.

Still massaging her stomach, Bae moved on to the final task– a wispy collection of dust and debris beneath the oven. She dropped to a squat, resting her toned meaty ass on her heels and leaving her backside almost entirely exposed except for a pathetic bit of skirt covering the top of her cheeks.

Hunched over, her thong was drawn *incredibly* tight and forced Ollie even harder against Bae’s asshole, cementing her in place like a sticker. The awful gurgling increased in volume and resounded throughout the smaller girl’s body. Bae nervously shifted side to side and essentially flossed Ollie into her asshole, giving her a firsthand look into what the back of her thongs had to suffer through every day. Ollie dutifully kept her mouth open and tongue spinning, though there was a heavy flush of anxiety creeping inside her chest now. Something about the air tasted different.

As the pressure built, Bae considered undressing and pulling Ollie free. What was brewing in her guts would be borderline unbearable for a normal-sized human from across the room, nevermind someone shrunken down and pressed facefirst against her asshole.

Then again…did Ollie truly deserve that kind of respect?

Ollie had been blowing up Bae’s DMs with unapologetically perverted requests since joining Hololive. Asking to smell her feet or lick her armpits or buy her worn underwear– really shameless stuff when you thought about it. It was simple enough to brush it aside as a quirky on-stream obsession used to farm clips, but even after meeting up in real life, Ollie’s brazen disregard of personal space and social norms continued. Every cute girl within a ten foot radius basically had to beat her off with a stick. Earlier that week, when Bae tactfully alluded to how much damage the spicy noodles had done to her toilet, she had spotted Ollie’s handle flying through the chat window reading  “I WISH I COULD HAVE BEEN THERE!!”.

Yes, Ollie made it very clear over multiple occasions how badly she wanted to drown herself in the scents of her beautiful coworkers. *Every* scent. And until now, no one had the mind to call her bluffs. Bae grinned menacingly and tensed her rumbling stomach. If this horny zombie brat wanted to “Wangy, wangy!” so badly, she’d give her enough stench to stain her nostrils for weeks.

“Hey, Ollie!” Bae called with an unusual streak of cruelty in her voice. “Make sure you keep your mouth open the whole time, ‘kay?”

Ollie, now fully trembling in fear, quietly complied and held her jaw open. She thought herself mentally prepared, but the reality that followed was so much worse.

A shockingly wet, bassy fart thundered out from Bae’s ass, blowing straight past Ollie’s face and the flimsy thong, and rippled the stacked rat’s plump cheeks like pudding on the way out.  Despite the reeking galeforce winds breaking against Ollie’s face, the tightly-wound thong held the back of her skull in an iron grip and kept her firmly, *cruelly* planted in Bae’s sweaty asshole as it spluttered out the enormity of noxious fumes built up inside. The foul gust smacked against the inner pleats of Bae’s tri-colored skirt, wavering them faintly, then spread out to blanket the area around the rat’s ankle in pure vaporous stink.

The blast lasted only a few seconds, but the rancid, nauseating stench of expired dairy and curdled cheese singed Ollie’s poor nostrils into temporary numbness and fumigated the full length of her tiny throat five times over. Ollie’s deviant brain remained immensely turned on, but she still felt hot tears running down her face as her body physically suffered from the disgusting smell raping her sinuses.

“*Mmmhh…*” Bae groaned and let her forehead rest on the cabinet in front of her. A few beads of sweat fell off her chin. 

Bae grit her teeth and pushed out another bubbly, warbling fart that broke the silence of the lazy summer afternoon and shook her ass cheeks. It felt so good to finally relieve some of the pressure that had been punishing her gut since that morning– doubly so knowing it was being crammed down Ollie’s gullet. It ended with a lengthy hiss of an SBD that heated up the back of her thong. 

And that one was *vile*. Ollie gagged and temporarily found it impossible to refill her lungs given all the choking farts clogging her esophagus. Three rasping coughs got her breathing back to normal, allowing her to snort up the huge payload of lingering gas settling in the air around her body. It almost hurt to swallow and the stench was frying her brain cells like cooking oil splashed on a red hot stovetop. 

Bae’s nose delicately sniffed the air to assess the damage. Her eyes went wide and she retched into her hand. “Blegh! Bruh, that is *disGUSTing*!” She shifted on her heels and flapped the back of her skirt to fan the fumes away. Based on that sniff test, Bae figured Ollie’s body managed to filter maybe half of the usual stench. Not a terrible effort, but smelling any trace of her gas was enough to turn anyone’s stomach.

Displeased with her fart sponge’s display, Bae hit upon a spark of inspiration. Her nimble tail curled downwards and maneuvered through her cheeks until it found the back of Ollie’s head. Pressing down with her tail, Bae could feel the zombie’s tiny, quivering form still desperately trying to take in oxygen.

Bae exhaled and let another one rip. Angry bubbles of gas sloshed through her lower digestive tract and blared past her puckering asshole in one impressively long stream. Humid slipstreams of cheesy gas flew over Ollie’s battered face and whipped her hair into a tangle of damp red locks while the sweat from Bae’s buttcrack slathered over her features like a spa day facial. Bae could feel Ollie’s skull vibrating madly as it struggled to muffle her farts. When the pressure got too severe, small jets of gas leaked out around Ollie’s face and brushed warmly across the tip of Bae’s tail.

Ollie’s will was running up against a wall. She had to admit, no matter how highly she regarded Bae or how degenerate her tastes, this was way too much. The noxious smell started to white out her vision. She tried to turn away but Bae’s tail kept her right in the line of fire, forced to breathe deep of every rancid molecule Bae was putting out.

The room fell once more into silence. After using her tail to triumphantly mash Ollie’s face into her wet, fart-drenched asshole, Bae sniffed the air again and found it…slightly better than last time. Maybe it was too much to ask for one mouse-sized Holo to swallow every speck of her legendarily awful dairy farts.

She stood up, grabbed a can of floral air freshener from the counter, and swept it over the area. It didn’t help much. If anything, it added a ghostly hint of violets to the overbearing stench of ass smog blanketing the room. The flooring would likely retain her scent until another diligent pass with the mop and bucket.

Either way, the chores were done and Bae was ready to retire for the night. It was only seven in the evening but the anxiety of upcoming events had thrown her sleeping schedule into utter disarray.

She flicked off the living room lights and trudged into her bedroom. She quickly stripped off her sweaty, clingy clothes (except for her thong and its prisoner, of course), then shimmied her fat butt into a pair of pastel pink pajamas. She hadn’t unpacked them for ages and they’d been crushed by weeks worth of other old laundry, so they carried a stale musk in their fibers.

Bae dropped her butt on the bed, noting the small body stuck wailing and wriggling between her cheeks, then laid down on her back with the covers pulled up to her chin. It was only then that Bae remembered she hadn’t taken a shower yet, and her thick sweaty buttocks and thighs would be sticking to the covers while she slept…but she also had zero desire to leave her bed. Not after getting so comfy.

The room was pleasantly dark with the shades drawn. The soft hum of her fan slowly weighed down her eyelids.

But before she could completely doze off, Bae impulsively turned over and grabbed her phone from the bedside table. She tweeted out a last minute notice for an immediate guerilla space. The number one V-spacer struck again.

Hundreds of people were listening within the first two minutes of going live. The usual greetings poured in, followed by questions asking what she’d been up to and how she'd been feeling.

“Hiii everybody~.” Bae purred into her phone’s lackluster microphone. Her lethargic “just-woke-up” / ”just-going-to-bed” voice was in full effect. Each sentence took twice as long to leave her mouth and occasionally crumbled into a dreary yawn.

“I’m good. Yeah, you know, it’s just been really tiring. The flight took so long and then I had to unpack everything.” Bae rocked her body and slowly crushed Ollie into the mattress. “Oh, and already I met up with some friends while I was here. So that’s nice. They’ve been helping me, uh, clean around the house.”

[Are you still sick?] someone asked from the chat.

“What? No! No, I never get sick. I was just…” Bae paused as a sudden airy fart vibrated her clenched cheeks. A warm spot bloomed from under her ass and tickled the bottom of her sweaty thighs, forcing a pitiful, defeated cry from Ollie. “*Mmmff*…I just had a little stomach ache from food I shouldn’t have been eating. ’S no big deal.”

Chat immediately dogpiled on that comment and teased her a dozen different ways about her strawberry milk obsession and the inevitable stomach pains.

“Shut up! I’m not lactose intolerant, just lactose *sensitive*. There’s a difference!. Hahh, whatever. We’re not talking about that. I wanted to talk about my trip~! Okay, so, the first thing that happened was…”

Bae managed to keep their attention for another hour. She weaved between travel stories, scary dreams, and plans for future songs. All the while, a dangerous bloat of gas built up and she became increasingly paranoid about whether or not she could safely let it out on a hot mic. She wisely decided it wasn’t worth the risk.

“Alright, I should probably go now, but thanks for hanging out! Buh bye everyone. See you on Wednesday after I finish recording! I think you guys are really gonna like this one!”

Bae yawned and dropped her phone to the ground. Finally. She snuggled into her pillow and let a massive, muffled fart ripple through the bedsheets and visibly flutter the edges of her covers. She was surprised (and a little disgusted) at how loud that sounded from under so many layers of blankets. The listeners would definitely have picked up on that.

*Gross. That was bad enough to be one of Calli’s… I hope Ollie saved room for that one.* The muggy warmth traveled all the way down Bae’s legs and reached the bottom of her bare soles as her gas searched for an exit. Ollie jumped to life within Bae’s cheeks as the rancid smell washed over her tiny body and started thrashing like a beached trout.

Thankfully the smell was fully locked down under Bae’s sheets where it would marinate until Ollie eventually took care of it. Bae could feel more farts queuing up to slip out during the night. She had a bad feeling that she’d wake up with a huge damp stain under her ass tomorrow and would need to launder her bedsheets.

But that was a problem for another day.

Ame stared intensely at the pair of black panties outstretched between her hands. The employee at the lingerie section had been confident they would fit someone of her measurements, plus they held a good amount of stretch to them as insurance. Now, back in her bedroom, Ame had to put those claims to the test. She stepped through the leg holes and slowly slid them up her thighs.

No good.

As usual, their journey was interrupted by Ame’s enormously fat ass cheeks, and the waistband dug stubbornly into the middle of her butt. No matter how much she pulled or hopped or flexed, there was simply not enough clearance and the pianoing snaps of ripping elastic told Ame everything she needed to know about the fate of her latest purchase. Dejected, she lowered the torn garment to her heels and kicked them spitefully to the foot of her dresser where it joined a dozen other panties that had been sacrificed to her bottom half.

“Whoa there! I didn’t know it was a full moon tonight,” Gura said from the bedroom doorway, snickering into her sleeve.

Ame felt her ears grow hot and quickly turned about, covering her rear. “Hey, what the heck! This is my room, get outta here!”

“I was just moseying over to the bathroom and your door was wide open. Not my fault that dumpy caught my attention.”

“Look, I’m super busy today, so don’t go dropping in whenever you feel like it.” Ame patted down her skirt and looked sternly in Gura’s direction.

“Yes ma’am. Sorry, ma’am. I’m sure your day is gonna be *plenty* busy trying to wrangle that caboose.”

“Gura…” Ame started aggressively walking towards the meddlesome creature blocking her doorway and finally Gura got the hint to relent.

“Gotta go, bye! Good luck fitting your hips through the doorway, Fatson,” she called, skipping merrily down the hallway.

Ame slammed the door hard enough to rattle the doorknob.

===

Two hours later, there was a knock on the door. From the guest’s timid nature, Ame could tell it was someone other than Gura. Someone she actually wanted to see right now.

“Come in, it’s unlocked!”

Ina gently pushed open the door and tugged her duffel bag inside. The studio space had gotten quite the upgrade since last time she visited and she took a moment to breathe it in– certain angles could pass for a professional set up. That being said, other elements reminded Ina that this was a personal project taking place inside someone’s bedroom, such as the bras draped over the back of Ame’s chair and the puddle of black spats left discarded in the middle of the room. 

Ina started unzipping her bag. “I brought the cables and batteries you texted about. Where do you want these?”

“On the table by the cameras,” Ame said while reaching behind her desk. “Shoot. I need to get something from upstairs. I’ll be right back!”

Ina watched Ame speed past her and barrel up the stairs. The unease of the deadline both of them were working against tightened her chest. She had been brought in as an extra pair of hands, but that still might not be enough to pull this off in time. Ina took a seat within a cluster of laptops and monitors, typing up a storm and flitting her eyes between five different screens.

“What’cha doin’?” came a small voice to her right.

Ina looked up to see Gura swaying in the doorway. It was nice to see her friend, but she had little patience for interruptions at the moment.

“Hey, Gura. Ame has a big tech demo today and we’ve already pushed it back twice, so we’re kinda in a time crunch.” Ina scribbled something down in a notebook, then went back to clacking away at the keyboard. 

“Ooo, that’s why she was so feisty this morning…” Gura strode lazily into the room. In her hand was a curious clear thermos of fluorescent pink liquid. She took a quick swig from it while touring the space. “Cool tech. Looks like you could fly a dang space shuttle from here!”

Ina perked up upon seeing the drink reach Gura’s lips. “Uh, Gura, where did you find that?”

“Fridge. Behind the orange juice. Watson put a big ol’ DO NOT DRINK label on it but she does that for all the good stuff,” Gura said with a wry smile.

“I…really don’t think you should mess with that…”

“Aw, c’mon, what’s she gonna-”

Gura’s voice abruptly vanished like the volume to her vocal chords was flicked off. She seemed to disappear.

Ina peeked over her laptop. “...Hello? Gura? I don’t have time to mess around like this today.”

Then she saw it. A flicker of movement in the middle of the room. Ina narrowed her eyes and saw a small tuft of white hair fidgeting somewhere within the pile of Ame’s spats.

Gura!

It was then that Ina remembered how Ame had signed up as a client for Koyori’s strange program, but management had been unable to find anyone “durable” enough to serve as her Comfort Assistant. Ame must have gotten impatient and found a way to sneak away some of Koyori’s potion. And now Gura stumbled into her stash…

*It’s fine. Nothing’s gonna happen, it’s only me and Ame in the house anyway,* Ina thought as she turned her attention back to the screens. There’d be time to get Gura to higher ground after she finished verifying a few more things. Besides, a little time spent shrunken on the floor might scare Gura into not messing around so much.

Gura opened her eyes to a huge canopy of cables and metal beams criss-crossed over a beige sky. They looked to be hundreds of feet above her. Surrounding her newly minimized body was a room-sized carpet of sleek black fabric. It was damp to the touch and the specific spot she was sitting in felt downright water-logged. An offensive smell wafted upwards and jabbed at her nostrils.

It didn’t take Gura long to understand the gist of her predicament; whatever Ame had in that thermos (a new Watson concoction perhaps?) had shrunk her somehow. Her instincts warned her to get far away from open ground, and she quickly scanned for a desk or cabinet to dive under.

The ground shook violently before she could get to her feet. Terrified, Gura looked up to the doorway taller than a skyscraper and saw Hololive’s number one detective stumble through with a bulky high-end PC tucked under her arm. The slight redness of her face suggested she’d not had the easiest of times bringing it down.

“Okay!” Ame hoisted her PC and shelved it next to a nest of cables. After a quick finagling of wires– plugging, unplugging, and cursing under her breath –the PC booted up with a harsh whine of the spinning cooling fans.

Ame stretched her arms and uttered something between a sigh and a scream. “God, finally! Stupid piece of *shit!*.” She held herself back from smacking the PC case.

Ame gathered herself and nodded at Ina. “Sorry I took so long. Can you monitor the volume levels for the beginning of the stream? The 3D setting sometimes blows out the mic.”

“Uh, yeah, sure. Actually, Ame-”

“Thanks! Lemme pull these on and we can get started…” Ame strode towards Gura’s crash site in four intimidating steps. Each footfall shook Gura’s body off the ground.

The one thing capable of containing Ame’s mass was the well worn, painfully stretched out pair of spats that had just cushioned Gura’s fall. They’d been through the wringer for sure, but the material was tough enough to handle all the extra inches of ass fat Ame had been packing on (if only barely).

Panic surged through Gura's body. She could see where this was going. She knew her voice wouldn’t reach Ame at this size, so she activated her legs and sprinted to the side. Tragically, her foot caught on one of the seams and threw her down on her back. A shadow fell over her dazed, unmoving body.

Ame stepped over the pile of damp spats, nudged one foot through each of the holes and started pulling them up. The seat of Ame's spats sagged into a small hammock under Gura's miniscule weight as she was rocketed skyward. Above and growing larger by the second, she saw two massive globes of ass flesh jiggling within an undersized plaid skirt. The view gave her a new appreciation for all the times she’d teased about Ame being “cheeked up.”

The air grew thick with a myriad of odors emanating from the depths of Ame’s musky ass crack. Gura wanted to cover her face or at least hold her nose, but her limbs were glued to her sides from the substantial gravitational forces acting on her body.

“*Tch*, here comes the hard part,” Ame complained as the extremely stretched waistband of her spats slid over her thick thighs and squeaked to a halt at the bottom of her bubbly ass cheeks. “I hope this pair can make it through the stream….”

Gura was petrified, mere centimeters from the sweaty, disgusting crevice that formed between Ame’s enormous cheeks that dwarfed her body several times over. Fortunately, the spats had stopped moving and she had a window to act! It was now or never. Gura got up on one elbow and psyched herself up to barrel roll over the side.

With a small grunt, Ame snuffed out Gura's escape attempt by yanking her spats all the way up. Well, most of the way up. One third of Ame’s fat cheeks were still on display and hung over the taut waistband, adamantly refusing to make way. Ame huffed in annoyance as she tried to pack the rest of her generous ass meat inside. “What the heck-uh? These fit just fine last week!” She bounced from one foot to the other, and shook her wide hips while pulling upwards, jiggling her bubble butt and putting on an unintentionally erotic display for Ina who had the decency to turn her head away.

Every desperate jerk from the aggravated blonde threw Gura's body into turmoil, drawing closer and closer to the source of the noxious, muggy atmosphere within Ame’s crack. Every time Gura thought it couldn’t get any worse, she was pulled another centimeter deeper. There was almost no light now and the smell was thickening into a heavy odorous sauna that she could taste on her tongue.

“Whew! Finally!” Ame’s spats were on. Or as “on” as they’d ever be. The material was stretched so thin around her cheeks that it had grown slightly transparent in some places, and there was a serious indentation in her plump thighs where the spats bit into her. Coloring on her buttocks with marker would have provided more modesty at this point. 

Ame let her skirt drape back down (not that it covered much of her stupidly fat butt anyway) and did a few test swings with her legs to make sure she could still move comfortably about. Again, Ina had to turn her eyes away to not get a full frontal of Ame’s practically naked ass and crotch.

It was a tight fit, but it would work. Ame turned on the treadmill. The plan for that day was another 3D walking stream which she found quite relaxing once you got past the technical nightmare of setting it up.

“Test! Test! Can you guys hear me~?”

Chat responded positively and Ina corroborated the audio on her end, trying not to think about the unenviable position Gura had been tossed into. She gave Ame a thumbs up from the desk and the stream was confidently given the green light after thirty minutes of delay.

“Thanks for waiting everyone! I know we had a lot of trouble getting things set up but it wasn’t my fault!” Ame pouted as the loathsome memories of her morning came back. “The stupid frickin’ tracking didn’t *work* even though I tested it this morning and did all the driver updates! You guys believe me, right~?”

The treadmill rolled lazily along underneath Ame’s feet. Her unhurried gait rolled her massive ass cheeks against one another and ground poor Gura into mush between them, prompting tiny squeaks and groans from the unlucky shark girl.

Ina looked blankly at the screens in front of her, conflicted. She missed her window to intervene while Ame was squeezing into her spats and now the stream had started proper! Even if she could get Ame to believe her and extract Gura from her cheeks, did she really want to be responsible for another delay?

While Ina debated, Ame gradually turned up the treadmill’s speed. The time slot was rather long today, so she planned to get some actual cardio in.

“Hey chat, does my walk look weird yet?” Ame asked. “Sometimes my legs go *crazy* when I walk too fast cuz the tracking gets confused.” While reading the responses, Ame blushed after realizing she could *feel* the weight of her butt bouncing behind her as she jogged along. She really needed to diet at some point…

The good news was that, based on the chat’s reactions, the new and improved 3D tech held up even when jogging. The bad news was that all the exercise was catching up with her. Ame could feel the first itchy layers of sweat forming on her skin and collecting under her pits. Of course, she knew from experience that the worst of it was happening beneath her skirt and that the seat of her spats would be absolutely *soaked* by the time she wound down and said her goodbyes. That was just a side effect of dragging around that dumptruck of an ass; sweat would collect and marinate into a truly awful funk in that humid crevice over the hours, and nothing but a long shower and a full minute of deep scrubbing could clean it out. She'd made her peace with that fact after ruining her fair share of panties during the first year of streaming. Not that she’d admit it to her friends, but there was a reason she stopped wearing white underwear.

Gura whimpered as streams of sweat funneled down Ame’s ass crack and poured over her face. Even without swallowing, she could taste the intense salty flavor assaulting her lips. It quickly matted down her hair and soaked through her hoodie, leaving her dismally wet and smelling strongly of body odor from head to toe.

“Give me second guys, I gotta check something.” Ame covered her headset mic with her hands and motioned to Ina. 

“Hey, is the input volume on the microphone still set to the lowest value?”

Ina nodded. “Same settings as last time. Why? Are the neighbors planning on doing some construction again?”

“Something like that…” Ame smiled mischievously and uncovered her mic. “Okay everyone, we’re good. You might hear some weird background noises but that’s just me bumping into stuff. The studio space isn’t that big but I’m planning to make the capture zone bigger next time.”

The actual motivation for Ame’s microphone question was the long standing stalemate between her previous meals and her stomach. Two days prior, she’d broken down and partook in a heavily pasta-focused dinner following Gura’s firm insistence. The effects were obvious even on the way out of the restaurant and now Ame had been paying for it for days straight. No matter how many times she plopped her fat butt down on the toilet seat and strained with her skirt around her ankles, she’d never manage to let out anything more than a series of bowl-echoing farts. Constipation was bad enough, but it had the unfortunate side effect of augmenting the smell of her already deadly gas into a veritable bioweapon for the senses.

And Ame knew beyond a doubt that she wouldn’t be able to make it through this stream without letting off some steam.

Thus, after forty minutes of unabated leisurely walking, a quick pang of discomfort gripped Ame’s insides. It felt like a rubber boulder was sitting in her stomach. Grimacing, Ame stepped to one side of the treadmill and stuck her hips out. *Yep, there it was,* she thought. If anything she was surprised it hadn’t happened sooner.

After a few moments of standing still, a tremendously loud, blubbering fart slapped out from between Ame’s ass cheeks and blew out the back of her skirt. The pitch started low and sunk even deeper as Ame closed her eyes and leaned forward a bit. The uncomfortable pressure in her gut lightened up somewhat as the raunchy four-second blast continued rippling from under her skirt and rapidly doused the area around the treadmill in her fetid aroma. It petered off in a bubbly squeak and Ame finally exhaled, audibly relieved to get that out of her system.

Gura, packed tightly into Ame’s spats at ground zero, experienced hell on earth. Ame’s butthole twitched and erupted an eye-watering hurricane of semi-liquid gas directly into her helpless face with nary a second of warning. Gura valiantly held her breath as the winds tore past her ears and whipped the tears from her eyes, but the incredible pressure billowing from Ame’s fartbox simply *pushed* her rancid gas straight up Gura's tiny nose and down her throat. She didn’t have the physical power to force it out and was left frantically huffing Ame’s sweaty asshole like an oxygen mask.

“*Whew*!” Ame sliced the air in front of her face and giggled. The stench of rotting vegetables and stale bread hung thick in the room. “I swear they’re getting worse…” 

Chat responded obliviously:
[Huh? What’s getting worse?]
[why did she stop walking]
[treadmill broken?]
[Ame cute]
[nooo did something break]

“Oh, it’s nothing,” Ame said as she raised her leg and let another noisy one rip. All things considered, the smell was a little more manageable than usual. Perhaps her spats trapped most of it? “Just needed to stretch my legs n’ stuff.”

Ame resumed her walk, mashing her musky, sweaty, fart-drenched ass cheeks around Gura's body and baking her in the steamy remnants of her gas. Every delirious gasp Gura took meant taking in another lungful of that horrible aroma. She swallowed and swallowed, hoping the next breath would be *slightly* less saturated in Ame’s filth, but it never was.

Ina did her best to remain professional and manage the stream. Surely now there was no elegant way to free Gura from her fate, not after Ame did…*that*...to her. It would be best to let the stream play out and then fetch Gura’s abused body from the damp pile of spats when Ame undressed for her shower. As the scent of Ame’s bodily waste inevitably crept into Ina’s nose, she prayed that Gura was at least unconscious after getting gassed by something like that.

Ame was feeling much better now that some of the bloat was addressed and could go back to her planned topics of discussion. “Y’know chat, setting this up was a real pain in the ass. There were so many cameras I had to buy and figure out how to set up on the wall~ and my stupid laptop *kept exploding* when I ran all the programs! At least now I can-” Ame cut herself off, closed one eye and let out a lazy, bassy rumbler into her spats. This one didn’t have enough force to fully make it past her cheeks, conveniently saving her nose the pain of smelling any of it later. “*Ahhh*…Anyway, yeah, now I can do it in like ten minutes so it’s pretty cool. I’m kinda a pro, no big deal.”

Every minute that passed during the ensuing zatsudan caused more agony for Gura. She was squashed, gassed, and soaked in Ame’s increasing vulgar emissions in a never-ending cycle, riding the motion of the detective’s cheeks rolling over one another to the rhythm of the massive eternal treadmill below. Ame didn’t even bother stopping when she needed to fart anymore; she simply kept on walking and let her room-clearing farts bubble out between strides and wobble her cheeks as they sputtered haphazardly against her skirt. Some of them were relatively small and barely audible over the whine of the treadmill, others came out all at once in great trumpeting blasts and visibly bounced her cheeks, causing Ina to cringe internally at the implications for her tiny coworker’s survival.

As the clock struck three, Ame powered down the treadmill for good and stepped off. Her face was noticeably redder and slick with sweat. Ducking her head down to her armpits, she took note of the heady ripeness of her underarms. And a quick pat over her bum confirmed the total swamp ass gathering below. She *really* needed a bath.

“All right everyone! Thanks for coming to the stream~! Um, I’m gonna read supachats next time. Still haven’t decided what I’m gonna play yet. I’ll probably post about it tomorrow.” Slowing her breath, Ame picked up a tall rolled up yoga mat from the corner of the room and unfurled it onto the floor.

Ina’s eyes went wide. She had not been informed about this part of the stream. 

“But before we go I’m gonna do some cooldown stretches. You guys can ask me whatever, okay?” Ame stepped onto the mat and let her smelly stockings sink into the padded material. She aimed her butt at the mat, ready to take a load off and rest her aching feet.

Gura felt everything stop. For a short glorious moment she thought it was over. Then she was in free fall, her stomach thrown for a vicious loop as Ame’s hips fell through the air like a meteor.

**SLAP!**

Ame’s massive, sweaty bubble butt slammed into the mat, briefly pancaking on impact. It took a half second for all the fat in her ass to stop jiggling. She leaned back, flicking her bangs to the side. “*So* much better! That was more of a workout than I thought. You guys should try this at home! It’s important to…wait…”

Irritated, Ame looked down at her skirt. There was some kind of lump or bulge pressing into her from below. “Damn it…stupid cheap mats...” To Ina’s horror, Ame lifted herself off the ground, (leaving a noticeable shiny sweat stain in the exact shape of her twin moons behind) then *slammed* her hips back down with another meaty **PLAP**. She ground her cheeks into the mat from side to side and bounced in place to make sure she got whatever was poking her behind. It didn’t work; there was still that prickly feeling!

“What the heckuh? Come on!” Again and again, Ame crashed down with her full body weight, mercilessly ground-pounding the “lump” into the mat almost a dozen times. Soft crunches and muffled whines spilled out from under her ass on every heavy smack, not that Ame ever heard them. After working herself up and painting most of the area beneath her skirt in thigh sweat, Ame finally felt she had flattened it out properly. With a smug huff of victory, Ame wiggled comfortably in her seat and resumed taking questions from chat.

Gura could feel what was coming, but was wholly powerless to stop the blonde bombshell from repeatedly crushing her like a pillbug under her fat ass. The first impact exploded across her body like being broadsided by a freight train and nearly knocked her out. The following impacts (she couldn’t keep track of the exact number) just flattened her further and further until she was little more than another thin layer of cushioning separating Ame’s butt from the floor.

With the detective’s full weight bearing down on her, Gura couldn’t bend a finger, nevermind turn her head away for a breath of (relatively) untainted air. The majority of her face was swallowed by Ame’s foul-smelling butthole; only the furthest tips of her white hair were visible from outside the rim. She tried to wriggle free but it felt like she was encased in soft, warm cement and she only rubbed her face uselessly into the stinking, greasy wrinkles of her friend's asshole.

Gura’s lungs were being pressed flat. All the oxygen in her blood was slowly rotated out as she huffed the stagnant farts building up in the entrance of Ame’s backdoor. Her last gambit was to yell as loud as she could, hoping that it could at least cause enough of a sensation for Ame to investigate. After taking a deep breath of Ame’s most wretched odor, Gura belted from the bottom of her diaphragm into the pitch blackness of Ame’s ass.

Ame raised her eyebrows. A buzzing sensation tickled her butthole. She tried to ignore it, embarrassing as it was, but then it happened a second time. Weird.

Gura felt Ame’s hesitation when she stopped talking. It was working! Gura sucked down another musk-filled breath and opened her mouth nice and wide to belt out a third scream.

Ame pressed her lips tight and cruelly answered back with the loudest, most abhorrently wet fart of the afternoon, forcing Gura’s scream straight back down her throat along with a fresh load of rancid, gluten-fueled gas. It rumbled powerfully against her tiny face and exploded across the surface of the mat, effectively burying Gura's plea in a thick, foul avalanche of superheated stench. Huge bubbles of gas slipped out from under Ame’s heavy cheeks in short staggered bursts, rippling her ass fat on the way out and spraying fine showers of sweat along the mat. Some of the splash damage managed to reach all the way to the surrounding hardwood flooring.

Ina could feel her friend’s raucous fart travel through the floor and vibrate the bottom of her socks. It sounded like a row of tubas submerged in mud trying to clear their pipes at the same time. She would not have been surprised if Ame’s heavily noise-gated mic was forced to pick up the audio.

“‘Scuuuse me~,” Ame said, unbothered by the absolute bomb she’d just shook the floor with. The smell accosting the room had been upgraded from “off-putting” to straight up “nauseating”. All of Ame’s previous meals hit her nose with a vengeance and she ended up pressing down harder with her ass to make sure nothing else seeped out.

Another grumble tossed her stomach and Ame suddenly let out a noisy belch directly into the mic. The cramping continued. Ame knew she was taking a gamble with this next one, especially with how badly she needed to bomb the toilet, but she wanted to properly finish up her cooldown stretches. Also…she needed the mat to absorb most of the smell if she ever wanted to use this studio space again. 

Ame slid her legs in front of her, inadvertently resting all her weight on Gura’s small frame. She then leaned forward until her heavy tits rested on her thighs and reached for her toes in a forward bend. Ina averted her eyes.

A squelchy, drawn-out hiss sputtered from Ame’s ass for the next five seconds, interspersed with a loud wet slapping when particularly large pockets of gas built up enough pressure to escape from underneath. Ame continued diving her fingers forward for a better stretch, pulling her face into all sorts of focused and relieved expressions as she cruelly gassed out her tiny prisoner. 

Just as she was losing steam, Ame grunted and let loose a horrid rumbling fart to tortuously soak the mat in rancid waves of the nastiest, most concentrated gas that had been brewing up in her bowels for days. She almost felt herself lifted up by the powerful surge of gas pressing up from below and experienced a brief micro-panic that she pushed too hard.

Fortunately, she was safe. It *was* an disgustingly wet fart, and her crack was basically dripping now, but her hardy spats and the yoga mat managed to take most of it.

“Uh, yeah, I’m…I’m gonna call it here for today.” Ame said quietly, trying to contain her adrenaline. “There’s still a lot I have to do for the upcoming projects and stuff, but thanks for watching everyone! I’ll see you guys tomorrow for the superchats. Okay, bye~!” She turned off the stream and buried her face in her hands.

Without raising her head, Ame said, “Thanks again for your help, Ina. I know it was kinda last minute.”

Ina gulped. One way or another, it was over and she just needed to wait for Ame to take a shower. Gura would be fine. “Any time! Glad I could help.”

“And sorry about the…’hiccups’. My stomach wasn’t doing well today.” Ame rubbed her butt in small circles into the mat. A small two second fart bubbled out, the final insult to Gura’s nostrils. “God. And I ruined my favorite pair of spats, too. I definitely have to throw these out after today.” With that, Ame hoisted herself up (briefly sticking to the mat on the way up with all the sweat glued to her butt) and started peeling her spats down. They were loath to leave the skintight, balmy embrace of her cheeks but eventually plopped down onto the floor, defeated. She stepped out of them, not even sparing a parting glance at the miserable pile of retired undergarments she’d forced into servitude for all those years. 

“Ahh, freedom! …Uh, I’m gonna be in there for a while. Feel free to head home if you want. Thanks again, Ina!” Ame headed briskly towards the bathroom, keeping her steps short and her cheeks clenched.

Ina responded with a plastic smile and waited for Ame to leave. She then dashed to the middle of the room and saw Gura's tiny body nestled in the bundle of soggy spats. She was steaming with Ame’s odor, and every article of clothing on her small shark body was discolored. But she was still breathing.

Carefully, Ina extracted her friend from her confinement. The potion should wear off in an hour or two thanks to the small dosage. It’s unlikely either of them would willingly bring up what happened, and this whole nightmarish series of events could be safely ignored.

Still, logically, Ina had to acknowledge that a shrunken Holo made for an rather effective fart filter. Perhaps Lui had been on to something. Perhaps having someone down there could make an appreciable difference when it came to mitigating the smell during streams. Especially after a full meal of spicy noodles and kimchi; if someone *else* could be tasked with snorting that up…

Ina shook her head. She could never subject someone to that! She closed her mind to those thoughts and went to clean off Gura in the kitchen sink while Ame devastated her toilet.
