#Bunsy the bunny in Summer isn't Everything. (PT1)
##Featuring Riley the Racoon

**Spagonia, South West 12:00**

In the beaches of Spagonia, the family of Bunsy is enjoying a fine sunny day, the sun is hitting the hardest, the water is warm and the sand castle is just about done...
untill suddenly eggman carrier appears and ruins the sunny day, and starts talking in the intercom.
*"CITIZENS OF SPAGONIA, I AM TAKING OVER THE BEACHES OF YOUR LAND, IF YOU STILL CRAVE TO GET YOUR FEET WET, WE HAVE THE EGGPOOL AT YOUR LOCAL EGGBASE AVAILABLE WITH GOOD SERVICE!  ...AT A PRICE OFCOURSE! IN ANY CASE GET OUT FROM THE BEACHES IMMIDIEATLY BEFORE I SHALL SEND THE ROBOTS TO KICK YOU OUT FORCEFULLY!"*
the people act confused for such message for a couple of seconds, untill the intercom starts to repeat the message in spagonian language
to which it results in people starting rebel.

Eggman unsurprised for such responce, sends the robots, and the spagonian citizens were kicked out from the beaches, along with Bunsy's family.

**Empire City, City Center 8:00**

Bunsy was sleeping like a boulder, Bunsy had to draw the Circle of Hell of lust in full high detailed glory before going to sleep, so this was her break she was going to get, or rather, it was untill she recieved a message.

It was her Mum... She complained that a big robotic ship was ruining the fun of everyone, so Bunsy did the most sensical thing ever, and calls Tails...

=="Hello, you are calling the Miles 'Tails' Prower Workshop, how can i help you today?"==
"Hello? *yawns* It's me Bunsy... is sonic with you?"
=="Uhh... no, you want to leave a message for him?"==
"Yes... My mum has reported that apperently a robotic ship in the beaches of spagonia is sending robots to ruin the fun for everyone and the robots are kicking the people out, it's probably Eggman, can you look up for it?"
=="Umh... it does fit kind of Fit eggman description somewhat, il see if i... oh..."==
"What's wrong?"
=="I think Sonic can't help you with this Bunsy, Eggman robots have been reported assaulting Holoska."==
"Ugh...."
=="There is no need be down, is your family in hostage?"==
"Technically no, The robots just kicked em out of the beach."
=="Odd... can you tell as to why?"==
"Il see"
Bunsy then texts her mom in regards as to why these robots kicked them out, once she recieves the reason, she tells this info to tails.
=="That is just unfair, I would go there myself and deal with the problem but i need to work on fixing a lot of stuff today sadly, still i have an idea, Bring somebody you can trust and meet me at the workshop, i'l have a plan to help your family."==
"Thanks, il see you soon." Bunsy closes the call and does a deep breath... what a fucking way to start the day, good thing she knows somebody crazy enough to join her in this regard.
 
**Empire City, Junkyard 8:30**

Bunsy heads out to the junkyard of empire city, she searches her friend who she's doing stuff that all racoon do, rumaging in the trash.
Bunsy start knocking some trash for some attention, and then bursting from the wrecks her racoon friends comes out, dirty as always.
**Riley the Racoon** was her name, she is a messy, She's into technology, and she has enough money to commision Bunsy somehow.
Riley was looking at Bunsy very happily, and bunsy replies the emotion with a small smug then followed by her normal noNonsense expression.
"Buns, my girl, what brings you here today."
"Riley, il get to the point, Get yourself clean."
"WHAT!!!"
"We are going to take down a big robotical eggship and we require to have decent hygene to do so."

**Mystic Ruins, Outside Tails Workshop 9:30**

"Shiiet Buns, you didn't tell me you were friend with an actual tech guy from the resistance i keep hearing about.."
"Firstly, Tails is like 8, so keep your instinct in order if you can, though you can talk to each other about tech i guess."
"It's ironic hearing this from you Buns."
"Better be safe than sorry."

**Mystic Ruins, Inside Tails Workshop 9:31**

Bunsy knocks on the door of Tails workshop.
B:"Here we are Tails, i brought a friend as i requested."
Tails Opens the door welcoming Bunsy and Riley. 
T:"Splending! Please get inside il explain the plan in detail from-"
R:"Hey, is that one of the eggman's E100 machines?"
T:"Y-yes, how do you know about it?"
R:"... let's just say the junkyard of empire city has a lot of these E100 machines, mostly not as in good condition as this one."
T:"I see... anyway, before we get distracted let's get into the plan."

*A little later*

T:"So, to recap, i am going to fly you 2 into the EggCarrier, Riley, you are going to be sent inside the ventilation system and enter the carrier internal systems from there, plant the explosives to attract the attention of the robots, Bunsy, while this happens, you will get inside the the cockpit and redirect the ship away from Spagonia via this this USB, if in the case things go wrong Riley should have a spare, once everything is done, grab a parachute and or something to cover the fall and the problem should be resolved, we will be keeping communications using walkie talkies, any questions?"
B:"I have none if you are ok with me bringing weapons."
T:"... well as long as they do not hinder the mission it should be fine, watch out for civilians though, it might be possible that eggman has captured some that were resisting."
B:"Okay... but why Walkie talkies?"
T:"Mostly to keep you out of the radar, Eggman has neve actually made radars for these type of frequencies so it should be fine."
R:"Let's move quickly, then, i want to make the eggman have a Really! Bad! Day!"

**Spagonia, South West 16:20**

In the Skies as the sun still shines on the beaches of spagonia, Tails flies the Tornado 2 with Bunsy and Riley in the backseat (They have to share, as much as Bunsy's dislike and Riley's Pleasure.).
T:"We are getting close, RILEY, GET READY!!"
R:"Alright, ready! ...HUH?!"
Riley gets grabbed by the Tornado 2 claw, and then launched near the entrance to ventilation, doing a rough landing.
==T:"RILEY, COME IN, ARE YOU OK?"==
R:"Ugh... i am, the landing was slightly hard but i am fine..."
==T:"Okay... Sorry the throwing feature of the arm is still work in progress, still Get ready to climb in the trash Riley, and good luck, you are going to need it."==
R:"Thanks Tails."
*Returning to Bunsy.*
T:"Okay Bunsy, i am going to try to throw you to the top of the EggCarrier, from there you should be able to enter the Wheelhouse, you ready?"
B:"As long as isn't as hard as Riley i might be able to do it."
T:"Don't worry, i won't repeat the same mistake again!"
Bunsy gets grabbed by the claw and then she's launched into the top of the egg carrier, she lands more gracefully than Riley but not that much.
 ==T:"BUNSY, COME IN, ARE YOU OK?"==
B:"Somewhat fine, my legs hurt a little but i should be ok."
==T:"Alright then, Good Luck bunsy, and... oh no the defence system of the carrier have noticed me, and are starting to take aim, they might start also inspect your areas soon too, start moving quickly while i get out of the carrier view!"==
B:"Roger."
