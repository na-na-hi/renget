#Prompt Answers for Mio Katsuragi

!!! warning
	Does your MHA have a social media presence?
	Is it their real name, or their cape name, or do they have both?
	What do they post? Who do they follow?

Well duh! Feel free to follow me on all types of social media! My handle is usually some variation of "MioK", like "MeowK" or "MeOk". I follow all my friends, some celebrities, and a few heroes I really like! I run an active blog about my day and upload some things I'll talk about later in the hobbies section.

Of course, there's also the tons of bot accounts I have constantly scraping through all of the archives for any kind of juicy info they can find on someone. If someone's accidentally posted something they immediately regretted, I probably have a copy of it downloaded onto an external hard drive.

	Have you been a good hero today?
Maybe~

	How do you feel about your quirk?

Oh, I love my quirk! I simply wouldn't be Mio without it! It how I keep up with all the gossip around. I wouldn't trade it for the world!

	What deeds of 'heroism' have you done lately that you want Senpai to praise you for?

Oh, I taught one of the delinquents to listen properly more! Now she's much more compliant!

	Who is your favorite Pro Hero?

Toughie. I've been having my fun looking into the newer heroes like Honoken, but I've had my eyes on Majestic for quite a while~ I wonder what he would look like when he cracks? I bet he'd cry! He seems the type.

!!! warning
	Who do you think has the most potential, good or evil, among our up and comers?

Well, easy answer would be me. But I'm guessing you mean other than me, so... I've heard some things about one of Ash's classmates. That Imai guy. I think he has a lot of... potential with that quirk of his.

!!! warning
	What's your favorite snack?

I love love love those fizzy soda candies! I try not to get them too often so that they don't become boring to me. Usually only after special occasions.

!!! warning
	Do you jaywalk?

I mean, is there really any harm if nobody is driving by?

---

!!! warning
	What's your ultimate move called, what's it do?

My ultimate move? I don't think I'd call it that, but I guess my strongest attack would be something like erasing someone's memories completely. At that point, they're basically harmless. Then I could arrest them easy!

	Have you used it before? Did it work or fail spectacularly?

;)

---

!!! warning
	Do you plan to commission any tools or gadgets when you get the funds? If so who from?

I could use some more protective gear to help keep me safe. There are some really rude people out there who just can't be reasoned with. As for from who... I'll just have to pull a few strings and see what comes up.

---

!!! warning
	Do you have exceptional Willpower?

Weird question. I couldn't really say for sure because I try my best to prevent situations where I'd have to use it from happening. Prevention is better than a cure!

---

!!! warning
	What are your thoughts on the Night Parade?

Most of them I couldn't care less about. Petty thieves like Karma and drug dealers like Greenfinger are a dime a dozen. The one who really interests me in that group is Tatarimokke. Now that's someone I wouldn't mind rubbing elbows with some day. Despite being a known villain, he still manages to develop his own little spot within the city's wealthy. Even if he is a villain, I can really respect that.

!!! warning
	Which of the Pro Hero PCs would your character most want to intern under?

I'm not really a "go out and beat people up" kind of hero, so a lot of the current lineup doesn't work for me. I guess if you twisted my arm, I'd say Popsy since she's too busy being miserable to make me do anything I don't want to do.

---

!!! warning
	What kind of hero do you want to become? When you save the day, what do you want the civvies to think? Do you want admiration? Reverence? Do you want them to get hyped up about your existence or do you want to be a calming presence?

When I step into the room, I want people to know that the problem is solved. People will look at me and believe that because I'm there now, there's no need to worry about the crime in question anymore. Of course, I wouldn't be unhappy if people started cheering and revering me.

!!! warning
	What kinda coffee do you like?

Don't drink it. Sorry not sorry.

---

!!! warning
	Let's talk residencies and bases of operation.

I'd rather not. Ash has already talked about home, so that'd be pretty superfluous.

!!! warning
	Hobbies/Hidden Talents

I'm mushing these two together because they're the same thing for me. When I'm not doing school stuff or looking into the next juicy piece of info, I like making remixes of songs and posting them online. I can't play any instruments and I'm not a professional singer, but I can edit.

!!! warning
	What do you think your biggest flaw is?
	Not in terms of strength, but in personality.
	Where do you fall short as a person?

I'd say I'm very prone to obsession. I fall in love with a song, I listen to it like fifty times in a day. I find a new favorite café, I go there for a month straight. I find someone I'm interested in, I have to find out everything about them. Thankfully these waves pass eventually and I move onto newer better things.

---

!!! warning
	What's your greatest strength? Personality-wise, that is.

I'm veeeery thorough and careful with my work. I make absolutely sure I've gotten everything figured out and that I'm certain I'm going to come out on top before striking. If I'm making my move, you've already been caught in my web. I haven't had my plans blow up in my face yet for this very reason.

	What are you going to be up to during the Shiketsu sports festival? Will you be attending, and if so, for what reason?

I'll be in the senior section, duh!

---

!!! warning
	Who do you think is your biggest threat to winning the festival? Any plans on how to take them out? Maybe you're hoping to eliminate them on an earlier round, or maybe you've got a "surefire" strategy for the duels.

Like I said, I'm really not the fighting type, so I'm not looking to win. I'll just have fun playing the games and taking part in the side events.

!!! warning
	Aside from family or friends, what person would you say has positively impacted your life the most?


Maybe a weird answer, but the doctor I had when I was a kid. The first time I had used my quirk it to its fullest potential was when I was still young. I accidentally stumbled upon a memory in my doctor's head with him cheating on his wife. I didn't really understand what he was doing at the time, but I knew he didn't want people to know. Oh, when his face fell and turned to horror... the way he was resigned to give into any demand I wanted... it was a defining moment in my life I can't forget. It put me on the path I'm on now!

---

!!! warning
	What would you say is your most prized possession?

Some very special piece of evidence tucked away somewhere nobody can find it. If things ever get completely out of hand, I know I have that ace in the hole to help me get out of it. Evidence of what? Secret~

---

!!! warning
	So a 2-for-1 today, friends. What is your biggest regret, and what's a really trivial one you still think about?

Biggest regret... Probably not getting to know many of the students in the grades above me before they graduated. A real missed opportunity to not meet someone like Atsushi-senpai.

For a smaller one, that's gotta go to the time I showed some friends an old video I remember being really funny and it was... God, none of them laughed even a little. It was so awkward and it keeps popping up in my brain when I'm trying to sleep.

---

!!! warning
	So how do you blow off steam?

When I'm feeling like a boiled lobster, I usually rent a private room at one of the karaoke places and belt my heart out by myself until I start feeling better. It almost always works really well!

---

!!! warning
	What is your happiest memory? A single moment you remember to this day, that reminds you of good times (whether that makes you feel better or worse about where you're at now).

Oh, I have so many happy memories, it's hard to choose just one! But if I had to pick... I would pick the time in middle school I got my teacher to let me miss class whenever I liked after I found out that she likes to take illegal drugs in the teacher's lounge when nobody else is around. What a fun year of school that was!

---

!!! warning
	How did you come up with your hero name?

Well, it's not really creative, is it? I'm sure someone else could come up with something better, but I've gotten pretty attached to it now. It's cute!

---

!!! warning
	Does your character play /tg/?

Uh, no. That's pretty dorky shit. Well, I guess something like a board game could be fun as long as the stakes were interesting enough. Just playing normally, though? I'm good, thank you.

---

!!! warning
	We all have guilty pleasures that we indulge in from time to time, whether it be food, activities, or something else. What's yours?

I do not play Yu-Gi-Oh. No, I don't. I don't go to tournaments in disguise and anyone who tells you otherwise is trying to defame me.

---

!!! warning
	Do you participate in any clubs, and if so, how do you feel about how they are run?

I'm part of the studio crew that records the school's events! We're the whole reason your parents get to see you during your big day if they can't make it personally. I'm head editor, so I get a lot of say in how the club is run. As long as everyone else knows their place, we work together wonderfully!

---

!!! warning
	Aside from the obvious answer of "your home," what's your favorite place to go? Whether to calm yourself down or cheer yourself up, what's a place you find yourself returning to often to feel better?

This feels very similar to a previous question, so my answer is the same! Karaoke places! Whether I'm alone or bringing a group with me, I always find myself having a great time there.

---

!!! warning
	You've won the lottery! What are you doin' with it?

Oh, if I'm being honest, I'll probably end up wasting a lot of it on splurging on stuff like clothes and jewelry. Other than that, I'd get a new place and move out of my parent's house. Too many bad vibes there!

---

!!! warning
	What is something you're especially afraid of?

I may hide it very well, but having all of my playing with people come to a head like this was some kind of dumb PG-13 movie does scare me. Like that kind of thing of "The nerds beat the cool girl and now she's going to be ruined!" Pretty ridiculous, I know, but it's part of the reason why I'm always so careful about choosing who and when to bully someone.

---

!!! warning
	What's the fastest way for someone to get on your bad side with minimal effort?

Yanking on my hair. Instantly on my shit list. It's happened before when I was younger and I made sure they never even **thought** of doing it again.

---

!!! warning
	What small things do people do that make you think of them more favorably?

Actually taking an interest in and complimenting my music. I like doing those remixes quite a lot and I do put in a real effort to make them sound cool, so someone who likes them obviously has good taste.

---

!!! warning
	What's your motivation to do what you do? Why do you want whatever your goal is?

It's all about putting myself in a position where I can leverage it over most other people. It's about having my fun in the safest way possible. You can't always count on others to keep you safe. Real safety is the kind you make for yourself. Not to mention being a hero is such a nice way to appear nice and helpful to everyone. I want people to look up to me, in awe or in fear depending on who it is.

---

!!! warning
	What’s the absolute cruelest, most character-destroying thing someone could say to you?

"I know where you're hiding it all."

---

!!! warning
	What is your go-to strategy in battle? Against multiple foes? Against one big powerful enemy?

Turning around and getting the hell out of there because I've obviously entered somewhere I really shouldn't have. If I can't get away, chunking out people's memories of me and *then* getting out of there.

!!! warning
	What's your favorite bug!!! On a completely unrelated note, what's your favorite bodily organ!!!!

Get away from me, I have pepper spray.

	Lights On or Off?

On~
