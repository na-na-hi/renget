**Name:** Logren Wight
**Face:** Rough, unshaven, and often bruised with angular, elongated features. He has a slightly upturned nose, a scarred over clawmark over his left eye, and large goofy ears.   
**Hair:** Ghostly white following an encounter with a Banshee. Unkempt and poorly maintained. 
**Eyes:** Blue
Height: Massive. 
**Bodytype:** Logren is sometimes described as "an odd beast." One of the tallest boys in his year, and strong as an ox, he's more lanky and awkward than muscular. More closely resembling a huge, gangly gibbon. 
**Complexion:** His skin is incredibly pale and marred by plentiful scars; the origins of which you may often catch him describing in possibly exaggerated detail, shortly before being shouted at to put his shirt back on in the middle of the hallway. 
**Uniform variation:** Unwashed, beaten to hell, full of holes and frayed edges. Usually wears an old formless hat that the faculty has grown tired of asking him to remove.

**Voice:** It is entirely possible Logren has no control over the volume of his own voice. He is loud to the point of obnoxiousness, and has a bad habit of sneaking up on friends and classmates before scaring them out of their robes with a booming greeting in a thick Irish accent. 

**Body language:** Logren is sluggish and lazy. Usually leaning against somethin or crouching on some odd perch, he tends not to be very animated.

**Social:** Logren doesn't have many- if any- close friends. Instead acting more open and friendly to just about anyone; from total strangers to classmates. Although he's at least familiar enough with passing classmates to leap at them and attempt to drag them into whatever shenanigans he's gotten himself into, a combination of his imposing stature, obnoxious attitude, and a preference to laze about on his own or fly off on his own without telling anyone, means very few tend to approach him, and fewer still stick around. Still, you can always expect him to be found getting a post-match drink at The Hog's Head with the rest of the Gryffindor quidditch team, groggily lifting his teammates on his shoulders, singing old folk songs, and merrily showing off new scars.

**Visibility:** Logren is a freak of nature, he tends to stand out in crowds. Although, the idea of crowded places makes him incredibly anxious. You'd be more likely to find him scurrying up the castle's buttresses or napping in a secluded courtyard. 

**Engagement:** He won't shy away from approaching even total strangers if there's reason to, and will happily drag anyone foolish enough to approach him into latest shenanigans or favorite stories, but he's otherwise nervous in social settings and will typically slink off away from crowds.

**Quirks:** He always seems miles away. If you've caught up to him to get his attention for some reason, chances are he won't actually stop whatever he's doing to speak to you. Alternatively if you've caught him lazing about in the sun as he's so often found, good luck keeping him interested enough to stay awake through the conversation.  

**Things your character wouldn't do:** It is honestly a very short list. Being as brash and dumb as he is, he can be talked into just about anything by the right person. He has little respect for rules or authority, and would never shy away from a fight- in fact, although Logren isn't exactly a "bully" he does seem to find whatever excuse he can to settle grievances 'without magic'- though it would be incredibly rare for him to instigate one or pick on someone deliberately. The one thing the boy could never do is do anything to disappoint his caretaker, Nanny. Worry her to near death, sure, but what Nanny says, goes. 

**Animals:** As a boy he would usually be found chasing gnomes around the garden or hunting for leprechauns in the forest near his home. Logren has a soft spot for beasts, magical or otherwise. Although he does seem to dislike cats for whatever reason. Logren is an Animagus in training. Having practiced from a young age thanks to a book his Nanny would read to him about the art, his study of the technique is just about the only thing he pays attention to in class. Logren has since discovered that his animal is a rather large elk- or a moose, if a handful of playful nicknames are accurate- which he has had a spotty record of actually turning into. In one piece, at least. In particularly dire straights, it's likely he'd be able to fully transform and give his friends an emergency lift. 

**Misc information that might be useful:** Logren is dumb. Logren is so, so dumb. He's well meaning and surprisingly worldly with decent instincts, but such things can only take him so far. He has an uncanny ability to completely miss the point of any conversation with even the smallest amount of subtlety, his approach to almost any conflict is to keep hitting it until something happens, and the most planning he will dedicate to just about any situation is to run in screaming his own name while the rest of his friends are distracted coming up with an actual course of action.

**Writing hooks**
Logren is always getting himself into trouble. Be it by starting a fight with a student he thought was insulting him (they weren't), and landing the two of them in detention, hunting rare creatures through spider infested woods and "adopting" a baby thornback he snuck into the Gryffindor common room, dragging (you) along on a long and winding mission to find a hidden chamber in the school that someone tricked him into believing in, or just staying up scrubbing the great hall with a hair brush as punishment for skipping potions for the third week in a row. 

He'd be a common sight in the hospital wing and wandering around doing something stupid off school grounds. Stories like "did you hear Logren managed to set half the quidditch pitch on fire when he snuck fire-breathing potions into the Slytherin team's canteens?" would be a common enough occurrence. If something incredibly stupid has happened, is in the process of happening, or needs another well meaning moron to start the call to adventure, Logren is typically a main culprit. 

He's also an imposing figure on the quidditch field, regardless of his staggering incompetence, and could provide a literal wall for challengers to surmount.
