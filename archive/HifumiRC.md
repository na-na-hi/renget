>Nyoro Hoge HN "Maru" (Unknown Class Rep): https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88273837 / https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88758766

*For… I'm sorry, I keep forgetting her name… Nyoro was it? Our class rep. Inigo's gir- … Inigio's friend. She's like a ninja. Very hard to spot, but you can lock down on her right? Well, imagine that when you finally do that, I teleport her out, and you gotta try that again. Would be super irritating to fight.*

I found out recently that we're actually cousins. I've been looking for a chance to ask her to help me with math, but somehow always miss the chance. I'm not really good at it, and thought that she could help. Like, not only my grades, but also, I tried to pay extra attention in physics class, cause it might help my Quirk. I may have some intuitive grasp when it comes to kinetics, but sometimes I get stumped and knowing the numbers behind might help.
She's a stickler for the rules, but not that very annoying about it. Maybe it's just the influence of Inigo, but I choose to believe she's just that cool. Seems to take on herself more than she should. When it comes to hard work, I think she's number one in class, but should learn to relax more, hopefully hanging out with Inigo will help with that.
She's hanging out with Chihiro nowadays. I wonder if she'd be opposed to me taking her student to kendo club practice. She seems to be more of a style purist, but I think mixing stuff up a bit can help. If even not to learn some of our moves, she could just use it to spar with people with a bit different style than what she's used to.

>Chihiro Mitsurugi HN "Ascetic Sword Hero: Yako": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88189202

*For Chihiro, we're both swordsmen, so it would be a pretty cool combo. Her style is more traditional, and she's suuper fast. I think she'd be the core of our combo, with her engaging the target, while I jump in and out to create openings for her or using those she makes for me. I can also jump on those that are out of her range and keep them there so she can close the distance. Since I also just jump in and out, I could stay out of her drain area mostly.*

Chihiro is very cool. Her skills with the sword are among the best I've ever seen. After I cleared up the misunderstanding with Hay, I dropped by her dojo a couple times, but less than I'd like. I'm a bit short on time lately tbh. I think we can both learn a bit from each other. Maybe I could help her incorporate some more unconventional moves into her gameplan, while she could help me polish the more traditional approach. If nothing else, sparring another swordsman is always valuable, in our case especially when it comes to reflexes.
I don't know how she does it, but she comes up with some great lines. Does it happen naturally after living like a hermit for years? I like hanging out with people too much to test that out, so I think I'll just borrow her lines from time to time.
I heard that meetup with the others I set up went well. She seems to be opening up to others lately. It can't be easy for her, so it's even more impressive. I can't say I'm an expert, but I can only hope that those baby steps will lead to one day her waking up and realising she no longer blames herself for what happened.

>Soujyuuro Imai HN "Wise Eye Hero, Mahoudeva": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88194077 (further information at https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88698235)

*For Sojuro, he could be the mastermind with his mind reading, creating a battleplan for us and adjusting it as needed, and he's also a very good at fighting, so I wouldn't have to worry about that. I think he could also help prevent potential ambushes I might get into with my quirk.*

I still bother him to help me with mushin practice from time to time. I think I'm getting better at it, but still not there to go for a full contact spar. Sadly, haven't had a chance to hang out with him much outside of that.
He's close with Chris, isn't he? And his relationship with Ashleigh seems to progressing, even if it seems to be going very slow. I thought they'd go at it faster with how clear it is they are attracted to each other. They both seem to be very shy. I dunno if it's just how they are, or because of that dumb love ban. Or maybe he's just intimidated by Ashleigh's sister? He seems a bit wary every time he sees her. Maybe he should talk about it with Sandy? 

>Bobby Samson HN "Sunlight Man": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88190591

*For Bobby, it would work similar to Chihiro, he's great in a fight and could build that strong team core. I think I could also help him out in situations such as when fighting in buildings and such, where the sun doesn't get to, cause I could get him out for a quick recharge as long as the sun is out outside. I know him well enough, to be confident that I could do that quickly. Also if the fight is dragging on for too long, I could help us get out, before he runs out of batteries.*

Muh Bro, muh Sun. Probably the person I hang out the most with except for Hay. We hit it off since day one. We just vibe together.
We sit next to each other in class and often end up distracting each other, so it probably doesn't help our grades, but hey, you gotta chill sometime. And we do help each other study a bit! Languages mostly. I help him with Japanese and he helps me with English. We also hit the gym and spar together, but we are a bit of a mismatch there. If he goes all out using his quirk, I can't even spot him. But hey, it's always good to have a gym-buddy to help motivate you. In ring, he outboxes the shit out of me, so sparing on those rules is also skewed, but I can help him with some drills, and in grappling sessions I'm a bit better technically.
I'm very happy he hit it off with Minnie. Gives us even more of a chance to hang out together on double-dates, and they look happy together. I've seen some girls from other classes staring with envy at her, but I think even they got to approve of this match.

>Sora Tanaka HN "The area master hero, Orbit": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88191735

*For Sora, I think he'd try to keep targets in place and open them up to me, and if needed I could help him out if someone does manage to get on his ass. If we practiced it, I could also help him get into range quickly by teleporting him into it. Also, that plan I have to increase my punching power? It relies on using gravity, so he could help me with that.*

He's a bit weird. Like, he lacks the heroic passion, I think. I've heard he's just in it for the license. I hope hanging out with us and going through all that practice will help him grow into the spirit. But hey, he passed the exams, so clearly, he has something in him. 
I managed to drag him once to help me with the falling style, and it was great practice, but he complained it was boring and cut it short. I guess, he just felt he doesn't grow from it himself? I should find some way to help him with that, maybe then it'll work for him too.

>Kaylee Suzuki HN "Flying Force": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88438219

*For Kaylee, she's another one of the "party core" ones. I don't think we have any special combos beyond that, but she's just very good at that role, so I think we'd still be very cool together. I'd like to get to know her better on a more social level though, so I could help her burry the hatchet with someone else.*

Since the rivalry died down a bit, I managed to hang out with her a bit more. Mostly at the gym, but it’s something. She's the type that's a bit over reliant on her athleticism. Like, she's super blessed in that department, but a bit hyper-fixated on it. She like to spar a lot, but she goes ape-mode in it, so it doesn't really help her technique much. I think instead of just throwing weights around all the time, she should focus a bit more on the martial arts. A proper technique, like a weapon, is a force multiplier. She already has a shitload of force, so increasing that is diminishing returns, and it'd be better for her to focus on the multiplier itself.
Form what Inigo told me, she's hangs out a lot with Chris and they might have hit it off, but in the end, he went the other way. I wonder if it's just cause she's so obsessed with battles (I guess I can respect that level of passion), or just because they weren't each other's type. I wonder what her type is.
The rivalry died down, but I think some enmity is still there, and if not that, then a lot of awkwardness. We still have over two years to smooth it out, but the sooner the better.

>Shinkan Sen HN "Crazy Train": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88194200

*For Shinkan, he's not exactly the "party core" from the get go, but the longer the fight goes, the more he settles into that role. I think I could buy him time to reach that point, and if need be, I could probably do a quick trip to a shop to get him coal and feed it to him mid battle for that extra boost.*

I like him. He sits in front of me in class, and with how big his head is, he blocks my vision a bit, but he seems he knows that, so he often leans on the window to help me see better (or maybe he's just napping?). He's another one I see in the gym often. I like his sense of humour. The train whistle on the punchline makes his jokes twice as funny. 
People can be pretty spooked by his appearance, but I think he's really a cool guy once you get to know him. 

>Hifumi Takeda HN "Warp Blade Hero: Challenger": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88196397 (further information at https://controlc.com/d631ca64, https://controlc.com/df84e4c3, https://controlc.com/805e7f25)

That's me.

>Minerva Kim HN "Spark": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88826766

*For Minnie, I think I'd play more the role of the core here, while she would be the big red button. We'd have to work on it a bit, but imagine that I'm fighting someone and I blink out, he thinks that "ha, he's gonna appear behind be to attack me like that", but I don't instead I went to grab her, and appeared a couple meters away from the villain, so she can surprise shock him. She can also do a lot of cool things with her quirks outside of combat, and if for example the control panel is somewhere hard to access, I could help her get there.*

Minnie is cool. She's kinda like the group-mom of the Clique, but seeing how she melts when she's with Bobby is cute. Those two are great together. I think he's good for her. She needs someone she can rely on like that I think. I think back in Korea she had more people like that, but here she had to be strong for the rest of the girls.
We haven't hanged outed much without Bobby and Hay, and when we do it's usually still about them, like setting up some plans to hang out together, or passing messages, or asking for help with some surprises, or something like that. I think she's still a bit angry about that time I took Hay to the roof, but overall, I think we get along.

>Hailey Chang HN "Recoil": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88826770 (further information at https://controlc.com/ff25b455)

*For Hay, I'd play the core again, while she uses long range attacks, and supports me. If someone closes the distance on her, I can also quickly help her reposition, cause she's probably the easiest one for me to do that with.*

I hope Rosethorn ain't listening (even if she knows, Hay thinks we still have to keep up the pretence because of that dumb rule), but damn do I love this girl. I think that what makes good couple is that they feel good together, but also that they aren't complacent and push each other to be better every day. And I think we have that.
Hay puts on a tough act, but it's because she's just worried, ya know? People think that the rich have it so great, but when I hear some stories about what she went through, I have to say I'm glad my family was poor. She's been hurt a lot, so she put up that wall of bitchiness to protect herself. I think it ain't the best way out, and I think she realizes that too, so I try to help her tear it down. She ain't quite there yet, but she's trying her hardest.
And outside of that, what's there not to love about her? Talking with her is just a joy. She can just help the convo flow so well. Hours can pass, and you'll flow from one topic to another without even noticing the time fly by. She's very knowledgeable about lots of things and attentive to what I say. Even if it doesn't seem like it, she really listens to you, ya know? And that voice, I could listen to it for days.
But I love spending time with her even when we aren't talking. I find her absolutely adorable. Ya know how people look at Noah and it's like he has this halo, this aura of holiness kinda? Well, she has that in my eyes. She's my angel. Just looking at her brightens my day. She's beautiful, the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. Her smile is just disarming. And she just grows more beautiful every day, though I don't know if it's not just because I feel myself just falling for her more and more.
And I love cuddling with her. Her skin is just so smooth and soft. And her perfume smells absolutely intoxicating. And the way she clings to me just makes my heart melt. Really makes me want to protect her. It may be for the best that we don't sit next to each other in class or I wouldn't be able to focus on studying at all.
So yes, in short, I like her a lot.

>Faith Kang HN "Drone": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88826774

*For Faith, I think either I'd play core, or her drones would. They would be very useful supports, and I could help her get materials for them, by either bringing it to her with my quirk, or carrying her to it. I could also help transport her drones to hard to access places, and they could scout for me, so I could access some places I couldn't too.*

She's a very sweet girl. When Hay told me about how hurt she was when Inigo pulled that stunt, it made me want to kick his ass the second time. I hope she finds someone good for her. 
She's very smart and her quirk is neat too. With how vulnerable she seems to be, I think she might be better off in a support course, but I guess she has her reasons to be here. Whether it's just wanting to stay with others, or if that's her effort to try to toughen up a bit, I can't judge her for picking that path. Especially with how the Fight Club went…

>Maxine Nguyen HN "Radius": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88826778

*For Max, I think she'd play the core, cause she could hold down multiple targets to create the opening for me. I could also surprise drop her on someone so she could incapacitate them.*

Max has a sharp tongue. I wonder if it's just a defensive mechanism like with Hay, or is it just how she is. She seems to look down on others a lot, like she's treating the world like a show just playing for her amusement. We haven't actually interacted that much, so I just hope I'm wrong. She does seem to stand by her friends, though, and that's a good quality, so there is no reason there can't be others behind it.
If Minnie is the official group-mom, she seems a bit like a backup. There to help out when things help out when things break down or when it's Minnie that has a crisis. Being reliable like that also seems nice. I think if she gets passionate about it (outside of just Quriks, she's very knowledgeable about those), she'll make a great hero one day.

>Edith Lee HN "Arena": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88826782 (further information at https://controlc.com/c70e6fcb)

*For Eddie, I think we'd actually be a pretty scary combo. One of her biggest problems is getting into range, right? Well with me it wouldn't be. And I have a problem of grabbing someone I don't know with me when I teleport, right? Well with her I wouldn't have. I just grab her, teleport wherever we need to go, she grabs whatever or whoever we need from there, I return ass. Sweet combo both for combat, rescue, defence and all around. Her TikTok account is also very popular, so we could even approach the Social angle through it.*

She seems to follow the others around mostly, like she's a bit lost, but when it comes to hero stuff, she seems like one of the most skilled among the Clique. I wonder if she's this support type, or is it just because she's the youngest of the group. I think she has a great potential, but like other from the Clique, should get over the defensive posturing.

>Noah Abrams HN "Archangel 「 大天使 - Dai Tenshi 」": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88205041 

*For Noah, I'd play the core. He's a ranged fighter (though he's been working on melee too, I wonder if he finally settled on what style he's gonna pursue, gotta ask him later), so the method would be similar to the one with Hay, though I wouldn't be as good as teleporting him as I am with her, he has wings though so his mobility is better without that. Also sunlight shenanigans like with Bobby. I think our special move, would be me teleporting him in, he flashbangs everyone, my eyes are closed so I'm not susceptible to it, and I practiced fighting with my eyes closed a lot anyway, so we can exploit that surprise effectively.*

He's the class mascot in a positive sense. He helps the class out a lot. There isn't really anything bad you can say about his personality. I just wonder if he's not trying too hard to please others, and sacrificing himself in the process. Hopefully, Sally will help him take care of himself. I think it's good that he decided to hit the gym more. Shows that he pays attention to himself since he tries to address his weaknesses, so maybe I'm just worried for nothing. How can you not worry about him, though? 

>Victor Sigurd HN "HYDRA": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88209661

*For Victor, I'm not quite sure which one of us would play the core, but I think we'd get along anyway. I could also help him get to water sources he can use (as usual, we'd have to practice that first).*

He got transferred to 1E. He's not taking it that well. We still talk a bit, but we weren't that close. The "Water Inertia" speeches were somewhat tiresome. Hope he does well in his new class, though.

>Inigo Myoga HN "Dragon Hero Ryu-kishi": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88414797 (further information at https://controlc.com/6b9d6748)

*For Inigo, I think I'd be the core. His quirk is super versatile, but his combat skills aren't that great. He's more of a Generalist I think, so he could handle his own defence for a while I deal with remote targets, but I think our core combo would be him preparing some big surprise, and I then help him get in range for it, but I'm actually not quite sure how it'd work with Gigan. I guess we're gonna have to practice some set pieces like that first.*

Muh boy. He rubs a lot of people wrong the first time they meet him, but you get used to it after a while. I'm super glad he got together with Hoge, because the stuff he pulled when he was single was really fucking dumb and hurtful to others. And they seem to be good for each other (even if she refuses to admit it). She's super stiff, he's super relaxed, they average out. I hope she continues to work on him and direct him towards better ways to spend all that energy.
Gigan is a great Quirk (and quite cute), so I think Inigio will achieve his dream of becoming a rescue hero quite easily. I think we'll compete hard for the rankings in the future. 
He keeps trying to push me to play those VNs of his, but I have enough teasing from Fuji-nee as is. I'm not gonna give her more ammo by coming home with "Boing Boing Heroines 10" or whatever.

>Christopher "Chris" Cain HN "Mirror Devil": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88217649

*For Chris, he's smart as hell, so he'd also be great as setting a battleplan, so I'd leave that to him, but if I had to propose something, I think who plays the core depends on which quirks he has. He could probably play either role, though like with Inigo, very versatile quirk, but his own combat skills aren't that great. He copies my quirk often, so it's clearly useful for him, but then he's limited to one other quirk right? If I could handle the movement, he could have two other quirks at the same time, which would probably be rather strong. We'd have to practice first, but I think since we both used my quirk, it wouldn't be that hard to get proficient at it.*

I tried to talk to him multiple times, but he seems to avoid me for some reason. With how often he uses my Quirk, he could at least hang out with me too. Maybe we could exchange insights on using it? It's like he doesn't see much in me beyond my Quirk. I wonder how I can change that. Maybe talk about our favourite hero's Quirks? Ask him to teach me to play chess? I'm not big on Arcade so probably not that.

>Son Jugo HN "Aspara": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88239137

*For Jugo, it's tough to say which would be the core. He's great at range, so tactics for those would work, but he's also good in melee. I guess it'd end up similar to how it'd go with Chihiro? Also possibly me going to someone and keeping them in place, while he charges big attacks, and then I get out at the last minute.*

He's a bit like Kaylee, but he did put more effort into polishing his technique, so even if he's not as blessed physically, I think I'd bet on him in a fight. 
He has some pretty radical ideas at times, that I'm not sure I agree with. Especially after he finds Hiro's locker, he goes on rants that can be pretty scary. I wonder if he's planning to get into politics in the future.

>Ashleigh Katsuragi HN "Blackout": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88268251 (further information at https://controlc.com/39a2773c)

*For Ashleigh, I think we'd work together great. I get us in, she uses her quirk, I get us out for that one minute, then we jump in again to exploit the confusion without carrying much risk while waiting for it to go active. She could also help when someone starts to read my quirk too much.*

We hang out sometime. I liked those comics from her and she seems to like Holyland. We sometimes stay after Ippon's class to ask about some technique or other so there is also that. She trains a lot with Hay too, so there is plenty of chances to talk. With how shy she is, getting her to talk isn't easy though. She also helps me with English. Like I practice with Bobby and Hay too, but sometimes when I don't get something, they can have a problem explaining it in Japanese, and Ash is better at that.
I think she and Imai are good together, but watching them is a bit irritating with how slow they are.

>Atsushi Orochi HN "Hard to Destroy Lizard Hero - Yamata": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88273479 (further information at https://controlc.com/48f0874f)

*For Orochi, she's clearly the core. She's very cool, and I think it'd work great. She's super tough, can disable targets, strong etc. Probably similar tactic as with Max. She lacks a bit in mobility department, and she's a melee combatant, so I could help her get into that range.*

She's cool. I think we'd get along, but somehow, we never find the time to hang out together outside of training. Might be because I don't go to the Arcade much.
It's a shame I wasn't there to help when she had a run-in with that Villain, but luckily Chris had my Quirk ready, so I guess I kinda did help too. I hope that incident will just leave her with extra motivation to become a hero.

>>>Government Sponsored

>Sandatsu Owari HN "Reaper": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88192177 (further information at https://rentry.org/akhke)

*For Sandatsu, I think it's hard to judge, as his quirk seems to be developing still, but I think we could come up with something. If his quirk is close range, I can help him get in. If his quirk is longer range, I can help him get out. If it's a mix, we can mix up the tactics. A lot of cool options probably.*
	
Muy boyo. He's the silent, mysterious type mostly, but sometimes he can throw a line that will just crack up all of us. He seems very lost in his thoughts usually. He got into a relationship with Ashleigh's sister not long ago, so I'd assume she's thinking about her, but the way he stares off in the distance at times makes me think it might not be that. He is hard to read though.
I think he will do well as a hero, but more of a niche one. His Quirk might be hard to market, but I think he'll have some hardcore fans.

>>>Sophomores (Held Back)

>Yui Sagara HN "The Binding Hero, Capture Cloth": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88383012

*For Yui, I think it'd go with a similar style to Max and Orochi, but sadly, I don't think I could really benefit from her quirk, cause I don't think we would be able to utilize that connection much. Teleporting both her and someone else at the same time so that she can connect them together isn't something I can do at this time I think. Though maybe that connection of her, would actually help me with that? I don't know, we're gonna have to try it out.*

Yui is cool. We sit on the opposite side of the class, but I don't think we're opposites when it comes to personality. I'm glad she and Hay have resolved their issues… somewhat. The gifts she left us were pretty neat.
She's more experienced than most of us, so she often offers helpful advice for the rest of us. She has some quite radical views about here society at times, but I think that's mostly due to her Villainous past, and she'll come around in time. And I cheer her on to do that. After all, who doesn't like a good comeback story?

>Kyoda Hiro HN "Overdose": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88193619

*For Hiro, I think he could buff me and make me scary this way, but he also has some tranquilizers, right? I could help him get in range to apply them. He also can play the medic right? I could help him get to those in need.*

Hiro is cool, but he seems to have a somewhat hard time mingling with the rest of the class. Like he feels awkward being older than us, but also doesn't really hang out with his old class much. I hope that by the second year he'll truly feel like he's one of us. I already think about him as such
I think his Quirk is risky PR-wise but he has what's needed to make it work. He's really smart, and I think he thinks the way he explains it can be too difficult for others to understand, so they think it's extra scary. Sure, there are some drawbacks to it, but it's not like those are normal drugs. I think it's similar to Rosethorn's just in a different form. I think him getting into her class might actually been lucky for him. She might be able to really help him develop it not only from the practical side, but also from the way he presents it to others.

>Genma "Kinji" Gō HN "Goldorado": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88353862

*For Genma, I guess it'd be somewhat similar as with Eddie? I don't know him that well. Is it true he's going to get transferred to another class?*

We've hanged out more since Fight Club, and I think it's a bit of a shame that he got transferred. We still talk, but not as often as we used to. He gave me a rid on his bike once, was pretty cool.

>>Class 1-D...+!
>>>Sophomore

>Sally McCathy HN "Last Rite": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88810810

She's even more American than Bobby, so she seems to miss USA even more than he does. I hope she grows to like Japan. Maybe if we help her make fond memories of this place, she'll change her mind? Especially with Noah, I think she'll come around soon. After all, will she be able to hate the country where on every corner she'll see a spot where she spent time with him?
She has some anger issues she needs to work through. I run with a sword and that requires a lot of self-control, when her Quirk is guns, I can only imagine it needs even more. I think it's because she kinda tries to run away from her problems instead of facing them properly, but that can be scary so I get why she does that. I hope she'll have the strength to do that one day.

>Takara Tame HN "Android": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/89199766

The robot girl? I heard she wants to make friends, but doesn't really make the first move. I talked with her a couple times, but we didn't find many common topics in the short time we had.

I don't think I've ever heard of him, he's in our school?

>"Fasto Mann" (DECEASED): https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88310624

I think I heard something about that incident as a cautionary tale in one of Rosethorn's classes.

>>Supporters

>Isaiah Sibylla: https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88231241

I think I passed him by in school a couple times, we have quite a lot of foreigners, but not many of them black. I don't think we've ever spoken, but I heard he has a teleportation quirk too.

>Aura Curie: https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88231609

I've seen her speak with Doctor a couple times, when I was in the infirmary, but nothing beyond that.

>>Sophomores

>Mochi Uranus HN "Smelly Hero, Stink Rat": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88196664

I like crosswords from the school newspaper. I've spoken once with him when he was writing an article about the club recruitment.

>Kevin Rool: https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88222618

Never seen him. Does he even attend the school?

>Suzuki Nene HN "Ghostly Cat Hero - Bakeneneko": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88707393

Nene-paisen is probably a senpai that interacts with us the most. She's pretty fun to hang out with, though a bit too hands on. I was worried about how Hay would react, but then she did the same thing to her.

>Hiroki Asai HN "Champion of Negativity, Zetsuboy": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88755823

I have no idea who this is.

>>Seniors
>>Class 3-D

>William "Billy" Dustice HN "King Billy": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88192360

Billy-paisen is cool. I spoke with him a couple times in the gym and in Thanks-a-Latte. I asked him to help me get better at basketball, before a rematch with Bobby, but I think I didn't quite go "whoosh" like he said.

>Johanna Hilt HN "The Gauntlet Hero, Weiss Schwarz": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88195437

Johanna-paisen? I tried to talk to her a bit when I heard she's from Germany. She went on a rapid-fire rant in German about the school at me, from which I understood less than a tenth, and just nodded along. She seemed to like having someone to vent to in her native language so I didn't want to break her illusion and say I barely speak it. She still comes to vent to me sometimes. It's a shame we didn't manage to get her that signed calendar of Impakt.

>Mio Katsuragi HN "Forget-Me-Not": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/89250569

Ash's sister and Sandy's girlfriend. She doesn't hang out with us that much except for them. I still wonder how he and Sandy hit it off, exactly, but neither of them really wants to elaborate on it.

>The Rest: https://rentry.org/vx255

The senior class is quite small. I hope our will end up with the same size it started, but the fact we had transfers already worries me a bit. But maybe those that transferred out of the hero course are happy with their decision? Who am I to judge?

### Shiketsu Staff
>>Pro Heroes

>Anzu Nishima HN "Karaburan" (PRINCIPAL): https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88189414

LOVE BAN IS A DUMB RULE! I have no idea why she sticks to that, especially since outside of that she seems to try to do what's best for the school, even if it's just to show up to the UA's principal.

>Aiko Ami HN "Rosethorn, The Motivational Hero" (TEACHER): https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88190438

That was a bit of a rollercoaster. When I heard one of top 10 will be our homeroom teacher, I was pretty hyped. But then she had to throw all that boring stuff at us. But then I guess I got used to it. There is a method to that madness, I think. Even if I'm still not a fan of her class, I think it will help us become better heroes in the future. So, I admit, I'm quite happy she's our homeroom teacher, especially since the kind of mentor a lot of my classmates need.

>Pierre Vachon HN "The Gentle Way Hero: Ippon": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88205924

His class is probably my favourite one. 

>Masanori Kitamura HN "Hijack": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88219956

He teaches Ethics for some other classes, I think, but he does takes over also for ours when Rosethorn is busy.

>Yasashi Koibito HN "The Laser Hero - Majestic": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88231509

He's pretty cool, and his class is fun (Fight Club especially was), but some girls complain about him a bit.

>Junko Hongo HN "The Overly-Enthusiastic Tokusatsu Hero, LocaLoca": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88745486

She tried to recruit me to join the Advanced Rescue Course, but I don't think I want that to be the main focus of my career. And I really would rather postpone learning all those crisis codes, especially that there is a chance they would change by then.

>Omura Tadao HN "Deceptive Hero, Conman": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88754723

Haven't interacted with him outside of his class.

>>Villains

>Karuga Ito: https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88192478

After the exam, Rosethorn arranged a couple sessions with him for me. They helped a bit, but I don't think as much as Hay did.

>Rebecca Weber: https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88722750

The Nurse? She's alright I guess, but without a healing Quirk, she can't really do that much. I'd rather not ask what her actual Quirk is. She gives me candy and cookies sometimes when I come in for a cold pack or something, surprisingly, never the stereotypical lollipops.

>>Supporters

>The Doctor: https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88721597

The Messiah of Shiketsu? The Mr Miracle himself? Of course, I know him. When you train as hard as I do, injuries are unavoidable. Having someone like that in school, really helps us push ourselves to our limits, so I think he's one of if not the most important staff member.

### Pro Heroes

>Kenji Shako HN "The Shrimpy Striker Hero, Magnum Shrimp": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88425908

One of my favourite heroes. I think I still have the poster of him from when he was in that ebi-tempura campaign. He did kick my ass during the exam, but I did get through it in the end. He didn't go full power though, so it just shows how much more I still have to learn.
By the way, we went to the same middle school, though he graduated years before I started. He was quite legendary among the delinquents (so most of the school). I even sat at his old desk, there was his name carved on it.

>--SIDEKICK Chisuke Mizutori HN "The Beautiful Water Fowl Hero, Flamingal": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88425931

Magnum's sidekick? She's pretty cool, btu I think he's cooler.

>Yuusei (優青) Atsushi (富) HN "Spring Dragon Hero, Seiryu": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88194386

Orochi's uncle? Haven't made that much of a name for himself, but he does look pretty cool each time he's on TV.

>--SIDEKICK Kalianne Sato HN "Flame Strike Hero: Honoken": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88568039

As a dragon he really should breathe fire, and since his Quirk doesn't do that, he found a sidekick do that for him. Pretty cool how they complement each other.

>Ryuji Inoue HN "The Transport Hero, Rescue Ray": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88195499

He runs the Youth Centre, right? Pretty nice of him.

>Akagi Sanpatchi HN "Popsy": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88204632

Inigo talks about her a lot, but I don't really know her. When I came to Japan, she was already retired, so I only saw some reruns of her show on TV. I thought she was a normal clown to be honest.

>Bonnie Jovie HN "Birdy": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88225549 (further information at https://pastebin.com/aEK7GFzk)

First time I hear the name.

>Edmund Connor HN "The Tall Man": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88286518

The forest guy? I wonder what he thinks about that fire near Mitsurugi Dojo.

>Ryusei Sugiyama HN "Smokin' Sexy": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88301887 (further information at https://controlc.com/5b505573)

Haven't heard much about him as a hero, but I heard about him from kendo. I've seen him on a couple tournaments I went to with my pops.

>Kevin Thompson HN "The Purple Man": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88357698

Who?

>"Fatso Mann" (DECEASED): https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88311637

Wait, or was that the dude used as a cautionary tale? I can't tell now.

>Yuichi Ishida HN "Slipstream": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88389419

The company he represents had a booth during the tournament. Gave some goodie stuff to the participants. The rashguard I got from them is pretty nice.

>Roland Walker HN "PsyKing": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88616703 (further information at https://pastebin.com/MBrQuv2K)

That's a tragic story.

>Ernst Hennig HN "Impakt": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88616848

Impakt is very cool. "It's not about how hard you hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward." And he can take an impossible beating and then go and pay it back. He's one of the heroes I'd most like to intern under, especially after seeing him in action with my own eyes.

>--SIDEKICK Junpei Ozu HN "The Standstill Hero, Floor": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88820563

He seems pretty cool. Muay Thai is a neat style. As a sidekick he didn't get much media highlight, and I have never spoken to him, so I can't say too much.

>Jack Dunn HN "Three-Sixty": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88931192

A bit too manufactured for my style, and I also like swords more than guns, but maybe Sally would be into this style.

>--COLLEAGUE Keiichi Tantō HN "Racer V": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88926925

I was thinking about taking supplements from his company but they are a bit overpriced.

I like Doctor more.

>Ludolf Raphael Victorius HN "Fair Marshal": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/89006731 (further information at https://rentry.org/9wc67)

I wonder if he's related to Inigo.

>--SIDEKICK Fransk Brunhilde: https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/89014208

I think I might have seen an interview with her once, but I'm not sure…

>Rodion Popo HN "Overman": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/89015229

Can't say I'm familiar.

### Villains
>>Night Parade

>Okane King VN "Midas" (LEADER): https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88190217

Now that's a Villain. It's good that Majestic fought him off, but he didn't manage to capture him, cause he had to focus on rescuing civilians, but he'll get him yet. 

>Cammy Link VN "Karma": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88212761

It's the one that Orochi's cousin chases all the time, right? Hopefully he catches her soon and they can take back what she stole. 

>Haruka Pulch VN "Tatarimokke": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88205909 (further information at https://rentry.org/rwzrqm)

Inigo told me about him. He was Popsy's nemesis, right? I heard he got really pissed off by her antics. A shame she didn't manage to capture him.

>Sebastian Needle (セバスチャン ニードル) VN "Plant Whispering Gangster: Greenfinger" (植物のささやきヤクザ グリーンフィンガー): https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88214481

That's Rosethorn's nemesis, right? I hope she catches him soon.

>"Maw": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88250272

Who? I probably should watch the news more, but I don't really have time to. Maybe I can listen to the radio on my way to school? 

>Ginji Gō VN "Silverado, the Desperado": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88278735

First time I see him //I don't remember if him being Genma's brother was public news, as you can guess, I'm getting tired by now.

>"Bogey the creeping villain": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88277889

The one Majestic took down with Kaylee's assistance? Having a chance to go against an S-Ranker, even if she helped just a bit, will surely be a valuable experience for her.

>"Tomi": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88387913

Who? //bro, I'm tired, I didn't take Villain Trivia, so I don't think Hifumi should really know much about them, and he also hasn't met any of them 

>>Revolutionaries

>Momotaro Tachibana VN "Nebulous Storm": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88376954 (further information at https://controlc.com/9cfc38a8)

Momo? I've met her at Chihiro's. I hope she reconsidered her stance about the Top Heroes. Like, I have respect for those she mentioned too, but she's straight up dismissing the work those at the Top have to do.
Nebulous Storm? Haven't heard of.

>Junichi Takagi VN "Marrow": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88435130 (further information at https://pastebin.com/27Pruk8a)

Junichi? Hay told me about the rude convenience store worker before. I think they might have blown things a bit out of proportion, but I wasn't there, and it's not like they pulled on their influence or anything like that, just filed a complaint. If that was a one-time thing, they probably wouldn't have fired him for that. Hopefully it serves as a motivation to put more effort in his next job.
Marrow? Haven't heard of.

>Kazuma Oomori VN "Charlatan": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88669394 (further information at https://rentry.org/otbq4)

This makes me think, that those white collar types might be someone I would suck at tracking down, but not everyone can do everything.

>>Vigilantes

>Helene Lysingen VN "Noctiluca": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88197005

Helene? The Thanks-A-Latte owner? She's pretty nice, though when I asked for canned coffee, I thought she'll jump over the counter to beat me up.
Noctiluca? Haven't heard of.

>Takigawa Shion VN "Shapeless Blade: Aquarius": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88209069 (further information at https://controlc.com/9427985f)

Shion? I've met her at Chihiro's. She's like a superpowered training robot with that storm blades. I hope one day I'll be on the level where I could beat her.
Aquarius? Haven't heard of.

>>The 5

>Samuel Wilson VN "Desolator": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88917340

Now that's someone even I heard of. He's pretty much a legend. "After all, he did great things - terrible, yes, but great." So many people died because of him. The man is a walking disaster. It's a shame no one managed to take him down until he grew old. It's a real blow to the hero image, that he went unpunished for so long and kept murdering. So, not only did the victims of his crimes suffer, but also there were many other Villains who rose up thinking they can be invincible like he is, and hurt many more.

>On Giết Năng VN "Tether": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88921198

He's one of the newer members of the Five, isn't he? Haven't heard much about him.

>Erika Murakami VN "Nox": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88923183

Ya know how dark humour is used to cope when you're feeling down about something. So, I'll use that. Ya remember the meme about Brazil being Champions of the World in murder rates? This is a bit how I feel seeing a Japanese in the Five.

>Edmund Muller VN "Mercury": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88923191

Can't say I have much to say about him other than him being a member of the five.

>Maddie Griffiths VN "Mad Oxe"/"Maddox": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88930575

She's currently like the number two in the Five, right? I hope they capture her soon and poot an end to their crime streak.

>Hiromi Hitomi VN "Apex Predator Villain: Feral": https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88856089

She's the one Orochi fought last time, right? Damn, she looks tough. Good on Orochi for holding her off as long as she did.

Seen the way Impakt took him down. The dude really seems not right in the head. I hope they capture him so he can get some proper help.

>Miriam Slowburn Hakase VN "Prolonging Evil: Big Hat" (NPC): https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88736960

I've seen her on some "Most Wanted" list but nothing beyond that.

I've been to her circus once on a school trip when I was like 8. Was pretty fun. Nowadays I'd probably be more into the arena side of things, but the tickets are expensive.

>Rika Eichi: https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88209395

When Hay bought me a new sword, it was from her. As in the sheathing mechanism. The base sword was made by someone else.  Do you think she';; be mad when she hears what Magnum did to it?

She's the new nurse, right? When Doctor isn't around, she's a pretty good substitute.
