###Questions

#####*The fuck is this?*
A board-wide fanfiction writing contest hosted by /wg/. We're hoping to bring in new writers from across /vt/, so don't be afraid to join in even if you've never written anything before.

#####*What are the rules?*
1. Stories must have a minimum of 500 words. There is no maximum word limit, but keep in mind that it's unlikely many voters would be willing to read a whole novel.
2. Your story must star a vTuber in some way or form. Fans, cosplayers, roleplayers, etc. do not count as vTubers. As long as they are a vTuber, you can have them do whatever and act however you like. The chuuba also does not have to be the main character in the story (obviously just don't write a fic full of OCs then only mention them in one sentence).
3. The submission period for stories is one month, starting on **07/25** and ending on **08/25 (23:59 UTC-12 time)**. You can submit a story at any time during this period, and all stories that have been submitted will be available to view in this archive. An additional week will be given after the end date for voters to read some stories and decide on their favourite **(08/26 - 09/01)**. The voting period will last three days **(09/02 - 09/04)** and will be completed via Google Forms.
4. The contest has two main categories: SFW and NSFW. There will be separate polls for both categories, meaning there will be two winning stories at the end of the contest -- one for the SFW category and one the NSFW category.
5. If a story already exists within the main archive, it will not qualify for the contest.

#####*How do I submit my story?*
You should see a */VT/ WRITING RUMBLE STORY ANCHOR* at/near the top of the thread, which you can reply to with a link to your story. Make sure to properly tag your stories, especially to indicate if it is SFW or NSFW as this will determine which category you are entering into. Popular websites for hosting fics include **Google Docs with its publish function** and **Rentry**. More details about tagging and hosting stories can be found in our main archive at https://rentry.co/VTCFFCD.

#####*Can I submit multiple stories?*
If you have the drive to write more than one, please be our guest.

#####*Is there a central theme?*
Not for this contest, no. We're giving the writers complete freedom since we're trying to cast a wide net. You can write about whatever you like, but if it has smut it will be considered a NSFW entry. We may host a second contest that has a theme in the future if all goes well. With that said, we've provided some optional themes further down if you need inspiration or some direction for your story.

#####*Who can vote?*
Anyone can, but if you plan on voting for a category winner, try to read at least a few stories in that category before deciding.

#####*Is this chuuba allowed?*
As long as they are a vTuber, yes.

#####*Do I get a prize?*
Bragging rights? You might get your story translated by the Koreans, too.

###Some pointers for new writers
If you need help with getting started on a story or happen to be void of any ideas, read on.

#####*Tips for getting started*
- We recommend reading some published stories or even fics from our main archive to get an idea of formatting and the type of prose you want to write with, as well as some possible inspiration. Take notes of what you like and what you donâ€™t to craft your own style.
- Try reading your sentences and dialogue out loud to see how they roll off the tongue. Keep a thesaurus handy as well to mix up your vocabulary.
- If youâ€™re short on ideas, start by imagining a scene you want to see played out with a chuuba and building your story around it. What's the setting? How do you get your characters to that scene? What happens after it?
- Ask the thread. We can recommend stories that did particular aspects well, or bounce ideas off of each other and generally assist you in crafting a story.
- The best way to improve is to just start writing and receive some feedback. Donâ€™t be afraid to throw your hat in the ring, we all had to start somewhere. Who knows, you might be better than you think, and good enough to take a shot at the title of champion.

#####*Optional themes & ideas*
Here are some themes you can choose to align your stories with if you feel the need to follow a central concept. These are entirely optional and do not have to be present in your story if you've already got something cooking.
- Dream
- Embers
- Binding
- Seasons
- Ephemeral

Or if you want something a little more straightforward, here are some open ideas you can use as the basis for your story.

- What lies beyond the stars
- The mysterious bottle of pills
- Anon! It's a *mall katana!*
- The worst day of (You)r life
- A first and final breath of freedom

#####*/wg/'s prompt archive*
If you're still short on ideas for your story, you can check out our prompt archive and see if anything catches your eye (keep in mind a lot of it is quite old).
