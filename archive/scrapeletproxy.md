###### an experiment

!!! info info
    I will fill with one or two scrapelet keys (long overdue to change this...)
    Key (at least one T5)/source (with at least one T5 that you/I can find) donators get unlimited quota.
    Everyone else gets a decent quota. I intend to keep this proxy open, and have very little requirements other than sending me an email.
    The proxy will be entirely funded by donations.

!!! note news
     OpenAI key status: bad; AWS key status: good. Why would you token share? What's the point?
    **cooders.veryscrappy.moe - Filtered Azure GPT (thanks anon!) *with no quota limit, tool usage enabled*. If the password gets leaked or spited, I'm killing it immediately.**
    Answered emails. Based chinks.
    **I won't reply to tech support emails. If you want more IPs, include your token and explanation in the email, and don't ask before you hit the limit.**

!!! info faq
    I don't host on Render, I selfhost.
    Quotas are reduced since I don't have many keys.
    I do not trip.
