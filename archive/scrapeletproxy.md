>It was a mistake.

Why?
* !~Mostly~!, I don't know how to scrape.
* I didn't expect it to last this long.
* Not sure why people are taking this as my main point, but (many) locusts suck.

So here's what's happening:
* The main proxy, veryscrappy.moe, will be shut down and replaced with a static page.
* [Cooders](https://cooders.veryscrappy.moe) (Filtered Azure GPT, no quota, tools enabled) will remain up.
* [Desu redirect](https://desu.veryscrappy.moe) will remain up.
* I'll have the server until April, and the domain until next January.
* If you want to use the domain or server for proxy-related things in that timeframe, send me an email.
* I will not answer any emails asking for user tokens, but I will answer other emails.
 (Update: I also won't answer emails asking why you got banned.)
* I might restart the proxy if I get a consistent source of keys that can handle this many users.
* I will try to upstream my changes to the proxy code.

So long and thanks for all the hate.
