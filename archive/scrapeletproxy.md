###### an experiment

!!! info info
    I will fill with one or two scrapelet keys (long overdue to change this...)
    Key (at least one T5)/source (with at least one T5 that you/I can find) donators get unlimited quota.
    Everyone else gets a decent quota. I intend to keep this proxy open, and have very little requirements other than sending me an email.
    The proxy will be entirely funded by donations.
    cooders.veryscrappy.moe - Filtered Azure GPT (thanks anon!) *with no quota limit, tool usage enabled*. If the password gets leaked or spited, I'm killing it immediately.
    I won't reply to tech support emails. If you want more IPs, include your token and explanation in the email, and don't ask before you hit the limit.

!!! note news
    #### out of openai keys
    ###### for coding stuff, try cooders
    Want to teach me how to scrape or donate keys? Send an email.
    Answered emails.
    Added dark mode.

!!! info faq
    If I have 10+ keys for 2-3 days, I'll increase quotas.
    I don't host on Render, I selfhost.
    I do not trip.
