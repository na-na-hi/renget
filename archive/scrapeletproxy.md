###### an experiment

!!! info info
    I will fill with one or two scrapelet keys.
    Key/source donators get unlimited quota.
    Everyone else gets a decent quota. I intend to keep this proxy open, and have very little requirements other than sending me an email.
    The proxy will be entirely funded by donations.
    The proxy will mostly use donated keys. ~~been filling with my own keys recently~~

!!! note news
    cooders.veryscrappy.moe - Filtered Azure GPT (thanks anon!). If the password gets leaked or spited, I'm killing it immediately.
    Removed Mistral, not worth the effort. **I won't reply to tech support emails. If you want more IPs, include your token in the email, and don't ask before you hit the limit.**
    Refilled keys. Answered emails. Updated proxy ([e7318dc2](https://gitgud.io/veryscrappy/oai-reverse-proxy/-/commits/e7318dc27aaf564b407bfdc0fbabd5268bfce49c)).

!!! info faq
    I don't host on Render, I selfhost.
    Quotas are reduced since I don't have many keys.
    I do not trip.
