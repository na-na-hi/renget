###### an experiment

!!! info info
    I will fill with one or two scrapelet keys.
    Key/source donators get unlimited quota.
    Everyone else gets a decent quota. I intend to keep this proxy open, and have very little requirements other than sending me an email.
    The proxy will be entirely funded by donations.
    The proxy will mostly use donated keys. ~~been filling with my own keys recently~~

!!! note news (12/2/2024)
    ~20 emails that I'll answer later. +2 keys. I don't trip, check this rentry.
    FAQ: I don't host on Render, I selfhost. Also yes I'm a scrapelet if it wasn't obvious by the name of the rentry.
    Thank you key and source donators!
    It's probably going to be over in a few weeks. (I can't scrape well enough to feed this many people)
    Reduced quotas, hardly any keys.
    I would be very grateful to any key/source donators. Thanks to everyone who's donated!
