###### an experiment

!!! info info
    I will fill with one or two scrapelet keys.
    Key/source donators get unlimited quota.
    Everyone else gets a decent quota. I intend to keep this proxy open, and have very little requirements other than sending me an email.
    The proxy will be entirely funded by donations.
    The proxy will mostly use donated keys.

!!! note news
    Refilled with my keys. I can't scrape well enough to feed this many people, so it'll die sooner or later. (Also why I was pushing for key donations.)
    https://desu.veryscrappy.moe redirects to latest desuproxy, try it out
    Reduced quotas, hardly any keys.
    *Not opposed to running a cloudy if donated keys.*
    Removed donation addresses. Out of keys anyways, so no point.
    I would be very grateful to any key/source donators. Thanks to everyone who's donated!
