###### an experiment

!!! info info
    I will fill with one or two scrapelet keys (long overdue to change this...)
    Key (at least one T5)/source (with at least one T5 that you/I can find) donators get unlimited quota.
    Everyone else gets a decent quota. I intend to keep this proxy open, and have very little requirements other than sending me an email.
    The proxy will be entirely funded by donations.
    cooders.veryscrappy.moe - Filtered Azure GPT (thanks anon!) *with no quota limit, tool usage enabled*
    I won't reply to tech support emails. If you want more IPs, include your token and explanation in the email, and don't ask before you hit the limit.

!!! note news
    Proxy will be back up in a few hours.
    >50 emails only asking for tokens, nothing else
    ~~Still out of keys.~~ ?
    Haven't answered emails. Not sure if this is sustainable, at least with my scraping skills and lack of donations.
    Added dark mode.

!!! info faq
    If I have 10+ keys for 2-3 days, I'll increase quotas.
    I don't host on Render, I selfhost.
    I do not trip.
