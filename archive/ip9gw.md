#A long distance spent apart

It was summer break at college and Sunny had received a call from Mari saying she wanted him to visit her and Hero.
He was currently waiting by the sidewalk with his stuff, a large group of people around him. Seemingly by chance, someone he knew bumped into him. They weren't best friends, but friends enough to hang out and talk with each other. Well, he mostly did the talking. Sunny still wasn't a big fan of speaking too much. Although he still chatted with him about small things.
In the middle of their conversation, Sunny heard the honking of a car and looked up. He saw it roll down a window to reveal Mari wearing sunglasses.
She took off her sunglasses once she saw him and called out "Heeeeeey, Sunny!"
"Yo, Sun, that's your sis?" He felt an arm set down on his shoulder.
Sunny raised his eyes to the sky, embarrassed by how many people could see them right now. Mari hadn't really changed, had she?
She got out of the car and approached them. "It's great to see you again, Sunshine!"
Sunny winced as he heard his friend suppress a laugh. "Sunshine? That's certainly a word that describes you."
He hoped more than anything for them to just get in the car and leave, but it seems Mari had other plans...

..

Seems Mari wanted to make a huge dinner today for him and Hero, so they went grocery shopping. And she wanted to do it here in order to save time. He felt that this was an excuse for them to go out on walk and catch up with each other, which would have been fine.
Fine if Mari wasn't clinging to his shoulders and fawning over him in front of absolutely everyone.
"I'm so lucky to have a super cute little brother like you!" Mari exclaimed happily while patting his head.
"Mari...not in front of everyone..." Sunny whined as he buried his face deeper into his hoodie.
She always had to be like this, whenever they met up. Hero never acted like this around Kel...
It was awkward having to walk like this, Mari holding on to his shoulder and being more clingy than they should be at this age.
They were both adults, it was embarrassing for her to still be doing this kind of stuff with him...
"I'm not a kid anymore..." Sunny mumbled in his hood, Mari barely hearing what he said.
"I know. You used to be such a small young boy, but now you've grown into such a handsome young man!" Mari emphasized this by wrapping him up in a hug, causing Sunny to seize up like he'd been petrified. He dearly hoped there was nobody here that would recognize him later...
Mari certainly didn't let up reminiscing on the old days after that, and never let go of him until they reached the grocery store.

Thankfully Mari wasn't as clingy once they reached the store, mostly because they both had to carry groceries. Mari purchased small things, but he also noticed her purchasing his favorite kind of steak, which certainly made him feel happy.
The walk back to the car was less of a hassle this time, and more filled with mostly one-sided conversation. It was nice getting to catch up with what Mari and Hero have been doing, not having heard much from them. What he was most interested in hearing was Mari talking about her teaching job.
"I've always loved playing the piano, and the children have been really happy to learn. I don't know if I'm perfect at it, but It's been lots of fun teaching, and they look so happy when I play the piano for them. Some of the kids really remind me of you sometimes. Back when you first picked up the violin, and that look you had playing your very first notes...oh! Sunny, do you still play your violin?"
No, not really. He's barely touched it since then. Too many memories.
"A little." Sunny lied, not wanting to disappoint her.
Mari beamed at him after hearing that. "Hehe, that's nice to hear. Maybe you could come in sometimes and we could play a song for the kids? It'd make them so happy, and I'd love to play with you again, like we used to."
He didn't really like playing the violin anymore.
It's been so many years since then, but he still couldn't forget about the recital.
"No." Sunny said a bit more coldly than he intended, looking away.
"O-oh...okay." Mari seemed a bit taken aback and her smile faded.
Sunny couldn't look at her after that, and they walked in relative silence.
And once they reached the car, Sunny fell asleep much to quickly for any conversation to start.

...

...

"We're home." Mari said as she shook him lightly.
After getting back, Mari decided to put away the groceries so Sunny could sleep longer.
"Mmhmm." He mumbled as he slowly woke up, and unbuckled himself. Mari considered carrying him in, but...
She led him into his room, a guest room that was surprisingly cold.
Sunny sat down on the bed and started unpacking his things.
Mari noticed that he had brought the violin with him.
...
Looking back, Mari realized how cold Sunny had been with her all day. How he seemed to shy away from her, and didn't seem very happy to see her again. He was with a new friend he seemed happy with, up to the point he saw her. She was having fun this whole time teasing him, happy to see him again after all this time, but maybe...maybe he hadn't felt the same...
...
"Sunny, I'm...sorry. I wanted to spend some time with you, but you probably wanted to do something else with your break..."
Mari kept her eyes towards the ground, not wanting to see his face right now.
"It's not often I get to hear from you, and you never really call...even our friends say that they rarely hear from you, it's starting to feel like you're slipping away...I just don't want to lose you...If..."
Mari took a deep breath, and let it out.
"If you want...I can drive you back home so you can-"
Before she could finish speaking, Sunny threw himself against her in a hug, nearly toppling her over.
She was stunned for a moment, before slowly wrapping her arms around him.
"I missed you too..." She heard him sniffle into her shoulder.
