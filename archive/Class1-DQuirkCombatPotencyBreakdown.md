# Class 1-D Quirk Combat Potency Breakdown
!!!note ***Note:***
    For the purposes of this analysis, "Combat Potency" will be a measure of invested points in direct combat applications + stated and implied perquisites/supplements of their use, minus drawbacks. The exception to this will be "Extra" combat applications for otherwise noncombat quirks. In such cases, only stated prerequisites will be counted.

!!!note ***Note:***
  	 In cases where a quirk has multiple direct combat applications, two methods will be used for calculating Combat Potency in individual combat areas: the *"Subtraction Method,"* and the *"Fractional Method" :*

	*Subtraction Method:* Costs of unrelated direct combat options are subtracted from the Total Combat-Related Point Investment to measure each individual Combat Potency score, with the prerequisite/supplementary options remaining each time.

	*Fractional Method:* The costs of all direct combat applications are totaled. The potency of each combat application is calculated as a fraction of the Total Combat-Related Point Investment in the same ratio as the totaled direct combat applications.




!!!note ***Note:*** 
	Characters with multiple quirks probably deserve some sort of debuff to account for the added physical strain of using them simultaneously. Unfortunately, that's not something I can easily quantity here, so I'll simply be analyzing their quirks separately. Anons are free to make their own judgements based on the breakdown.

##Chihiro Mitsurugi: Yako
Quirk Combat Applications: **Movement Buff (Speed), Stamina Debuff**
Total Combat-Related Point Investment: **21**

Combat Potency Via Subtraction Method #1 for Speed Buff: **19**
Combat Potency Via Subtraction Method #2 for Speed Buff: **17.5**
Combat Potency Via Fractional Method #1 for Speed Buff: **15**
Combat Potency Via Fractional Method #2 for Speed Buff: **10.5**

Combat Potency Via Subtraction Method #1 for Stamina Debuff: **16**
Combat Potency Via Subtraction Method #2 for Stamina Debuff: **17.5**
Combat Potency Via Fractional Method #1 for Stamina Debuff: **5.99**
Combat Potency Via Fractional Method #2 for Stamina Debuff: **10.5**

!!!note ***Note:*** 
	To account for Yako's quirk using Quirk Refinement to expand the scope of the Energy Target for debuffing, I did two versions of each method. In the First, I used the cost of her quirk refinement to represent the hypothetical cost of the stamina debuff. In the second version, I added the costs of her speed enhancement and quirk refinement and divided the total (5 cost speed enhancement became a 3.5 cost, and the stamina debuff became a hypothetical 3.5 cost). I went with the latter option when ranking her speed, as current discussion/writefaggotry leads me to believe both aspects of the quirk are equally potent. If her anon takes issue with this, I am open to feedback.

##Soujyuuro Imai: Mahoudeva
Quirk Combat Applications: **Mental Debuff (Suggestion)**
Total Combat-Related Point Investment and Combat Potency for Suggestion: **9**


##Bobby Samson: Sunlight Man
Quirk Combat Applications: **Damage Buff (Strength), Defense Buff (Durability)**
Total Combat-Related Point Investment:  **26** (4 true xp)

Combat Potency Via Subtraction Method for Strength Buff: **21**
Combat Potency Via Fractional Method for Strength Buff: **13**

Combat Potency Via Subtraction Method for Durability Buff: **21**
Combat Potency Via Fractional Method for Durability Buff: **13**

##Sora Tanaka: Orbit
Quirk Combat Applications: **Movement Buff (Speed), Movement Debuff (Speed), Defense Buff (Damage Prevention)**
Total Combat-Related Point Investment:  **22** (1 true xp)

Combat Potency Via Subtraction Method for Speed Buff: **14**
Combat Potency Via Fractional Method for Speed Buff: **7.33**

Combat Potency Via Subtraction Method for Speed Debuff: **14**
Combat Potency Via Fractional Method for Speed Debuff: **7.33**

Combat Potency Via Subtraction Method for Damage Prevention: **14**
Combat Potency Via Fractional Method for Damage Prevention: **7.33**

!!!note ***Note:*** 
	The multipurpose nature of Orbit's quirk and the structure of the Gravity Manipulation Template makes calculating his quirk's direct combat applications tricky. Upon reviewing current discussion/writefaggotry and the initial build, I worked under the assumption that battlefield control and movement buffing/debuffing were Orbit anon's primary goals. I then chose the most direct paths from his purchases to fulfill those applications when doing the calculations (i.e. direction + intensity for increasing movement speed). Considering this and the fact that available methods for secondary applications tended to be more "indirect" with his medium potency, potential secondary combat applications, such as damage, were not calculated.

	 There are other methods for achieving similar results for each combat application I did list, but narrowing it down to the most direct ones appeared to produce the most comparable results to the less "tricky" quirks. If Orbit anon takes issue with my method, I'm open to feedback.

##Kaylee Suzuki: Flying Force
Quirk #1 Combat Applications: **Movement Buff (Flight/Speed), Damage Buff (Blast)**
Total Combat-Related Point Investment:  **11** (1 true xp)

Combat Potency Via Subtraction Method for Flight/Speed Buff: **8.5**
Combat Potency Via Fractional Method for Flight/Speed Buff: **5.5**

Combat Potency Via Subtraction Method for Blast: **8.5**
Combat Potency Via Fractional Method for Blast: **5.5**

!!!note ***Note:*** 
	There's not a lot of explanation for the flying portion of this quirk in the build post. My assumption is that the blasting goal and movement goal hold equal weight. Because these applications come from the same quirk options, I simply split the total cost of said options into two equal parts to calculate both combat applications. If Kaylee anon intended for one of these applications to be secondary to the other, I'm open to feedback.

Quirk #2 Combat Applications: **Defense Buff (Health), Damage Buff (Strength)**
Total Combat-Related Point Investment:  **17**

Combat Potency Via Subtraction Method for Strength Buff: **13**
Combat Potency Via Fractional Method for Strength Buff: **9.44**

Combat Potency Via Subtraction Method for Health Buff: **12**
Combat Potency Via Fractional Method for Heath Buff: **7.56**


!!!note ***Note:***  
	Because the Quirk Refinement seemed to affect Kaylee in her entirety, I split the point cost between both quirks for the purposes of calculating their Total Combat-Related Point Investments. 


##Shinkan Sen: Crazy Train
Quirk Combat Applications: **Defense Buff (Health), Movement Buff (Speed), Damage Buff (Strength), Damage Buff (Blast)**
Total Combat-Related Point Investment:  **21**

Combat Potency Via Subtraction Method for Health Buff: **8**
Combat Potency Via Fractional Method for Health Buff: **8**

Combat Potency Via Subtraction Method for Speed Buff: **4**
Combat Potency Via Fractional Method for Speed Buff: **4**

Combat Potency Via Subtraction Method for Strength Buff: **5**
Combat Potency Via Fractional Method for Strength Buff: **5**

Combat Potency Via Subtraction Method for Blast: **4**
Combat Potency Via Fractional Method for Blast: **4**

!!!note ***Note:*** 
	As Shinkan anon described the heat and steam generated from his Quirk Refinement as a "secondary attack," I decided to count it as a separate Blast application. If his anon would prefer I apply it to something like Strength or Speed, I'm open to feedback.

!!!note ***Note:*** 
	Shinkan anon actually left one quirk point unspent, so I added it to his Total Combat-Related Point Investment. Not doing so would have caused his drawbacks to overly penalize him with both methods used for calculating Combat Potency. Anyone who takes issue with me doing this for him will be ignored.

##Hifumi Takeda: Challenger

Combat Potency Via Fractional Method for Psychokinetic Damage: **11.5**

Combat Potency Via Fractional Method for Damage Prevention: **11.5**

!!!note ***Note:*** 
	As there weren't adequate options for the Subtraction Method, only the Fractional Method was used. This will be the case for a number of characters going forward.

Combat Potency Via Fractional Method for Kinetic Damage: **7**

Combat Potency Via Fractional Method for Damage Negation: **7**

Combat Potency Via Fractional Method for Flight/Speed Buff: **7**


## Christopher Cain: Mirror Devil
!!!note ***Note:*** 
	There's really no way to analyze this guy. His combat applications and potency are determined by whatever quirks he has at the time.

## Son Jugo: Aspara
Quirk #1 Combat Applications: **Movement Buff (Flight/Speed), Damage Buff (Blast)**
Total Combat-Related Point Investment:  **17** (2 true xp)

Combat Potency Via Subtraction Method for Flight/Speed Buff: **13**
Combat Potency Via Fractional Method for Flight/Speed Buff: **5.7**

Combat Potency Via Subtraction Method for Blast: **15**
Combat Potency Via Fractional Method for Blast: **11.3**

!!!note ***Note:*** 
	I did the calculations for Quirk #1 under the assumption that the Fluid option was chosen for his wind-induced movement buff, and the Plasma option was chosen for his Ki Blasts.

Quirk #2 Combat Applications: **Damage Buff (Strength), Movement Buff (Reflexes)**
Total Combat-Related Point Investment:  **13**

Combat Potency Via Subtraction Method for Strength Buff: **8**
Combat Potency Via Fractional Method for Strength Buff: **6.5**

Combat Potency Via Subtraction Method for Reflexes Buff: **8**
Combat Potency Via Fractional Method for Reflexes Buff: **6.5**

## Genma Go: Goldorado
Quirk Combat Applications: **Movement Buff (Speed), Movement Debuff (General)**
Total Combat-Related Point Investment:  **6.5**

Combat Potency Via Fractional Method for Speed Buff:  **3.25**

Combat Potency Via Fractional Method for General Movement Debuff: **3.25**

!!!note ***Note:***
	 I'm sure there's some sort of combat application for his replication quirk, but it seems to fall into the same category as Christopher's, with the applications and potency being dependent on whatever he copies. For this reason, I won't be analyzing his second quirk.

## Ashleigh Katsuragi: Blackout
Quirk Combat Applications: **Mental Debuff (Memory Impairment)**
Total Combat-Related Point Investment:  **15**

Combat Potency for Memory Impairment: **15**

!!!note ***Note:***
	 Her anon appears to have points left unspent, however, this also seems intention. For this reason, I'm leaving the point investment as is.

## Atsushi Orochi: Yamata
Quirk Combat Applications: **Damage Buff (Strength), Defense Buff (Durability), Defense Buff (Regeneration), Damage Buff (Innate Weapon #1) Damage Buff (Innate Weapon #2), Movement Debuff (Speed #1), Movement Debuff (Speed #2)**
Total Combat-Related Point Investment:  **21**

Combat Potency Via Fractional Method for Damage Buff (Strength): **2.34**

Combat Potency Via Fractional Method for Defense Buff (Durability): **4.65**

Combat Potency Via Fractional Method for Defense Buff (Regeneration): **4.65**

Combat Potency Via Fractional Method for Damage Buff (Innate Weapon #1): **2.34**

Combat Potency Via Fractional Method for Damage Buff (Innate Weapon #2): **2.34**

Combat Potency Via Fractional Method for Movement Debuff (Speed #1): **2.34**

Combat Potency Via Fractional Method for Movement Debuff (Speed #2): **2.34**

!!!note ***Note:*** 
	Orochi Anon designated several uses for this quirk, so determining the desired ratios was somewhat difficult. Comparing the amount of fluff and considering she's the "Hard to Destroy Lizard Hero," I opted to weigh the durability and regen applications twice as much as the others. If Orochi anon takes issue with this, I'm open to feedback.

##  Nyoro Hoge: Maru

!!!note ***Note:*** 
	Maru's anon didn't list all her options, so I'm just going to give her a Combat Potency of 21 in Stealth.

## Yui Sagara: Capture Cloth
Quirk Combat Applications: **Movement Debuff (Speed), Damage Buff (Innate Weapon), Movement Buff ( Innate Weapon Speed)**
Total Combat-Related Point Investment:  **21**

Combat Potency Via Subtraction Method for Speed Debuff: **11.16**
Combat Potency Via Fractional Method for Speed Debuff: **7**

Combat Potency Via Subtraction Method for Natural Weapon: **11.16**
Combat Potency Via Fractional Method for Natural Weapon: **7**

Combat Potency Via Subtraction Method for Speed Buff: **11.16**
Combat Potency Via Fractional Method for Speed Buff:  **7**

## Kyoda Hiro: Overdose
Quirk Combat Applications: **Damage Buff (Strength), Movement Buff (Speed), Defense Buff (Regeneration) Mental Buff (Performance)**
Total Combat-Related Point Investment:  **26**

Combat Potency Via Fractional Method for Strength Buff **6.5**

Combat Potency Via Fractional Method for Speed Buff: **6.5**

Combat Potency Via Fractional Method for Defense Buff: **6.5**

Combat Potency Via Fractional Method for Mental Performance Buff: **6.5**

!!!note ***Note*** 
	Hiro's quirks simply didn't work on their own like with other multi-quirk builds, so it was necessary to treat them as a single quirk to complete the analysis. 

## Sandatsu Owari
Quirk #1 Combat Applications: **Defense Buff (Health), Damage Buff (Strength)**
Total Combat-Related Point Investment:  **25**

Combat Potency Via Fractional Method for Health Buff: **17**

Combat Potency Via Fractional Method for Strength Buff: **8**

Quirk #2 Combat Applications: **Damage Buff (Natural Weapon), Defense Buff (Natural Weapon)**
Total Combat-Related Point Investment:  **15**

Combat Potency Via Fractional Method for Innate Weapon Damage: **7.5**

Combat Potency Via Fractional Method for Innate Weapon Defense: **7.5**

Quirk #3 Combat Applications: **Mental Debuff (Possession)**
Total Combat-Related Point Investment:  **27**
Combat Potency For Possession: **27**

!!!note ***Note***  
	I opted to leave out his base quirk, since its activation is so situational. I made some extra assumptions for the ratios of his reaped quirks, so if Sandatsu anon takes issue with the ones used, I'm open to suggestions.


#Speed Rankings
!!!note ***Note*** 
	For those whose quirk templates didn't allow for the Subtraction Method, their scores via the Fractional Method will be used for both rankings. Likewise, Those students whose quirk had a single combat focus will also have their score used for both.

	#**Bonus Round**
!!!note Note:
	Since hero students get half as many XP points as they get QP, I thought it'd be interesting to calculate the Total Combat-Related Point Investment with the XP values doubled for those who drew from their XP pool instead of converting their QP. That isn't to say XP should necessarily be viewed as worth double QP. This is just for fun.
	
	Didn't end up changing the placements much, but it I'll list them anyways.
