### Recommendations for legacy system players

Here are the coarse recommendations. Scroll further for details and reasoning.
- Hold Time Swirl Pass.
    - Unless you are farming at least 1 piece of both Ana and Dirac and have insufficient total pieces of Ana TMB and Dirac TMB, in which case you should continue to buy SS Event Bounties. See details.
- Hold all Ghosts of doubtful usefulness.
- Safe to hold all Shades.
- Safe to hold all Spirits.
- Safe to forge desired equipment that you already have all mats for, but avoid buying fuel using Bounty Silver or salvaging Ghosts.
- Spend all Bounty Silver on G2 Stigma Ghosts, if you are farming any G2 Stigma. (If you are not farming G2 Stigma and have Bounty Silver, see details below.)
- The below recommendation was prior to an [update](https://bbs.mihoyo.com/bh3/article/5639706) from Mihoyo.
- ~~Use all Shades in equipment forging~~
    - ~~Buy Fuel using Bounty Silver, if necessary, after having bought all of the Ghosts you need.~~
- ~~Use all G1 Stigma Spirits.~~
    - ~~Other Spirits, do as you like.~~
    - ~~Buy Fuel using Bounty Silver, if necessary, after having bought all of the Ghosts you need.~~


##### Spending forging materials

Mihoyo gives the following conversion for Ghosts to Quartz. This is roughly fair for Stigmata. You can verify that this is fair using table in this guide.
- 1 G3 Ghost => 4 G3 Quartz (of correct type)
- 1 G2 Ghost => 5 G2 Quartz (of correct type)
- 1 G1 Ghost => 8 G1 Quartz (of correct type)

Importantly, because this conversion is fair, **if you have Ghost of a Stigma you do not need to forge, but after the update it can be used to forge a Stigma that you do want, hold it**! For example, if you want to forge Planck M but are missing its Ghosts, hold all Planck Ghosts. In fact, **it is always safe to hold Ghosts, so when in doubt just hold**.

Fenghuang Pinions is the only G2 Weapon at the time of writing. Its Ghosts will follow the same conversion policy as that of G2 Stigmata, which is fair. 50 Pinions Ghosts, the required amount in the legacy system, will be converted to 250 G2 Quartz, the required amount in the new system. I recommend all players eventually make Fenghuang Pinions. However, under the new system, players without Fenghuang Down may leave their Pinions Ghosts to convert into G2 Quartz useful for making desired Stigmata, and then farm G2 Quartz later to make Fenghuang Pinions when Fenghuang Down is obtained.

Mihoyo gives this conversion for Shades (blue-colored). ~~This is not a good rate. 60 Fuel is the amount of Fuel obtained from salvaging a G1 Shade into Fuel. Thus, **I would recommend consuming all of the Shades you currently own in forging equipment before the update**.~~ In a [later update](https://bbs.mihoyo.com/bh3/article/5639706), Mihoyo changed the conversation for G1 Shades. The rate for G1 Shades is now fair. **It is safe to hold G1 Shades.**
- ~~1 G1 Shade => 60 Fuel~~
- 1 G1 Shade => 50 Fuel + 48 G1 Quartz

Mihoyo gives this conversion for Spirits (purple-colored). The rate for G2 Stigma Spirits is fair. ~~The rate for G1 Stigma Spirits is not fair. Thus, **I would recommend forging the G1 Stigma of all of your G1 Stigma Spirits before the update**.~~ In a [later update](https://bbs.mihoyo.com/bh3/article/5639706), Mihoyo changed the conversation for G1 Stigma Spirits. The rate for G1 Stigma Spirits is now fair. **It is safe to hold G1 and G2 Stigma Spirits.**
- 1 G2 Stigma Spirit => 200 G2 Quartz (of correct type) + 500 Fuel
- ~~1 G1 Stigma Spirit => 270 Fuel~~
- 1 G1 Stigma Spirit => 400 Fuel + 192 G1 Quartz + 80 Honkai Pieces
- G1 Weapon Spirits will stay as they are

Mihoyo's conversion for Bounty Silver is based on its Fuel purchasing power. Buying Fuel with Bounty Silver is the worst use of Bounty Silver (worse than buying Ghosts and Lens). In the legacy system, it is far better to use Bounty Silver to purchase useful G2 Ghosts, followed by useful G3 Ghosts, followed by Purple Lens. Thus, **I would recommend spending all Bounty Silver before the update on Ghosts**. Because the purchasing price of G3 Ghosts using Bounty Silver is 
- 20 Bounty Silver => 1 Fuel

The conversion for Shade Shard is also based on its Fuel purchasing power. Again, this is the worst use of this this resource. Thus, **I would recommend spending all Shade Shards before the update on G1 Stigma Shades that you find useful**. 30 Shade Shards buy 1 G1 Stigma Shade. If you do not have at least 30 Shade Shards, then just leaving them to convert is fine.
- 1 Shade Shard => 6 Fuel


##### Farming and spending Time Swirl Pass

**If you are looking to farm at least one piece of Ana and at least one piece of Dirac, then I recommend spending Time Swirl Pass on SS Event Bounties until you have enough total pieces of Ana TMB and Dirac TMB. Otherwise, I recommend holding your Time Swirl Pass.**

By "total pieces", I mean that if you need only Ana M, then you need to farm until you have 35 pieces of Ana T, M, or B. If you need Ana T and Ana B, then you need to farm until you have 70 pieces of Ana T, M, or B.

Upon updating to v4.8, all Ghosts of Ana TMB will be converted into Ice Quartz; there will be no distinction between the T, M, and B Ghosts. Moreover, 35 Ghosts will be converted into enough Quartz to forge one piece of Ana.

The payoff of legacy SS Event Bounty is better so long as all Ghosts dropped are useful to you. (Actually, the same goes for S Event Bounty, but I think it is far less likely that all Ghosts dropped are useful to you.)

In the new system, this is the payoff for Time Swirl Pass.
- 100 Time Swirl Pass => 40 Fuel + 9 G3 Quartz (redemption via floor 6)
- 100 Time Swirl Pass => 40 Fuel + 12.5 G2 Quartz (redemption via floor 4)
- (Floor 5 has a very slightly better payoff, but for simplicity and the purposes of this recommendation, we can ignore it for now.)

(We can also assume that you always spend Time Swirl Pass to redeem the floor prizes on desirable floors.)

In the legacy system, this is the payoff for Time Swirl Pass.
- 100 Time Swirl Pass => 22.22 Fuel + 2.5 G3 Ghosts at random + 0.93 G3 Ghosts of choice (SS-rank Event Bounty)
- 100 Time Swirl Pass => 20 Fuel + 1.5 G2 Ghosts at random + 4 G1 Ghosts at random + 1.2 G2 Ghosts of choice (A-rank Event Bounty)

1 useful G3 Ghost converts to 4 G3 Quartz.

If you are looking to forge at least one piece of Ana and at least one piece of Dirac and have insufficient Ghosts, all 2.5 at random G3 Ghosts are valuable, so 100 Time Swirl Pass buys 13.70 G3 Quartz, worth much more than the 9 G3 Quartz in the new system (and each Ghost is worth at least 15 Fuel, so the fuel discrepancy is more than compensated).

However, if you only care about, say, Dirac, then this component is worth only 1.25 G3 Ghosts + 18.75 Fuel (Fuel obtained via salvaging the remaining G3 Ghosts), so 100 Time Swirl Pass buys 8.70 G3 Quartz + 40.97 Fuel. This is makes the legacy system very marginally worse.

Now let's look at G2 Stigma forging. Unfortunately, there are just too many useless and very low priority G2 Stigma sets. As I mentioned above, perhaps you may find that you need enough of them for S Event Bounty to be worthwhile, but you'll have to make that estimate for yourself.


### New system guidance

Quartz-based system.

(I call it Quartz to avoid confusion with Crystals and because we don't have an official translation yet.)

Quartz have grades, G1, G2, and G3.

Quartz have types, Ice, Fire, Lightning, and Phys.
- Ice tower stages drop Ice Quartz.
- Fire tower stages drop Fire Quartz.
- Lightning tower stages drop Lightning Quartz.
- Phys tower stages drop Phys Quartz.

You may choose the tower to challenge, thereby choosing to farm only the desired type of Quartz.

These are the Stigmata forging costs. The cost in Fuel and other mats is unchanged from the legacy system.
- | G1 direct | G2 direct | G2 transmute | G3 transmute
-- | -- | -- | -- | -- 
New mats cost | 190 G1 Quartz | 200 G2 Quartz | 125 G2 Quartz + G1 Stigma | 140 G3 Quartz + G2 Stigma
- | - | - | - | -
Ice Quartz | Nohime | Peary | Peary | Ana
Fire Quartz | Higo | Thales | Thales | (Leeuwenhoek?)
Lightning Quartz | Naga | Monet | Monet | Goemon
Phys Quartz | - | Mich | Mich | Dirac
- | - | - | - | -
_Fuel_ | 700 | 900 | 550 | 900
_Other mats_ | 80 Honkai Pieces + 150 SS Imaginon | 160 Purple Lens | 110 Purple Lens | 150 Red Lens 
- | - | - | - | -
_Legacy mats cost_ | 24 G1 Ghosts | 40 G2 Ghosts | 25 G2 Ghosts + G1 Stigma | 35 G3 Ghosts + G2 Stigma

According to Mihoyo, some Stigmata may require no Quartz to forge. The example provided was Ekaterina, which will "only require SS Imaginon to forge". And for more information, "Please refer to the beta server, Captains!"

These are the Weapon forging costs. The cost in Fuel and other mats is unchanged from the legacy system.
- | G1 Weapon direct | G2 Weapon direct
-- | -- | --
_New mats cost_ | 190 G1 Quartz | 250 G2 Quartz
- | - | -
- | G1 Weapon | Fenghuang Pinions
- | - | -
_Fuel_ | 700 | 1200
_Other mats_ | 80 Honkai Pieces + 150 AE Imaginon | 200 Purple Lens
- | - | -
_Legacy mats cost_ | 24 G1 Ghosts | 50 G2 Ghosts

##### Farming (Towers)

Four towers as follows.
- Ice tower stages drop Ice Quartz.
- Fire tower stages drop Fire Quartz.
- Lightning tower stages drop Lightning Quartz.
- Phys tower stages drop Phys Quartz.

Each tower has six floors.

Each floor can be cleared in solo mode or in coop mode. The coop mode will only be unlocked after completing the solo mode once.

10 Entry Tickets per week. Each floor costs 1 Entry Ticket. The first clear of a floor in solo mode will not cost an Entry Ticket.

No specific information was announced on the reset policy for towers. However, Mihoyo provided an example that suggests players may repeatedly farm floor 6, if so desired.

The rewards of floor clearing are as follows. The left side rewards are guaranteed. The right side rewards can be redeemed by spending Time Swirl Pass upon completing a floor.
Floor | Fuel | G1 Quartz | G2 Quartz | G3 Quartz | Spend Time Swirl Pass | Fuel | G1 Quartz | G2 Quartz | G3 Quartz
-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --
1 | 4 | 6 | 0 | 0 | 50 to get | 21 | 9 | 0 | 0
2 | 4 | 8 | 0 | 0 | 60 to get | 24 | 14 | 0 | 0
3 | 4 | 4 | 2 | 0 | 70 to get | 28 | 7 | 5 | 0
4 | 5 | 0 | 4 | 0 | 80 to get | 32 | 0 | 10 | 0
5 | 5 | 0 | 2 | 2 | 90 to get | 36 | 0 | 6 | 4
6 | 6 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 100 to get | 40 | 0 | 0 | 9

It costs 140 G3 Ice Quartz to forge one piece of Ana. Players can clear the 6th floor 12 times (10 times one week, 2 times the next week) at a cost of 1200 Time Swirl Pass to receive 144 Ana Ghosts.

Here is the normalized Time Swirl Pass payoff, i.e. the payoff on 100 Time Swirl Pass.
Floor | Fuel | G1 Quartz | G2 Quartz | G3 Quartz
-- | -- | -- | -- | --
1 | 42 | 18 | 0 | 0
2 | 40 | 23.33 | 0 | 0
3 | 40 | 10 | 7.14 | 0
4 | 40 | 0 | 12.5 | 0
5 | 40 | 0 | 6.66 | 4.44
6 | 40 | 0 | 0 | 9

The following will be used to calculate the value of Time Swirl Pass in the new system. The cost of a G3 Stigma from scratch, directly forging G2 Stigma, is as follows. 
1. Using Floor 5, 3000 Time Swirl Pass => 200 G2 Ghosts + 133.33 G3 Ghosts + 1200 Fuel
2. Using Floor 6, 74.07 Time Swirl Pass => 6.67 G3 Ghosts + 29.63 Fuel
3. Using Floor 6, 478.16 Time Swirl Pass => 320.37 Fuel
4. In addition, need 160 Purple Lens and 150 Red Lens. (At the time of writing, source is not known.)

1 G3 Stigma = 3552.24 Time Swirl Pass + 160 Purple Lens + 150 Red Lens

##### Converting between Quartz and Fuel

This system is the same for new and legacy.

I would not recommend converting Quartz to fuel because, unlike Ghosts of a particular piece of equipment, Quartz can be used commonly between many pieces of equipment. (That said, maybe you already have every currently forgeable piece of equipment.)

Converting Quartz to Fuel:
Equivalent Ghost | Equivalent Quartz | Equivalent Fuel
-- | -- | --
1 G1 Ghost | 8 G1 Quartz | 8 Fuel (1 G1 Quartz => 1 Fuel)
1 G2 Ghost | 5 G2 Quartz | 10 Fuel (1 G2 Quartz => 2 Fuel)
1 G3 Ghost | 4 G3 Quartz | 15 Fuel (1 G3 Quartz => 3 Fuel)

I would also not recommend converting Fuel to Quartz because the rate is not good, and Fuel is always scarce.

Converting Fuel to Quartz:
Equivalent Fuel | Equivalent Ghost | Equivalent Quartz
-- | -- | --
20 | 1 G2 Ghost | 5 G2 Quartz (1 G2 Quartz <= 4 Fuel)
30 | 1 G3 Ghost | 4.2 G3 Quartz (1 G3 Quartz <= 7 Fuel)


### Questions? Something looks not right?

I hope this helped. :)
