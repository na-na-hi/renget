#PSO Monsters Quick Notes

!!! danger Potential spoilers are bound to be had, including for Ultimate difficulty when notable. You've been warned!

This writeup is intended for some brief notes about certain enemy behavior and quirks, but does not go strictly in-depth - more of an intermediate step. Unlike its parent [Rentry writeup](https://rentry.co/advpso), it will be more explicit about finer details and enemy names.

Credit is due for some information in here coming off the Ephinea wiki and also a peer reviewer.

##Assorted Notes
If they might help you play better.

###General Play
- Target priority is the name of the game, and goes double in Episode 2 after the VR levels.
- While not on the level of Android traps, all Humans and Newmans can use Rabarta, Gifoie, and Razonde as crowd control tools where appropriate.
	- Zonde has a niche use in being able to quickly lock your character, similar to an 'auto-aim' special on some rare guns.
- Androids can use any pistol, rifle, or mechgun without lowered vertical angles to instantly shoot their own traps before they bounce up, and will point to the north in doing so.
	- There may be some consistency issues if the character is too small.
- Attacks that miss due to monster movement (ie using Baranz Launcher) is typically called 'manual evasion'.
- Flying enemies are typically vulnerable to infinite height attacks and techs.
	- The former can include Launcher weapons such as Cannon Rouge, and odd special attacks like that of Dark Flow.
- Divine Punishment from enemies is typically set damage, and unavoidable.

###Status
- Enemies have a special 'ESP' stat that determines resistance to status specials.
	- *Frozen Shooter's special has a 100% chance to freeze if the target isn't outright immune, as long as it hits with the accuracy check.*
- Androids get a +30% bonus to inflicting status in Ultimate.
	- This same +30% also nerfs their HP cut specials (Demon's goes from 25% to 55%).
- Paralysis (often referred as 'Arrest') and Freeze reduce monster EVP and stack, making attacks more accurate.
	- **Machines** are immune to paralysis.
	- Many, but not all flying enemies cannot be frozen in-flight.
	- On Ephinea, Freeze specials such as Blizzard have a +30% increase to their base rate.
- Confuse traps do a decent job at tying up common melee enemies, albeit with slightly reduced EXP.
- It is possible for enemies to be paralyzed or frozen while intangible.

###Techs / Megid
- Techs do not need to meet accuracy checks, but Jellen/Zalure and all offense techs still risk triggering damage cancelling (abbreviated as DMC).
- Megid compares against a target's EDK to determine the chance to instantly kill. **And some enemies don't give a single fuck regardless.**
- The Hell special is essentially akin to a fairly high level Megid, further complicated with accuracy checks, reduced specials on non-rare multihit/target weapons, and units that improvise it.
	- [Details and suggested use on given targets can be found here.](https://www.pioneer2.net/community/threads/i-cant-believed-that-worked.12731/)
	- Rare versions of enemies have higher EDK.
- Foie, Gibarta & Megid are projectiles, so they follow similar rules to other weapons with projectiles.
- Rafoie, Zonde, Gizonde & Grants are targeted, though not infinite can reach near the highest places compared to other weapons, especially at higher levels.
- Barta, Gifoie, & Razonde actually have infinite height despite appearing to be grounded.
	- This also somewhat applies to support techs which can work from different altitudes. Jellen/Zalure are simply a bigass circle (which is nigh room-wide with Glide Divine).

##Episode 1

###Forest
- **Rappies** that are attacked from a distance will be scared, causing them to drop an item. There is still a window that will let you hit them again for another, which is required to get any EXP out of them.
- **Hildebears** have more of a blindspot on their right.
- **Dragons** can be hit with any attacks that have infinite height while it is flying. At a certain point, its HP is locked until it takes off and can be slain before it begins its burrowing attack, forcing a landing.

###Caves
- **Lillies** can be stunlocked by a Force with Razonde.
	- **Ob Lilly** Megid is equivalent to Lv14 (66 EDK for full immunity).
	- If a **Mel Lilly** spawns, other Ob Lillies in the group may also use Lv28 Megid (96 EDK for full immunity).
- **Pan Arms** won't split if they are confused.
- **Slimes** and their children are instantly killed by android Fire Traps if they are placed and detonated near their original spawn point.
- 'Slime-splitting' is making extra slimes with Rabarta spam (the third hit in a combo also triggers this), up to three per parent.
- **Del Rol Le** targets only one player with its tendrils when it is beached on the craft.

###Mines
- Gifoie sees good use here in Ultimate, as many enemies are weak to fire.
- **Gillchic** have a large amount of rotational tracking on their melee attack unlike most other basic melee monsters.
	- In Ultimate, **Gillchich** have a small chance to not be knocked down after a single attack.
- **Dubchic** in some quests such as Ep1 Challenge Mode will need to be killed multiple times if a Dubwitch is absent.
- **Dubwitches** always have 300 HP in all difficulties and are typically vulnerable to ranged attacks before they're lowered. Even if they are wedged above doorways, they can still be hit by Bazookas such as Cannon Rouge.
- Both **Sinow** variants attack twice before leaping backwards. A *Beat* (Blue) makes clones with no damage but collision, a *Gold* (Red) can turn invisible.
- Try going behind a **Garanz** if lockdown is out of the question.
- **Vol Opt**'s first phase is kind of fucked in how it takes physical damage from its terminals, and can be stunlocked by a Ranger with both Spread Needle and Heavenly/Battle or V101, or a Force using Gizonde while holding a strong weapon with high Machine attribute.
	- In challenge mode, you may be better off knocking out the red pillars and ignoring the terminals.
	- Both phases can't be struck with Jellen/Zalure.

###Ruins

- **Delsaber** shields block three attacks before the light goes out, which is reignited when it strikes a target. Any tech attack will force it to play an extended stun animation.
	- Most Delsabers will prioritize Force players if not engaged in melee.
- **Chaos Bringer** charges may be stopped with Gifoie. Their melee attack has the same blindspot as a Hildebear.
	- **Dark Bringer** charges also disarm the player on hit.
- **Chaos Sorcerers** start with casting Rafoie. **Gran Sorcerers** conversely start with Grants and also have Megid (98 EDK required for full immunity). Both prioritise Rangers.
- **Dark Belra** arms are not launched from the center. They will get stunned if they circle around chasing a player for a few seconds.
- **Dark Falz:**
	- **Darvants** pre-fight have 300 HP in Ultimate. Guns work for Hunters and Rangers, Forces can use Gifoie decently.
	- The third phase is exempt from Normal difficulty and by extension, Challenge Mode.
	- Divine Punishment and the few other attacks which *aren't* based on elemental techs will do set damage.
	- Dark Falz's invulnerable state in Phase 3 can be hurt through with techs and some specials like Burning and Gush, being noticeable weaker to Fire.
	- There is no avoiding Grants, but it will be skipped if the orbs kill a player, and can be resisted with any ELT sources.
	- The 'soul steal' attack ends when the targeted player dies, or after the following Megid + Grants attack if they survive.

##Episode 2: Megid Boogaloo

!!! warning Notes
	Recurring enemies in Ep2's VR levels have somewhat different stats! EDK is also surprisingly lower than average between a lot of weaker monsters and thus the use of Hell specials is more popular in Episode 2, but there are also higher priority targets in some areas.

###VR Temple
- **Monests** in Ep2 have the lowest EDK in the game.
- **Dark Belra** and *all* **Dimenian** variants are overall weaker in Ep2.
- **Barba Ray**'s tentacle attacks from below the craft are telegraphed by faint particle effects on the floor before they strike.

###VR Spaceship
- **Pan Arms** in Ep2 have a lot less DFP than they do in Ep1.
- **Dubwitches** are a lot more abused by infinite height attacks.
- **Delsabers** surprisingly have somewhat low EDK here, and are also overall weaker in Ep2.
- **Gol Dragon** is still vulnerable to infinite height attacks like its predecessor, but cannot be afflicted by Jellen/Zalure.

###Central Control Area
!!! warning CCA minibosses don't take extra damage from weapon attributes.
- **Zol Gibbon** cast Level 2 Megid (30 EDK for full immunity).
- **Sinow Spigell** have a chance to disarm players on hit.
- **Gi Gue** can erect a shield that when struck, ignores incoming damage (which will stay up if frozen) and also lobs a fire damage bomb. It may also cast Jellen or Zalure.
- Most **Gibbles** will prioritize male characters.
- The **Mericarol** family's dark (Megid)-based spit and gas attacks are impossible to be immune to in Ultimate.
- **Gal Gryphon**'s opening attack can be simply dodged by not moving at the start, and like previous flying bosses is vulnerable to infinite height attacks.
	- Do not cast Jellen on this motherfucker.

###Seabed
- **Morfos** won't attack the player if they spawned and remain offscreen, and are surprisingly vulnerable to Hell specials for a Dark monster.
- If a **Recobox** is destroyed, all Recons go with it.
- **Sinow Zele** have a chance to disarm players on hit, and are slightly more vulnerable to Hell/Megid than their blue counterparts.
- **Deldepths** have the highest EVP of all monsters and retreat once hit normally. Consider freezing them.
- **Delbiters** are very chunky and fast boys with even a projectile. Charges can be stopped with Gifoie.
- **Olga Flow**:
	- The first phase will require a weapon of at least handgun range or better for consistent damage.
	- Wait for Olga Flow in phase 2 to start looking around before attacking, otherwise it will start to use Divine Punishment.
	- If Gael or Giel touch you during Divine Punishment, you're all fucked.
	- During its body swap attack, it gets a random monster attribute; the player bodyswapped to Flowen must hit Olga with weapons of that attribute to not have the damage mirrored back to them.

###Control Tower
- This is the hardest area in the game with some enemies from both the CCA and Seabed.
- While generally lower priority, **Del Lillies** can reduce player HP to 1, and cast Lv26 Megid (92 EDK for full immunity).
- **Ill Gills** have very high EVP and DFP, Zalure should be used. The Scythe attack is dark and thus requires 100 EDK for immunity.
- **Epsilon** will move closely to one player and will cast Rafoie a few times before deploying Epsiguards; take care of any external threats and have the party huddle up. It cannot be frozen and Zalure must also be used to deal any real damage outside of Demon specials.
	- Purple **Epsiguard** hit with Megid that is impossible to be immune to in Ultimate.

##Episode 4: Blue Balls

!!! warning Notes
	Ep4 tends to bode well for nuking as a Force. If you are a Ranger, take a decent or good melee beatstick with you.

###Crater
- **Sand Rappies** too, get scared.
- **Satellite Lizards and Yowies** cannot be harmed by ranged weapons (including slicers) from the front.
- **Zu** cannot be frozen or arrested; they will also have increased EVP during charges, but can be stopped with Gifoie or any successful attack. Any flinching from attacks will reset its pattern.
- **Dorphon** cannot be frozen or confused, but may be paralyzed. Likewise, charges may be interrupted with Gifoie as well.

###Subterranean Desert
- All **Goran** enemies are surprisingly vulnerable to paralysis and confusion.
- **Merissa A** despite their bullshit are still vulnerable to Gifoie.
- **Girtablulu** cannot be frozen, but can be paralyzed. Their health is also typically cut with Demon specials.
- If the Force player can survive **Saint Milion**'s attacks, they can solo the cave segment(s) and break the crystals as needed while the other players can camp where it retreats back to.
- Shambertin (Point of Disaster) and Kondrieu (1 in 10 chance of replacing either snek) are largely identical beyond weakness swaps and differing loot tables.
