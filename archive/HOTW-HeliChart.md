#Heli Relationship List
**Kara Ramirez**
"What a cutie. It's such a shame, the wasteland making girls that young act like adults too soon. But you know what they say, can't save'em all. And she's pretty good at saving herself mostly. I think it's a point of pride that she pays her own way, so I don't hurt her by workin' probono. I can't refuse a face like that, anyways. She's gonna make a lucky somebody a damned good bride, one day, with cookin' like she does. There's two fast ways to anyone's heart, but the poets recommend the stomach route."
**Ultra Magnus**
"Gotdamn! Nuttier'n squirrel shit, like we use't'say. Don't tell Doc I said that. I don' want her repeatin' it. Bad habit I picked up from my Daddy. Anyway he fights like a demon. You'd need some kinda weird magic to bring that guy down. I figure anybody that fuckhuge - sorry - has got to be some manner'a mutant but he looks pretty normal besides the proportions. Genetics ain't my thing, really. Biochemistry is jus' somethin' I've got an overview on. Lissen, if you wanna know about Big Magnus, there's no replacement for walkin' beside him. No description is gonna do it justice. If you ain't living garbage, he won't turn you out, so take the chance. He's got a code or somethin', that one."
**Ramses**
"Some nutjob crank. Gonna get a lot of good people killed on both sides."
**Calliope, Rocker of the Ruins**
"What a fuckin' waste."
**Dr. Charles Crane**
"Good man. Straight shooter, pays on time, lends an ear. But only when he's got one on ice, ha! Can't tell if there's a lot of mystery to him or not a lot goin' on 't'all. It's strange. I got the sense that he doesn't exactly mind wanderin' but that he's not got that ache for the horizon like so many walkin' the roads. Maybe he just takes each moment as it comes. Sounds peaceful. I envy him that."
**The Nymphs - Glimmer / Bliss / Doe / Kitty / Sprite**
"Nymphs, huh? Jungle nymphs. Nymphs in the jungle. A colony of beautiful, dangerous women that live away from everybody. ...Hm. Nymphs. That's in'trestin'. Probably not true."
**Mike the driver**
"Oh, sure, everyone's met Mike. Not for long, though, usually. He's a busy man, got a lot to handle on that tub 'uh his. I'd like to see the guts of that behemoth someday. Uh, the sandcrawler, a'course. He's a skinny fella. Mike. Honest guy, and no one has a bad word to say 'bout him. Which either means he's a rare good sort or that he always leaves the people he wrongs where no one will ever find'em. Takes my tickets without fuss, mind you."
**Ricky W. Booth**
"He's a kinda radio celebrity, I reckon. Chatterbox on the airwaves. He never did get back to me about that old tech he scrounged... must've found a proper buyer. Shame."
**Hannah Ossus**
"Heheh, oh, well, you know how it is."
**Karnak**
"Another radio fella. I like the tunes but I have to pretend the talky bits are fiction to take it. Surprisin' that they're tryin' to start a war in public and no one's doin' anythin' about it. Well, I guess I'm not either. Could it be everyone just thinks it ain't their fight and waits until the next song?"
