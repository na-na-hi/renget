####2023 Convention agenda
This convention agenda focuses on Dutch events but includes some of the more popular foreign events with the Dutch community. Markets/fairs and gatherings are excluded from the list to help me keep my sanity. If you're interested in those, I suggest checking [the Sushi Times](https://www.thesushitimes.com/japanse-evenementen/) who keep track of Japan/anime related events. There's also [FanCons.com](https://fancons.com/events/schedule.php?type=all&loc=eu) which tries to keep track of conventions worldwide and offers search filters for genres and regions. Note, not all conventions are present on their site.

#####Events still without a date
- [ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡± Animecon Classic](https://animecon.nl/classic/nl/): Seems to have been axed, but no official statement has been made.
- [ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡± Nishicon](https://www.nishicon.nl/): had to move from November 2023 to 2024 due to "location staffing" problems.
- [ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡± Imaginarium Festival](https://www.imaginarium-festival.nl/): A fantasy event that's currently undergoing a takeover to restructure themselves into a (non-profit) foundation with the goal to expand. Have stated they will return in 2024 [(source)](https://www.imaginarium-festival.nl/nieuws/52).

####Other Convention stuff
#####I need help picking a convention that suits me
| **I want lots of quality content to do** | **I want to cosplay and/or compete in competitions** |
|---|---|
| For **anime fans** I can recommend Abunai! and Animecon (classic). They have the largest focus on content and most of it will be included with your entry ticket or requires a cheap additional event ticket. Sadly, **geek and fantasy** events cater more towards merch and ambience. | **Beginning cosplayers** can pretty much visit any convention they want but Abunai! is known for beginner friendly competitions and lectures. If instead of a competition you want to participate in a catwalk you can find those at most conventions including Abunai!, Animecon, TomoCon, Nishicon and Heroes Dutch Comic Con. **Experienced cosplayers** looking for serious competition or price money are better off at Animecon and Heroes Dutch Comic Con. |
| **I just want to hang with friends** | **I want to buy merch** |
| Hanging with friends is something you can do at any convention. If you're looking for something cheap TomoCon and the many TomoFairs will be perfect to hang and entertain each other. Heroes Dutch Comic Con usually has a lot of geek culture fandom/cosplay meetups. | **Anime fans** are best off at Animecon (Regular) which has the largest dealer room. Heroes MIA and TomoFair also offer plenty of dealers which is great if you aren't looking for anything specific. If you are looking for artists Abunai! is definitely the place to go with their large artist alley. **Geeks** are best off at Heroes Dutch Comic Con, but beware of bootlegs.  **Fantasy fans** are best off at Castlefest and Elfia. |

#####What's the deal with commercial and non-profit conventions and why should I care?
Non-profit conventions are run by foundations that consist entirely of (unpaid) volunteers. These foundations are not allowed to make any profit and as such every euro they receive has to be spent on their convention and/or foundation goal. Foundation goals will typically include the promotion of Japanese or geek culture and investing into the weeb or geek community. As a foundation, they are also required to be transparent about their finances, especially if they have a (cultural) [ANBI status](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/bldcontentnl/belastingdienst/zakelijk/bijzondere_regelingen/goede_doelen/algemeen_nut_beogende_instellingen/wat_is_een_anbi).

Commercial (for-profit) conventions on the other hand are run by a professional team of paid employees. Their main goal is to make a profit to keep their investors and shareholders happy. These conventions will often use unpaid volunteers for lesser tasks, but offer a better volunteer compensation for their time. Between the two there is no "good" or "bad" as both types manage to create appealing conventions with different styles:

| **Non-Profits** | **Commercial/For-Profit** |
|---|---|
| Lower entry price | Higher entry price | 
| Focused more on content and culture | Focused more on size, dealers and special guests |
| Not allowed to make any profit | Active focus on making a profit |
| Cheaper dealer and artist tables | Expensive dealer and artist tables |
| Fewer visitors (usually up to 12k) | More visitors (usually up to 60k) |
| Genuine care for community and visitor well-being | Little care for community or visitor well-being |
| Fully organized and executed by (unpaid) volunteers | Organized by paid staff, executed with help from unpaid volunteers |
| Little compensation for volunteers | Better compensations for volunteers |


#####General advice for visiting (Dutch) conventions
- **For foreigners...** Dutch conventions are typically hosted in English and have plenty of English speaking volunteers available. French and German are often also taught to those in high school, but don't expect any "proper conversations" from the average Henk. The public transport system is extremely reliable in the Netherlands, fully integrated with Google Maps and requires the use of loose tickets or a [OV Chipkaart](https://www.ov-chipkaart.nl/everything-about-travelling/different-types-of-passenger/tourists.htm). Our infrastructure is also friendly towards cyclists and those walking. And finally, if you walk on the red bicycle paths we will run you over to colour the path a deeper shade of red with your blood.
- **Buy your tickets early.** Not only do some conventions offer a discount for early buyers, it also helps them out massively with some much needed early cash flow.
- **Check the convention hotel situation!** Some conventions (*ahem, Abunai!*) take place inside a hotel or congress center, which has their rooms only available through special sign-up pages or packages. Typically these pages will open to everyone on a specific date and time resulting in what is often referred to as *the Hunger Games*.
- **Book hotel rooms early if possible and share your room if possible to save on costs.** If you want to stay at another hotel or there is no special sign-up in place, you do well in booking early. Aside from the obvious early booking discount, a lot of hotels will significantly raise room prices the moment they find out a large event will be held near them. Keep an eye out for announcements ~~or leaks~~ and book the moment you find out. Most hotels have an option where you can cancel free of charge and don't pay for your room until you arrive anyway, so cost or wrong information shouldn't be an issue.
- **Always check convention rules and regulations, especially if cosplaying!** Every event has their own set of rules. In general items containing metal/iron will not be allowed, weapons need to follow weapon laws [(more info here)](https://www.vraaghetdepolitie.nl/wapens/nepwapens) and NERF guns will need to have their trigger made unusable. Some conventions will also not allow you bring in your own drinks or food, large bags or recreational nuclear weapons.
- **Stay hydrated!!!** *This bullet point is brought to you by [HydroHomies](https://www.reddit.com/r/HydroHomies/)
- **Convention crew and volunteers are there to help you!** If you run into any unacceptable behaviour, unsafe situations, bootlegs or think you or someone around you is in need of help, you can always approach them and ask for help or report your findings.
- **Bring a small EDC kit along.** Powerbank, pain killers, medication, emergency sewing supply, tube of superglue and such are items you can easily fit in your pocket or a small pouch and will save your ass when in a pinch.

####Thread, Discord and OP things
#####Dutch Gulls Discord
We have a Discord server [(invite here)](https://discord.gg/QAYNyfY) which is open to anyone to join. However keep in mind 4chan isn't Discord and vice versa. We like to keep things comfy in our little hangout and access to the Discord is a privilege, not a right. Behaving like a toxic prick, manchild, /pol/tard or harassing or targeting members will get you banned. Ban appeals can be performed by email, ban evasion will result in a permaban. 

#####Contacting OP
You can contact me at dutchthreadop \[apenlul\] gmail.com or on Discord.

####What happened to the old duthgulls.nl website?
I used to run multiple websites on the same hosting package which I got for my private website and email. This meant for each additional site I wanted to add I only had to pay for the domain name. Sadly, the hosting company doubled their prices and changed policies and effective January 1st 2023 requires separate hosting packages for each site. The cost this would add even when moving hosts combined with the drop in use of the site and loss of motivation to keep it updated lead me to decide to cancel it. 2016-2022, it was fun while it lasted!

I did download a backup of the site and databases and also had the Internet Archive make one final snapshot before I took the site offline. This snapshot can be found at https://web.archive.org/web/20221215132318/https://dutchgulls.nl/
