&emsp; &emsp;This bar doesn’t seem bad at all, I thought to myself as I was drinking a glass of beer, looking around at people here. There were a lot of demons here, since this particular place decided to gain new customers by changing the services and music to something more suitable for our new hellish neighbours and some humans, too. The music was mostly metal, usually of some heavier variety. I couldn’t complain. The décor has also changed, with blinking colourful neon lights being replaced by warm fires in walls, making the whole place cosier while keeping it lively. I was in the room with a bar where an Archvile bartender was servicing other drinkers, but there was another room, a small concert hall where random bands would play, but there was none tonight. As a result, there wasn’t as many people here, save for a few groups of partying Imps, a circle of Hell Knights contesting who can drink more shots of liquor and a few humans talking and dancing with other demons.
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;“You come here often?”
&emsp; &emsp;I turned around and saw an Imp girl, fourth plane, alone, with a beer in her hand. She wore mismatched clothes, like many other demons, a black t-shirt with some metal band’s illustration (looked pretty badass) and sweatpants. And, wow, she had awesome hair. A very thin, bright red mohawk that increased her a bit wild appearance as she’s apparently chosen to have her orange chitin-like face armour intact.
&emsp; &emsp;“Nah, I’m here for the first time. Looks cool, though.” I responded and told her my name. No point in lying.
&emsp; &emsp;“Yea, me too. I like it, feels right at home here, y’know? Name’s Kirana, by the way, at least that’s the best way others can pronounce it.” She took a drink of her beer. Damn, she looked amazing. The hair seemed natural, it moved around when she nodded her head, it didn’t look gelled or anything to stay in shape. Not knowing what to say, I took a sip of my drink, too.
&emsp; &emsp;She noticed the empty spot next to me and sat down. Well, more like jumped up as the stool was almost as tall as she was, it was quite high even for me.
&emsp; &emsp;“What do you think of the music?” She asked, subtly pointing her shoulder to the ceiling, where the speakers probably were. It sounded like a mix of power and trash metal but much faster and at least an octave lower, but probably more. It was gritty and rough but it had nice structure and overall sounded great, perfect for some head banging.
&emsp; &emsp;“I like it, what’s that band?” I asked. The Imp produced a shriek and made a few clicks with her jaw. At first I thought something wrong happened before realising that it’s probably the group’s name. A demon band? I asked about it.
&emsp; &emsp;“Yeah, not many of ‘em but damn, they’re awesome. This whole music thing you humans got is awesome!” She responded before finishing her beer. “Oh, and they are here next week.”
&emsp; &emsp;“Really? We might go toge-“ I stopped myself, not yet drunk enough to be able to ask anyone out. She didn’t notice my stutter and replied with a wide smile, “You… you would? That’s great!”
&emsp; &emsp;I noticed her eyes got brighter while saying that and I finished my beer in the meantime. I didn’t plan to get shitfaced, but just drunk enough for the world to feel good.
&emsp; &emsp;“Hey, want another one?” I asked, nodding at the two empty glasses covered in white foam.
&emsp; &emsp;“Hell yeah!” Indeed. After both of us took a good sip from our pints, I started feeling getting drunker, making me less shy.
&emsp; &emsp;“I like your hair.” I remarked. It really did look pretty. Her eyes brightened even more.
&emsp; &emsp;“Thanks. I li… I like yours too.” That made me blush a bit so I looked away, smiling a little. I noticed most other Imps were in a group with others, this one was alone.
&emsp; &emsp;“What are you doing here alone, anyway?” I asked. Her smile dropped a little, “I was the only one of my pack left before I got here and we never join with other packs, so I escaped.” Damn.
&emsp; &emsp;“When did you get here?” She seemed somewhat experienced with the life here.
&emsp; &emsp;“About a month ago. I’ve been looking for some packs to join but we’re still not open to inviting random fellas spawn to our, what is the human word, families. But I thought I could find a company sooner. Is there something wrong with me?”
&emsp; &emsp;I tried to comfort her, “No, it’s not... I think.” I tried to chuckle a bit and it looked like she relaxed a little but not much. I continued, gently grabbing her hand below the table, “Come on, you’ll find friends here, don’t worry about it.” That seemed to work, she smiled a bit and her posture softened up, somewhat.
&emsp; &emsp;“It’s a bit crowded here, don’t you think?” It really wasn’t. She laughed a bit at my attempt; it sounded cute, but somewhat wild and tribal. I loved that sound. I took another sip and pressed on, “Would you like to come over to my place?”
&emsp; &emsp;She seemed to be checking me a little but she looked decided already.
&emsp; &emsp;“Why not?”
&emsp; &emsp;We finished our beers and left.
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;The night air was colder than the bar’s but still quite warm and humid. The Mars City was closely packed together, so the walk home was pretty short – the only public transit were trams to remote facilities, anyway. At first we were just holding hands but before the five minute walk was over me and Kirana (or Kira for short) were already making out, kissing slowly. She was too short for us to kiss comfortably in a standing position, so I grabbed her and she sat on my arm while I held her back with the other. Her bluish black skin on her face was smooth and smelled a little bit of sulphur, but not in an unpleasant way. Our tongues quickly met each other, hers was rough but it felt nice to rub them together when covered in saliva. Her teeth were very sharp and there were a few times she bit me accidentally, but I didn’t mind or feel it in the drunken haze. Obviously, us being invested in each other slowed the way home a bit, but before long we were standing in front of my door that opened automatically with a quiet “Access granted. Welcome home.”
&emsp; &emsp;We let go of each other and stepped inside.
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;It was a small apartment, standard for all regular UAC employees, but it was nice and cosy. From the little hallway there were several doors, one leading to a small living room, another going to my room and the last one leading to the bathroom. There were empty spots in the hallway, in case more rooms were to be installed. Those flats were very modular and the layout of whole apartments could be changed in a matter of days, if needed.
&emsp; &emsp;“Take off your shoes if you want, it doesn’t matter. Want something to drink?” I asked. I wasn’t used to having guests but I knew some of the basics.
&emsp; &emsp;“Nah, I’m good. That your room?” She pointed to one of the doors.
&emsp; &emsp;“Yeah, want to look inside?” She didn’t hesitate and we entered.
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;My room was small but at least it was easier to clean. A comfy bed in one corner, a wardrobe with clothes in the other and a desk with a computer, papers and an empty glass in the third, what more could I ask for? The metallic walls were covered with a façade emulating the look of a plaster that looked orange in the warm light of the lamp I turned on. Opposing the door was a large window that let the daylight illuminate the whole room but it was already long dark outside.
&emsp; &emsp;“Looks nice.” The Imp judged.
&emsp; &emsp;“Heh, thanks. It’s a bit empty now, I moved in recently.” I felt a bit awkward but she didn’t seem to mind. She turned her head and looked at the bed covered in pillows and then at me and talked to me with a lower voice, “That bed looks comfy.”
&emsp; &emsp;“Wanna try it?”
&emsp; &emsp;She grinned before tackling me on the bed and jumping on me unexpectedly, her red hair flying in the air before she joined her lips with mine, passionately making out with me while rubbing her body against me. It was hot and rough and my shirt and body were full of tiny scratches before my clothes were down. She sat up and took off her own t-shirt, revealing her perky orange breasts. I didn’t have time to enjoy the view before she leaned closer again and forced one of the boobs in my mouth. I suckled and nibbled on them, indulging on the sulphurous flavour. Every time I squeezed them with my mouth Kira sighed in pleasure. She began grinding her crotch against my stomach, slowly moving lower to my pants while I hugged her closely, my arms around her spiky back.
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;Suddenly, she stopped and grabbed the bulge in my pants with her clawed hand. She squeezed it gently a few times, causing me to pant slightly while her luscious smile grew wider.
&emsp; &emsp;“Not yet.” She said in a low voice and grabbed the top of my shirt before taking it off with one hand and doing the same with her sweatpants with the other. She threw both away and put her other breast in my mouth. I knew what to do. Meanwhile, she was grinding her now exposed pussy against my naked abs, leaving a shimmering trail on my stomach. She began to moan slightly and my erection grew even bigger. I raised my arm and stuck a few fingers between my torso and her, massaging her clit slightly before going inside. My fingers could do much more than she could grinding against the surface of my body and her response was quite vocal, with short melodic shrieks resonating through the room along with Kira's moans.
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;I backed off and moved the sticky hand away before smelling and licking it. It had an unexplainable taste but I loved it. Kira looked at me and I asked her, “And now?”
&emsp; &emsp;She responded by grabbing my pants and quickly taking them off. She froze in place, admiring my standing dick. She grabbed it in her hand and squeezed it slightly, earning a groan from me, before jerking it slowly a few times. She picked up the speed while fingering her pussy with the other hand. She leaned in closer and licked it, tasting it. As I almost reached the point of no return, she stopped both her hands and crawled closer. She lifted herself before slowly mounting me. God, she was tight. And hot. I thought it wouldn’t fit but with patience she slowly sat down with my full length inside her with intense warmth surrounding the entirety of my member. Her insides felt smoothly ridged and strongly massaged me all the way. She let out a long moan before moving up again and back down. Each thrust sent a wave of pleasure through my body that kept getting better each time Kira sat down. She gradually sped up, her vagina getting used to me and my cock covered in her slick juices as I began moving in rhythm.
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;She grabbed my shoulders and locked her eyes with mine while ploughing me at an increasing pace. Her mouth was open and her smile was gone, replaced by the look of pure ecstasy with drool flying out and her eyes glowing. I noticed strobing lights coming from where she was holding me. My shoulders were quite literally on fire, but it didn’t hurt, I only felt strange warm fuzziness. Her riding my cock; her tits jumping around; her hands clawing in my arms with flames coming out of them; her fiery hair flying around; I was getting close, so close.
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;Suddenly, she tensed up, gripped my shoulders painfully with her claws and the insides of her vagina tightened around my penis as she climaxed, letting out cries of pleasure, stronger than her previous sounds. She closed her eyes and stuck out her slimy tongue, shaking uncontrollably and holding on to me. I picked up the pace even more while her insides were clamped on me and just a few seconds after her, I came, letting out a deep moan mixed with a growl as I shot loads of cum in her. I kept pumping her, gradually slowing down as waves of pleasure slowly diminished, leaving us in warm, careless bliss. Her breath was ragged and she was shaking as she slowly laid her body down on mine, still hugging me closely. I was still inside her and even though I was getting soft, I didn’t pull out; she was that tight, but not enough for my seed to stay inside as it was slowly dripping out.
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;Still in firm embrace, she spoke in a quiet, tired voice, “That… was amazing… I didn’t know… I didn’t know it could be this good. How humans could make this so nice.”
&emsp; &emsp;I smiled, “You were amazing, too, Kirana.”
&emsp; &emsp;We joined our lips in a short but slow and sensual kiss. When we parted, she looked a bit embarassed for a moment.
&emsp; &emsp;“Can… Can I stay overnight?”
&emsp; &emsp;Seriously? I didn’t even say anything and responded by just put a blanket over us, keeping us warm.
&emsp; &emsp;“Thank you.”
&emsp; &emsp;She barely managed to say it as she drifted away into the calmness of sleep. Before I remotely switched the lights off, I saw a tear coming down her face.
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;When I woke up, Kira was lying next to me, eyes closed. She looked so peaceful when sleeping, which contrasted to her otherwise wild face and sharp natural facial armour. The sun was slowly peeking through the blinds of the room’s window but I didn’t want to leave the warm bed. I didn’t have to, anyway. I snuggled closer to the red-haired Imp and closed my eyes again.
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;I opened my eyes once more and was greeted by a pair of glowing lights looking at me. She was awake.
&emsp; &emsp;“Good morning, Kira.”
&emsp; &emsp;She responded by kissing me on my cheek, scratching me slightly in the process with her mandibles.
&emsp; &emsp;“Mornin’.”
&emsp; &emsp;I looked at the window. The shadows moved only slightly, so I wasn’t asleep for long. I looked back at my lover and asked, “How was the sleep?”
&emsp; &emsp;“Soft. Comfy. And a bit squishy.” She said, nagging me a little. We shared a kiss and realized how hungry I am. At least there was no hangover.
&emsp; &emsp;“So, what do you want for breakfast?” I didn’t realise Kira probably didn’t know much about human cuisine; I’ll have to show her some stuff later. I tried to leave the bed but the demon hummed quietly and pulled me in, further keeping us in the warm embrace.
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;We might as well sleep in for a little longer, anyway.
