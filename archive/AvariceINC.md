Lets be honest, there's only two that are technically NSFW and you still have to go out of the way for them. 
So what I'm listing is free to use in an SFW way, despite what the pictures may imply. But if you're here- you know what you're looking at anyway so go ham.

Essentially you have a doting wolf mommy who wants to comfort and care for you. But as the full moon rises she becomes more needy and sexually aggressive. Eventually, she will rape if she needs to.

![Clown town](https://files.catbox.moe/i4ug2v.png) | Yipyow the clown | A laughing lagomorph to lighten the load of a ludicrous life. Only she's also kind of super depressed? Maybe you can fix her, or just enjoy her persona. Up to you.

##Lore books.

Equis homestead FEMALE lorebook. Has the girls inside, you don't *need* the card, but it is recommended. https://files.catbox.moe/f4iqel.json
Equis homestead MALE lorebook. Has the boys inside, you don't *need* the card, but it is recommended. https://files.catbox.moe/heg29e.json
Cat box! Basically just a short lorebook entry to make Catbox availible anywhere. I tried to keep it under 200 context so that it doesn't pass the default token values. https://files.catbox.moe/f4iqel.json
