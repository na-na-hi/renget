>be tech intern at Cover
>you do various troubleshooting and IT for the support staff
>you rarely, if ever, see the actual talents of Hololive
>'maybe it's for the best', you think
>you had to sign a bunch of paperwork you didn't really read, NDAs and stuff, to get hired
>today, though, is one of those days
>nothing works, every chance at a break is interrupted by something stupid, you're tired
>you've been watching the clock in the office
>watching the minute hand creep through the last hour of your shift
>you really just want to grab your shit and clock out
>as you finish trying to figure out how a staffer's 4080 rig runs like it's from 2013, you take a look at the clock
>15 minutes before shift end
>good enough for you, time to grab your stuff out of the lockers in the back and GTFO
>you hustle to the backroom at the fastest speedwalk you can manage without looking like you're rushing
>you get to your locker
>it usually just has a place to hang your uniform jacket, nametag, and any valuables you want to keep safe during the shift
>you usually just use it for hanging your uniform jacket, personally
>but today, you take one look at the combination lock on the door; you take a step back
>were you so tired this morning you forgot to lock your locker?
>the lock is in the door, but not actually locked
>thankfully you didn't have anything valuable in there, but that's weir-
>"i-is someone there...? Could you open the door...?"
>you petrify mid-reach towards the lock
>you recognize it
>you easily recognize it
>it's not just your boss, it's your boss's boss
>A-chan
>Your head whirls around, looking for the origin of the voice
>you don't see her, but you look around you one more time
>what door did she need you to open? you want to go home, like right the fuck now
>what could she possibly need from you at this time in the shift anyway?"
>"Hello...? The locker door plEEAse?!"
>that sharp rise in her voice followed by a rapid-fire 'fuck!' told you something was up
>but more than that, it told you something weirder
>it came from your locker
>steeling yourself for whatever you might see, you open your locker
>the immediate smell of sweat wafts out
>you're staring right at a dark expanse of fabric, with the Cover triangle plastered right in the center
>a t-shirt
>"G-Get me down, get me down, please"
>you are mesmerized
>following that, you look up to see A-chan's firetruck red face, drenched in sweat
>she's looking down at you, literally - but how? she's not taller than you.
>she shuffles in the half-second you try to process it all
>her hands are against the tiny, rectangular locker's walls
>her t-shirt is riding up, you can see her belly button
>you can see a V-shape of fabric rising up and out of her jeans, even in front
>the grey elastic follows a very worn and unflattering canvas of faded red strawberries against a backdrop of off-white
>panties
>A-chan's panties
>your eyes dart up her back, following the left band you can see more of those strawberries
>up, up, up and then disappearing behind A-chan's back 
>exactly on the spot you know usually hosts the twin hooks for your jacket
>yep
>A-chan is strung up in your locker by her goddamn panties
>her toes, clad in loafers, are dusting the floor of the locker, at best
>pops of fabric, creaking under weight
>"A-Anon, this hurts, come on...!"
>her voice is sharp but also a whisper
>fair, she doesn't want to draw attention to herself hanging by her panties like it's highschool all over again
>"how?"
>you're tired, you're not touching anything close to upper-management's panties
>you are not getting fired 10 minutes before your shift for sexual harassment
>"Look, Suicha- Suisei put me up here, just unsnag the-"
>more groans from the panties are followed by groans from her
>her ass is burning, the sweat on her face isn't just from humiliation
>it's all the effort she's spent trying not to squeal
>"Just unsnag them from behind me... b-before they ri-rihp..."
>she wants you to touch them, at least for the purpose of saving her from tasting those strawberries in the back of her throat
>"I don't want to touch your..."
>she knows what you mean, you know what you mean
>her eyes wide, she scrambles harder to get your help than she is to gain her footing in the locker
>"you can, you can, it's fine. these aren't one of my nice pairs!"
>no kidding, strawberry butt
>you have no out now, you want to go home anyway
>you step one foot into the locker, immediately correcting the height discrepancy
>but now you are close enough to recognize her size
>she's flat, she's slender, you could manhandle her if you wanted right now
>the smell of her stale sweat, all trapped in the heat of the locker, wafts to you
>you're maybe half-an-inch from having your crotch brush against her thigh
>she's squirming even as you try to look behind her to find the origin of the wedgie
>you look past her shoulder
>that half-inch of clearance between your pants and her leg suddenly gets much less
>you can see her ass crack, split evenly by strawberry panties as you look down
>pale cheeks half hanging-out of her jeans, all visible to you
>you were not mentally prepared for all this sensory overload
>your now-clammy hands reach past A-chan's right shoulder, over and back towards the taut bulb of panties wrapped over the hooks
>'A-chan' on the center-middle of that unsexy waistband
>but that's not her na-
>the panties give another serious inch
>the newfound slack in the elastic and fabric bounces A-chan
>a girly squeal
>the wedgie bounces her directly against your chest, hers against yours, her leg against your crotch
>it's time to go
>you are not getting fired because you popped a boner trying to save A-chan from a hanging wedgie
>you frantically pick at the hooks, not really thinking as you pull up and away from the hooks
>"Oooh, fuck!"
>the hook is no longer giving her a wedgie, you are
>you are holding A-chan up by her panties
>those fat asscheeks are at your mercy, her sweaty panties are seeping their heat and dampness into your palms
>and A-chan is pinned against your own chest by the angle you hold her
>you still have to clear the hooks to free her though
>you're pretty sure you hear the nerd moan for 'mommy' as you wrench the underwear past the hooks
>you get a peek of her whole ass as the back of her jeans is pulled away by the column of panties during this process
>cute, plump cheeks; no doubt plush from the hours of sitting on them
>you get A-chan free of the hooks and let go instantly
>the elastic snaps back like a worn-out rubber band
>the snap draws one more coo from A-chan against your body
>and now reality sets in
>A-chan is sweaty, her underwear half out of her pants, against you
>her leg against your unadjusted member
>you step back and out of the locker, nearly eating shit in the rush
>A-chan is probably about to fire you here and now
>you look at the floor
>you wait
>you wait a second longer
>"I'm going to get her so bad... uuughhh..."
>her?
>you look up sheepishly
>A-chan is double-handed down the front of her jeans
>you don't need to see to know she's fixing the rocket cameltoe that ordeal gave her
>she catches you staring but...
>"I- thanks? That won't happen again..."
>she's drenched in sweat
>she's trying to stuff her mangled nerd-panties back into her jeans
>you say something stupid to break the ice
>"those are probably ruined"
>"oh, I think I'm going commando the rest of the week."
>she says that to you as if it was casual work-place talk
>she realizes instantly from your wide-eyed look that she shouldn't have said that to a male co-worker
>"I-I have to get back to work...! Yeah, that."
>you look at the clock in the locker room
>26 minutes past shift end
>her eyes follow yours and she instantly understands
>"Oh, you can have double-time for those"
>you look at her, giving her 'the look'
>"F-Fine, the whole last hour"
>she's still trying to return her underwear back into underwear, not overwear
>"Should I report this to Ms. Hoshimachi?"
>that makes her react like a deer in headlights
>"Could you turn around, Anon? I need to..."
>oh shit
>you turn around
>you hear a low, womanly moan
>followed by a dual sound; fwoosh of fabric, clank of metal
>some shuffling, A-chan huffing
>The sound of fabric and metal again but in reverse
>"You can turn around now, Anon"
>you do so
>"I'll give you... overtime for the whole day, just don't..."
>she trails off as she stuffs something deep into the trash can
>"I appreciate it. Thank you."
>you got what you wanted and all it took was a thinly-veiled threat and your boss's sore ass
>A-chan nods and walks - waddles really- away
>but you can see her ass crack peeking out between her low-ride jeans and her riding-up shirt
>what happened to her-?
>oh fuck
>the moment the door closes on the locker room, you sprint to the trash can
>yep, the fear of Suisei made A-chan do exactly what you thought she would never ever do
>at the bottom of the trash is those familiar strawberries
>you know there's no camera in the locker room
>you reach in, grabbing the still-warm garment
>'A-chan' on the waistband greets you again
>you snatch them out of the trash like a goddamn raccoon, stuffing them in your pocket
>maybe today was a good day after all
