##### `Temporary Werewolf trip`
==(Part 1)==
>be (you) going on a surprise trip organised by your wifewolf
>don’t know where you’re going but she says you’ll like it
>arrive at some lodge and head inside and find yourself greeted by another werewolf
>find out your at some werewolf getaway thing, which is weird considering you aren’t one
>get told not to worry as you’ll fit in soon enough
>that was weird like the bunch of waivers you had to sign
>you were handed a bottle by your wife, her saying it was an energy drink or something
>you downed it in one go, feeling bizarrely thirsty all of a sudden
>soon after you felt..fuzzy, a feeling that lasted the whole day
>then night fell and the moon came out
>suddenly hear a small *rip* from the ground
>looking down you see…claws poking out the front of your shoes?
>wat?
>look at your wife and she’s practically beaming at you with her tail wagging heavily behind her
>she suggests you might want to take the rest of your clothes off
>confused and concerned you follow her advice.
>suddenly you feel immense pain all over your body and fall to your knees, buckling over
>you see your arms being covered in thick dark fur before you close you’re eyes in pain
>after a minute the excruciating pain suddenly disappears completely
>you look up from the ground, seeing your wife has an arm out to help you up, her tail swinging even faster
>you hold up your arm to grab hers recoiling when a massive claw comes into view
>realise it’s your own hand and that you are a werewolf now?
>your wife pulls you to your feet but you immediately fall over again
>she wanted to spend the night running through the woods with you
>instead she has to spend it teaching you how to walk and talk properly on account of your new digitigrade legs and razor-sharp teeth filled maw

>the first thing she did was teach you how to speak again
>turns out trying to speak with a completely different size, shape and length tongue aswell as a different shaped mouth is difficult, who would’ve guessed?
>your wife giggled at the incoherent nonsense you tried to speak with at first
>you flipped her off playfully, finding your padded and clawed hand was still just as flexible
>she told you go keep your tongue in a position where it wouldn’t catch on your sharp teeth
>even though she said if you did it would heal pretty quick now
>eventually you could speak, mostly, without sounding like you had a severe speech impediment
>then came the difficult task of balancing and walking on completely different legs with a different centre of gravity
>She pulled you to your feet and put herself under your shoulder
>to your surprise you were taller than her now
>she kept you upright as you hobbled along, learning how to use your new tail to help balance yourself
>eventually she let go of you and you managed to walk a bit without help
>your wife remarked how it was like watching a baby take its first steps
>you growled at her- wait growled?
>she laughed and you covered your face embarrassed
>it took a little while but you were able to walk just fine
>then your wife took off, running on all fours
>despite the fact she was a hundred meters away before she spoke you heard her just fine as she said you had to catch her
>running on all fours after barely getting the hang of walking on two feet was weird but at this point what wasn’t?
>you threw caution to the wind and ran after her, stumbling a few times but in pursuit none-the-less

>running on all fours came naturally, almost as if you were supposed to
>despite the fact is was the dead of night you could see just fine, focusing on your wife ahead of you
>she was fast, but so were you.
>you’d run with her before when you were a human, or rather you ran and she kept up with a jog, outpacing you easily
>but now you were gaining on her, her lead slowly wearing away
>when you were 20 feet from her she suddenly stopped, back to you stood up
>you went to tackle her on instinct throwing your arms up to grab her
>suddenly she ducked, your arms went high, then she rotated herself to grap your waist, and tripped your leg up
>you fell into the dirt, crumpling as she performed a reverse tackle
>you tried to get up immediately but felt her pin you to the ground
>then your felt her teeth at your throat, pressing hard enough to sting but not enough to pierce your skin
>you froze as fear ran through your body
>had you done something wrong?
>then she lapped at your neck with her tongue, releasing you
>she sat up laughing, while you were still led on the floor
>”you should have seen your face” she said in between laughs
>you tried to get up but she pushed you back down again, leaning downwards until she was inches from your face
>”listen mister, you might be bigger than me now, but I’M still in charge. Got it?”
>you nodded
>”good boy” she said before kissing you

>after kissing you she looked down and her tail started wagging agin
>looking down you saw what she had, you were sporting a hard on with a dick much larger than usual
>”For me puppy?” She said coyly
>she gently grasped it in her hand, before lining it up with her furred slit
>you put your hands on her hips and pulled her downwards onto your cock
>you both howled at the sensation
>you bucked into her again and again, groaning at the feeling
>her hands were on your chest and they tensed, her claws cutting into you
>bizarrely you felt a mix of pain and pleasure from it
>your own hands went from her waist to her huge boobs, fondling them aggressively and she moaned
>soon you both came, another howl duet coming from the two of you
>you were still panting as you recovered when you felt a claw under your chin, bringing your attention back to her
>”ready for round 2 puppy?”
>you would spend the night mating with your wife in the woods under the blessing of the moon

>you woke up the next morning naked and in the middle of the woods with your wife spooning you from behind
>apparently even when you were bigger than her last night she still wanted to be the (little) big spoon
>then you disappointingly realised you were human again as you held up a claw and furless hand
>from behind your wife grabbed your hand in her own, pulling it close to your chest
>”don’t worry you’ll turn again tonight in the moon” she said yawning
>you felt excited at the prospect
>then her hand made its way towards your crotch
>”that doesn’t mean we can’t have some fun in the meantime though” she whispered, gently nibbling your ear
==(Part 2)==
>Be (you) going on a not-so-surprise trip with your wifewolf.
>after last month’s trip she was more than eager to go again with you.
>you pull up to the lodge like last time and enter, finding it a little busier than last time.
>probably because it’s October and well, Halloween and all.
>Sign all the waivers and stuff before you’re handed the bottle full of werewolf potion? Juice? Whatever the fuck it’s called
>you drink it and the fuzzy feeling you felt last time returns
>there’s a few hours until sundown so you’ve got some time to kill
>your wife is busy talking to the receptionist so you decide to look around
>say hi to a couple werewolves while walking around before you hear what sounds like arguing from around a corner

>You peek your head around the corner and see a tall grey werewolf talking to a shortish human woman
>although it wasn’t really talking it was more like berating if you were honest
>the werewolf was a man judging by his harsh voice
>he was pointing and almost shouting things at the poor woman who looked like she was about to die of fright
>you stepped around the corner and walked towards them to intervene but it was too late
>the woman said something back that the werewolf clearly didn’t like as he shoved her and she fell over backwards, cowering away from him
>this pissed you off and sped up towards them
>”Hey!” You shouted as you drew close
>the werewolf turned around and looked down at you laughing as he saw you
>”Awww what are you gonna do little guy?” He sneered, pushing you to the ground
>he jeered as he turned back to the woman
>you angrily got up and grabbed his shoulder, pulling him to face you again
>he was halfway through insulting you when he looked up at you and his ears flattened against his head
>”H-h-hey man I didn’t mean anything!” He fearfully said, scooting around you and running down the hall away from you
>uhhh, ok?
>you went over to the poor woman who was still on the floor and held out and arm to help her up
>however both of you recoiled as you saw your arm was covered in dark fur and ended in a hand with man shredding claws

>wat?
>you looked at the rest of yourself
>you had transformed into a werewolf…but it wasn’t even beginning to get dark yet
>the hell?
>the tried to step back but your body suddenly remembered it had a different centre of gravity and different legs so you almost fell over
>you quickly tried to remember how your wife had taught you to move around and talk
>after a few tries it came back to you and you steadied yourself again and held out you hand to the lady
>she took it and pulled herself up, thanking you for that and scaring the guy off
>you told her not to worry about it and told her to stay safe before you headed back towards your wife
>you realised you were taller than the werewolves you had said hello to earlier as you walked past them and stood behind your wife
>she turned around and looked up at you, her tail wagging for a second before she asked what the hell happened to you
>you explained the past few minutes to her and she said that you getting angry probably triggered your transformation
>apparently the werewolf drink had a slight problem with that
>however your wife suddenly looked down and behind you and you felt something bump into your tail.

>you turned around and saw the woman from before, she barely came up to your navel and was sheepishly looking like she wanted to say something.
>it took a few seconds but she eventually worked up the courage to ask if she could join you, later tonight.
>you told her she would have to ask ‘her’, pointing over your shoulder with your thumb and stepping out the way
>your wife stepped forward and bent over, examining the woman, who looked absolutely terrified
>”Got a name?” Your wife asked
>”L-Lana” the woman replied
>”Well Lana, you may join us, but don’t get any funny ideas”
>your wife stood back up and turned back to the receptionist, saying something about another person in your party
>Lana looked happy now as she looked around the room waiting, however you saw her sneak a few glances at the ‘package’ in what was left of your pants

>The rest of the day was spent walking through the woods and getting to know Lana
>turns out she was a human like you who wanted to experience what it was like to be a werewolf
>however shortly after consuming the werewolf ‘potion’ that werewolf from before had started berating her on being a human and ‘fake wolf’
>of course then you appeared and you know the rest
>your wife seemed to get along with Lana but was a bit possessive of you if Lana got a bit close to you
>eventually the sun set and soon the moon came out
>Lana asked you something but you were distracted by the sudden appearance of fangs in her mouth as well as her arms becoming hairy
>there was a *riip* and you saw claws had torn through the front of her shoes
>your wife to quickly tell Lana to remove her clothing if she wanted to have something to wear tomorrow but Lana didn’t want to as she was self-conscious
>which meant she was still fully clothed when her transformation started proper
>Lana buckled but didn’t fall over yet, her arms were already covered in hazel fur
>she quickly started to get bigger, causing her poor clothes to tear apart
>Lana’s shirt fell apart and you got a good look at her now massive boobs
>you glanced at your wife expecting her to be scowling at you but instead she was focused on Lana
>pretty soon Lana had finished her transformation and was looking right at you with a hunger in her eyes
>she tried to run at you but fell straight over because of the whole legs, tail and centre of gravity
