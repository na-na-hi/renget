##Appearance
Zelus stands approximately 181cm tall. His hair is vibrant green in color, reaches down to his back and is usually kept loose or tied up. Aside from the hair on his head, eyebrows and eyelashes no other traces of hair can be found on his body. 

His eyes are similarly green and have a gentle look about them. Out on the sides his ears are completely normal. His nose is small and feminine. Even further down his chest is completely flat. Down some more his butt is deliciously gropeable. In general his build is quite slender and svelte, aside from his genitals it leans more towards a feminine look. His skin is unremarkably fair. Muscle-wise, not much is visible.

In terms of clothing they can usually be found wearing light and loose dresses or a silken two piece. Though through [Transmog] are also capable of showcasing quite the collection of costumes.

##Attitude
Loud, proud and very showy. Enjoys being the center of attention.
Doesn't actually want to hurt anyone, would much rather play cards while robbing people
Has a practiced merchant's smile, which he liberally shows off

##Plans
Gather Fame & Fortune
Support his family & friends
Create & expand his own fleet
Make Asriphel richer

##Thoughts
Faceclaim might not seem pirate-y enough, but I feel that adds to the charm

##Profile
[EOH Name]
Zelus

[One line description]
Swashbuckler, Summoner and Captain in search of fame & fortune

[Personality]
Adventurous rogue who enjoys sailing the seas of Ballad and beyond almost as much as he
enjoys sampling it's many pleasantries. Not averse to a spot of privateering to earn his 
coin, continuing the local traditions of robbing people blind while wearing a smile.

Holds a sincere love for his hometown and it's inhabitants, regularly sends money home
to finance both his family and the neighborhood he grew up in.

Has a peculiar fighting style involving showy moves and spectacle, though he prefers 
not having to fight at all as it tires him out quite quickly. Is cheered on through-
out battle by his familiar.

[Backstory]
Born in the city of Asriphel as the son of a shipwright and a barmaid, Zelus did not
have a particularly grand future ahead of him aside from a stable job earned by
apprenticing and learning his father's trade (or, considering his looks, his mother's.) 

However, Zelus himself was of a different mind and applied himself to joining one of 
Asriphel's merchant navies, working his way up from the bottom through a combination of
skill, a bit of planning and more than a few greased palms.

Now in command of his very own vessel, Zelus looks forwards to the horizons of Ballad,
in search of fame and fortune.
