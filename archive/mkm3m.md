You're lying in your crib, late at night. It's way past your bedtime. Mommy tucked you in and kissed you goodnight hours ago. You should be fast asleep, but tonight's no ordinary night.

The pitter-patter of rain against your window grew louder and louder as the night went on. The loud, scary booms in the distance have grown closer and closer. You don't know what's happening. You're scared. Scared and confused.

You lay there, swaddled in your special blankie and nightcap mommy made just for you. You're so warm, but you're still shivering from fright. You try to focus on the spinning lights of your mobile, but your eyes are tearing up. You whimper softly to yourself. You're so afraid of what's outside, but you don't want to wake up mommy. She works so hard and does so much to make you happy. You need to be a strong sapling and try to go to sleep. You have to-

Suddenly a bright light flashes! For an instant the room goes white, blinding your tiny little eyes. You gasp in shock! But then-!

*BOOOOOOOOOOM!!!*

"UUUUUU!!! UUUUUUUUUUUUU!!!"

You can't help it! You need mommy! Where's Fau-Fau! You need her! Where is she!?

You roll back and forth in your bed, futilely trying to get away from whatever scary monster made that noise! Your blankie slips off of you. Tears stream down your face. You miss Fauna!

The door opens. A voice softly whispers into the room.

"Hey! Who's crying in here?"

Your roll over onto your side to see who's there.

It's mommy! Her green hair tumbles over her shoulders in a curly mess. Her pink pajamas are all wrinkled, and her nightcap sits askew on her head. She's rubbing sleep from her eyes. You woke her up...

But she's smiling. Fauna walks over to your crib, reaching inside to wipe the tears from your face. Mommy's touch soothes your terror, but you're still quivering in fright.

"There there, little guy. It's all okay. Mommy's here."

You press your cheek up against mommy's hand for comfort. Your cries have softened into quiet sobbing. You look up into Fauna's big, loving eyes.

"Did you get scared by the storm?" she giggles. "It's alright. It's just some lightning. Everything's going to be okay."

You struggle to understand her words, but the calming tone of her voice has you slightly relax. But it was so loud! So bright! What if it happens again-

*BOOOOOOM*

"UUUUUUUUUUUUUU!"

Another flash! Another loud noise! You press yourself against mommy's hand for protection, stifling the urge to start crying again. It's no use. You can already feel the tears coming back. Mommy gives you an exaggerated pout.

"Oh... Okay, little sapling. Come here."

Fauna scoops you up out of your crib and brings you close. You bury your face in her pajamas, muffling your fearful whimpering.

"Let's go to mommy's room. I know just the trick to make everything feel all better!"


Fauna switches on the light, bathing her room in a warm glow. You're happy to be out of the dark, at least, but you can't stop shaking in terror even with mommy holding you tight. She gently rubs your head as she sits at the edge of her bed, where she lifts you up to take a better look at you. You're fighting back tears. Fauna smiles.

"Are you hungry?"

The question gives you pause for a moment. Why would she feed you so late at night? Fauna giggles when she sees your confusion.

Gently lowering you onto her lap, she pulls up her pajamas to reveal her bare chest. The prospect of feeding would normally excite you, but you're too scared. She lifts you up, drawing you towards her breast.

"Open wide!"

But you can't! Your lips are pursed in a whimper, as though opening them would let loose a torrent of despair. Undeterred, she brings you even closer, rubbing her nipple against your lip, teasing out a droplet of milk. Maybe you should-

*BOOOOOOOM!!!*

Not again! You can't help it! You cry out in terror!

"UUUUU!!! UUUUUUUUU-mmf!"

Suddenly mommy shoves her breast into your mouth! For a moment, you give a muffled whimper of protest. That's before you feel her nipple on your tongue, before you taste the first drops of milk running down your throat. Your feeble cry becomes a moan of pleasure. Instinct takes over. You begin suckling mommy's sweet, delicious milk.

"There you go! Isn't that better!"

Your eyes are still shut, tears already drying. With her nipple on your tongue, you start to squeeze with your mouth, letting it fill with milk. You gulp it down as fast as you can suckle. You weren't hungry before, but the soothing sensation of mommy's breast, the honeyed taste of her milk...

Your terrified quaking has settled into a fearful shiver. You know that you're safe with mommy... but you're still scared... Fauna caresses you, evidently feeling your worry.

"It's okay... Mommy still has a trick up her sleeve... Just sit there, relax, and drink up..." she whispers. "Mommy'll take care of the rest."

You give a curious mewl, partly opening your eyes to see what she means.

With a soft giggle, she takes off your nightcap, letting your leaves unfurl atop your head. She rests her hand against the base of your stem.

"Don't worry, my cute little sapling. Mommy'll make you feel all better."

At Fauna's reassurance, you try to focus on the calming sensation of feeding. You trust her. Mommy would never lie to you.

Your confidence is shaken as you feel mommy's hand wrap around your stem.

"uuu!" Your shock, muffled by Fauna's breast, causes her to chuckle again. What's mommy doing? She knows your sensitive there! Is she going to tickle you?

"I told you, silly little sapling, just relax." she calmly whispers. "Mommy's going to make sure all the bad feelings go away."

With slight trepidation, you close your eyes in assent and continue to suckle. The feeling of warm milk filling your belly has you at ease, even as mommy's hand begins to slowly slide up your stem towards your leaves.

"You're gonna feel... ticklish, here." Fauna says, brushing her fingers against your leaves as she grasps your stem. Sure enough, the sensation causes you to shudder. It dosen't just tickle... it feels... good. Really good. Like when you got bit by a mosquito and kept scratching the bump on tree bark, even though mommy told you not to.

Fauna waits for you to sit still, then slowly starts rubbing your stem, up and down, from the top of your head all the way up to your leaves.

"uuu!" you moan again. It feels even better! For a moment, you're distracted from feeding, but quickly return to sucking at her breast, letting more and more milk fill your mouth as mommy continues.

And she dosen't just continue. She's going faster! Rubbing your stem up and down, up and down, up and down, again, and again, and again!

"uuuu! uuuuUUUUUU!"

You're no longer crying out in fear, but in pleasure! What is mommy doing to you?

"Hehe... I knew you'd like that, my cute little sapling... We're almost there..."

She goes even faster! She even starts to fondle your leaves, even more sensitive than your stem, every time her hand comes up! The feeling of her fingers rubbing the tips of your leaves... You feel your body shaking in excitement rather than fear.

"UUUUUU! UUUUUUUUUU!"

You barely notice how your suckling even harder. Milk gushes into your mouth, almost faster than your can gulp it down. In a haze of pleasure, it somehow tastes even better than before!

"That's it... I know you can keep going... You've always been mommy's strongest sapling... Always so big and brave and cute...Sometimes you just need a gentle reminder now and then... a reminder of how much mommy loves you..."

Faster! Faster! She's rubbing your stem, she's tickling your leaves, she's filling you with milk! Faster and faster and faster!

"UUUUUU! UUUUUUUUUUUUU!!! UUUUUUUUUUUUUUU!!!"

"C'mon! Almost there! Almost-"

You feel something! Something big! Something working its way up and out of your stem!

"S-S-S-SQUEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEB!!!"

Your vision goes white! Your body spasms in ecstasy! Your mouth flies open, unlatching from mommy's breast with a loud *POP* as milk spills from your cheeks!

Your stem stands straight up! Sap shoots out of its top in thick ropes! Your leaves are shaking uncontrollably!

This is the greatest you have ever felt.

Slowly, your vision returns. You've rolled backwards in mommy's arms. You see her nipple, red, throbbing, wet with spittle, milk still dripping from her teat. You feel the milk in the back of your throat, sloshing around in your belly, and running down your lips. You realize that you're head, stem, and leaves are all covered in hot, sticky sap.

You stare up at mommy. She's beaming with pride as she wipes a streak of sap from her cheek.

"Good job! Such a strong and healthy sapling! I knew you could do it!" She lifts you up and kisses you right on your forehead.

The blissful feeling in your stem is nothing compared to the happiness you feel when mommy tells you how proud she is of you.

Mommy takes you into the bathroom, giving you a quick bath in the sink. You're too exhausted to splash and play in the water like you normally do. Even with all of this warm milk in your belly, you feel more tired than usual...

Afterwards, Fauna dries you off and carries you back to her room.

"Since you're such a brave sapling, you get to sleep with mommy tonight!~"

She gingerly sets you down on the pillow next to her, pulling up the cover to tuck you both in, when suddenly-

*BOOOOOOOOOM!*

"Eep!"

You shut your eyes tight, quivering in fear for a moment... before opening them back up. You're not afraid! You're not scared anymore!

Elated, you turn over on your pillow to see mommy's smiling face.

"I always knew you were my strongest sapling..."

She pulls you close, giving you another kiss on the head, and hold you tight for the rest of the night.

It's good to be a sapling, bros.
