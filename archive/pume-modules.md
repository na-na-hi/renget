	> The most important feature of the modern world is its unprecedented prosperity. In a pre-modern society, even if one was not poor and hungry in body or mind – as many were before the development of agriculture – there was no guarantee that you would be rich when your life ended. A few might have inherited vast estates from their parents; but these could disappear overnight due to wars or plagues (the Black Death killed more than half Europe's population).

It's not about making them feel good or giving them something they want because it makes you look better as a GM – although that can happen if your prep work really helps make sure everyone has fun and feels like part of the team. The idea here isn't to give people what they ask for so much as it's about getting them engaged with the adventure before play

> Fireheart watched his Clanmates' eyes light up as the leaves fell from the trees. He remembered the excitement of falling leaves as a kit; they made great fun to jump into and then roll around in, or to race through on a leaf-strewn path. They would be so much fun to play with in the RiverClan camp, if they were allowed to go there!

>Leopardpaw had no idea how long they'd been running, but the forest was dark now. She couldn't see a thing in front of her. There were no stars, and not even a sliver of moon to light their way. And there were so many cats behind them that she felt as if they were being chased by an army.

> 'I hope we can do this again,' Bluestar thought as she raced through the forest. 'Maybe I should ask Leafpelt to come and help me train with Mallowpaw.' She was glad her friend had been willing to take part in her training session, and she hoped it would encourage her to keep up the training.

>> The Catgirl Revolution
> In the twenty-first century, the catgirls—a new breed of household companion that combine human intelligence with animal traits such as feline grace and a playful attitude towards humans. Although they were first popularised in Japan by Akihabara electronics stores, their popularity quickly spread to other countries including America, Europe and China. The term ‘catgirl’ is also often used to describe any humanoid robot or android character who combines characteristics from animals like cats (elegant movement) and dogs (affectionate behaviour).

> The winner of this duel will be determined by skill alone: who can outwit whom? It's a matter of luck whether you survive one round or several hundred rounds with your opponent before he finally manages to defeat you. If your opponents are human beings like yourself, then you're probably doomed from the outset – unless you're lucky enough to find an ancient good example living ninja priestess sitting next to you at the table, ready to help you cheat. But what if your opponent isn't human? What if it has been programmed to play chess better than any human being ever could? Then perhaps there is hope after all...

4v - This module build on previous 'new direction' but include 1st person non-cats books - 'Percy Jackson#1' to help with the causal narration - 'Project Hail Mary' to help with scientist narration- 26 books - Cats, Cats language, Violence, Religion, Tribal mentality, Medicine, Fantasy, Supernatural, Afterlife, Science
I have test with the previous module 'new direction'. as expected - this one performed much better on the first person narration. I did this since... I mainly write in first person and all of the warriors cats content were write in 3rd person

> I'm not going to die here, but if I do you'll never see me again. So let's stop fighting and get out of this mess already.
> You know what? I think you're right. Let's go home.

> "So you want to know the distant between Thunderclan and Windclan right?"
> All right let's do some math. Let's say we have a cat that is three miles from us, and another cat that is five miles away. If I can send my message through the forest at an average of two miles per hour, how long will it take for me to get a response?
> Well, if I'm sending a letter to someone who lives in a different Clan, then they're going to be traveling just as fast as I am. So I'll need to figure out what their speed is first.
> I don't know how fast cats are moving, but I can make a guess.

>>"Where did you come from
> " The tabby cat looked up at me, and his eyes widened. "Are you a StarClan warrior?" He asked, sounding nervous. I shook my head, feeling the weight of my paws on the ground as they walked over to him.
> "No," I replied. "I'm not."
> The tabby's tail twitched back and forth nervously. "Then why are you here?"
> "I'm looking for something," I said. "Have you seen it?"

>>"Cats of all clan!
> I welcome you to the Gathering." The old tom's voice boomed through the clearing, and Firestar saw his eyes twinkle in the torchlight. "I am Whisperpaw, a medicine cat who has lived many seasons among us, and I will be your guide tonight as we discuss how best to deal with this blight on our forest."
>Firestar felt a prickle of unease at the thought of a gathering of so many cats-and he couldn't help wondering what they would talk about when there were more pressing problems facing their Clan. But he was also intrigued by the idea of meeting other Clans and finding out how things worked outside ThunderClan.
>Whisperpaw stalked across the grassy circle that had been cleared for the Gathering, stopping in front of a tall rock and lifting her tail high into the air. "Let me introduce my apprentices," she announced. "This is Cloudtail, leader of SkyClan." A black-furred warrior stepped forward from behind him. He was leaner than most warriors, but he carried himself with pride, gazing around at the assembled cats with bright green eyes.

>>Kurumuzstar leap out of the
>Kurumuzstar leap out of the underbrush. She lands on her front paws, ready to pounce. Her eyes are blazing red, and she snarls at Fallowstep. He tries to run but Kurumuzstar's tail is raised high, poised to strike. She springs forward, knocking him down with a swipe of her paw. "You're mine!"
>"No! I'm not yours!" he yells as she sinks her teeth into his shoulder. Pain shoots through his body, and he yowls in agony. He thrashes around, trying to get away from her. Her claws dig deeper into his flesh. The pain becomes unbearable, and he collapses onto the ground. His vision goes dark as darkness takes over his mind.
>A sudden breeze blows across his face. A sharp scent hits his nostrils. It smells like pine needles and sweet herbs.
