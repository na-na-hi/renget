##IRC Stuff

IRC is completely anonymous if you want it to be but you have the option to register an account if you wish to do so, if you need an local IRC client for desktop i could reccomend "Hexchat" and "IRCCloud"as thats what ive been using for the past two years now of course there are many other options so try google if you want to use something else as i can only talk for hexchat myself and im using IRCCloud on mobile:
