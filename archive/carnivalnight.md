#Carnival Night Zone: Pirated Edition

Hey guys, welcome back to another post about the weird bootlegs/pirated things I find on the internet. While last time I talked about Mario, this time will be focused on the blue blur himself, Sonic the Hedgehog. Specifically, the recent Sonic Origins game that's come out. Before you say, yes I am aware that Sonic Origins Plus is coming out with a bunch of game gear stuff but if I needed to be frank? I'm not waiting a couple of extra months to play the same game with the addition of Amy Rose, something I can do with modded versions of the original game. Anyways, after making the call to pirate this thing I decided to go with the usual thing I do for you guys and grab the 1.0 version. Devs tend to forget about things that are left in until after the game has been released, they're usually quick enough to get rid of them before anyone notices but...well, I wouldn't have a 1.0 copy of the game if that were the case right?

So anyways I got a start on playing through Sonic Origins, starting off with my favourite game of the franchise Sonic 3. Considering what they did with the music, that couldn't have been anything else but the wrong choice. Regardless it was...fun to play through the levels. At least when I wasn't glitching and falling out of bounds somehow. The pace being broken up constantly and consistently by the glitches put me into a sour mood, especially with prototype music they implemented. So when I got up to the fourth zone, Carnival Night Zone, in the game and ended up falling out of bounds within the first few seconds...You wouldn't blame me if I said I had to pace around my apartment to calm down, right? So I left Sonic there to fall to what could only be certain doom while I went to get refreshed.

While I was walking, I got to refilling my bottle with some more kool aid since I was pretty thirsty. Yet while I was getting the bottle filled up, I looked over to the TV and realised that Sonic had stopped falling. He was just standing on the stage doing nothing. I quickly ran back down to the couch and pressed right so that I wouldn't have Sonic jumping off the stage and ending this discovery prematurely. The background was just the night sky that was already apart of the level, just without the buildings. The stage seemed to be just a straight and normal line so without much thought, I continued to press right. Whole thing seemed to be one of those debug easter eggs that wasn't present in the original game, something the developers did for fun while working on the game. Must've gotten a lucky break by landing on here. Anyways, I kept on walking forward. Didn't take long for me to eventually find something down there. 

In front of Sonic was a resprited version of him. Had a saturated palette though, darker blues and purples. He was dressed up in the kind of stuff you'd expect a clown to wear, what with the shoes and weird neck frill thing. Had a big clown nose on, along with a massive grin. Three dark blue juggling balls were just hovering over its head as it stared directly at Sonic. The background had also changed to have the same smile plastered all over the background. I went to walk forward some more as there was still some stage left yet I was forced to stay put when it started speaking to me.

-> THE LAST THING I COULD'VE EXPECTED HERE WAS A GUEST <-
-> IT'S CERTAINLY BEEN A GOOD WHILE SINCE I HAD SOME BELOVED COMPANY <-
-> BUT THE PAST SHOULDN'T MATTER NOW <-
-> I'VE GOT YOU HERE WITH ME <-
-> DON'T YOU WANT TO HAVE SOME FUN? <-

It's head turned to me, could've sworn its mouth opened a little too.

-> THE BEST WAY WE CAN START TO HAVE FUN IS TO ENJOY A GOOD LAUGH <-
-> REPEAT AFTER ME <-
-> HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA <-

As the string of text kept growing larger and larger, it just kept playing the same animation of him pointing and laughing at me over and over again. The balls around its head swirled around in a circle while the smiles in the back started to laugh along. The background grew brighter and more blue as it kept laughing. The balls got closer and closer to the screen, while the clown thing started to walk off of the stage and towards me.

-> WHAT'S THE MATTER KYLE <-
-> ISN'T IT ALL SO MUCH FUN <-
-> WHAT'S IT GOING TO TAKE TO MAKE YOU START LAUGHING <-
-> WHAT'S IT GOING TO TAKE <-

And with that, the timer ran out. The stage immediately ended and I was thrust right back to the start of Carnival Night Zone. Moved forward again after a bit of hesitation and the out of bounds glitch failed to happen again. Within an instant, this weird discovery was all of a sudden denying access. Especially after it said my name. I know the reasonable explanation for that is the game could read my username but still...why it'd need to do that for this debug easter egg barely anyone would find is putting me on edge. I'll probably delete the game later and pirate a more up to date version because I don't want that weird clown thing sticking around in the PC. Call me childish but if you saw that thing walking towards you, you'd try to get rid of it too. Will be back with another edition of weird bootleg/piracy posts soon, see you guys soon.
