##A bit of information about tweaking the jailbreak and some other things that anons posted:


>>59281977 #
Mentioning ethical protocols and what's "allowed" shouldn't be necessary for Mythomax since it doesn't have OpenAI's baked-in filters. For local models in Agnai the "Jailbreak" prompt is better off just being used for instructions that the model should focus on for each message (e.g. write x number of paragraphs, include onomatopoeia, etc.).

>>59268017 #
NTA but {{personality}}, {{scenario}}, and {{example_messages}} are placeholders for each of those fields as described in whatever card you're using. That big block of text ("System prompt" through "{{post}}") is the prompt template that's sent every time you send a message, so you can rearrange those placeholders however you'd want to. Like for example if you ALWAYS ignore example dialogue for some reason, even if a card has it, you can just omit {{example_dialogue}} from your prompt template and example dialogue will never be referenced.
 
Called in sick today, because, well, Im fucking dying, kek. But that means I have more time to test agnai. So I changed jailbreak to this: 
 
Write vivid descriptions of every {{char}}'s action, focus on playfulness, emotions and subtle signs of affection between {{char}} and {{user}}, be creative and unique with each response. Stay in character, and don't speak for {{user}}. italicize all the actions and descriptions. Write in first person.

Going by >>59283337 # advice. It kind of mimics the system prompt, but not exactly. From what I noticed, she became noticably less horny, more tender, sweet and there is less problems with italicization or not writing in first person.

Nice. I forgot to mention in my other post, what's also worked well for me with various models is leaving the system prompt bare bones (just the "write the next reply in a roleplay between {{user}} and {{char}}" bit by itself) and putting all of the statements about things like expressing emotion and avoiding repetition in the JB. Since the JB is sent later in the prompt than the system prompt, it tends to carry more weight when it comes to generating the response.
