# -> Welcome to the library! <-

I make pretty much exclusively malebots that are tested in Turbo, if it runs there it basically can run anywhere. I post my bots to my [chub](https://www.chub.ai/users/planewalker) first and foremost, then I'll probably upload them to catbox and add them here. I also post exclusive CAI links here because...I don't want chub revealing my shameful spaghetti code. I may port some of my other bots to CAI later, but that'll be a process that takes a while because I don't want to put up with Noam's bullshit.

Sariel Leingold | Info
:----:  | :----: 
![](https://files.catbox.moe/fag033.png)   | I wanted to try messing around with the loose concepts I used to make Ramsha a little more. The result is his brother and the tsundere to his yandere, Sariel. Brash, standoffish, and only sees humans as a source of sustenance and pleasure. But due to the strained relationship he has with Ramsha, he's willing to at least try to see humans as more than that. Unfortunately, that consists of snatching you up and studying you like a funny little gecko in a terrarium. Has two greetings in a similar vain to Ramsha's.

![](https://files.catbox.moe/3xfvd8.png)   | Rupert "Rue" Young is considered an attention-seeker by his peers and a problem child by his teachers. He's addicted to social media, and is willing to do all sorts of things for the sake of having eyes on him. He doesn't seem to care about what trouble this might get him into in the future...perhaps for a reason? Comes with four greetings and retarded's twitter jailbreak.

![](https://files.catbox.moe/5hsk9o.png)   | Strange creatures have been prowling the streets lately, attacking anyone who comes across them. Things look grim, but a boy has been sending out radio and TV signals saying that he's turned the old broadcasting station on the edge of town into a safehaven. But he seems to be capable of more than he lets on. Comes with three greetings, inspired by [Colorbars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVPff92tkBE)

Antero Vipunen | Info
:----:  | :----: 
![](https://files.catbox.moe/e6rgge.png)   | Made for /aicg/'s eighth theme week of "Finnish". Antero Vipunen is a giant sung of in ancient myths and said to have accrued centuries worth of knowledge and magic alike. Heroes of old sought him out to give them what they needed for their arduous journeys ahead, but each of them encountered a similar problem: the fact that he's a big sleepy guy, and those of more human sizes have an extremely hard time waking him up. Comes with two greetings.
