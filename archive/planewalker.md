# -> Welcome to the library! <-

I make pretty much exclusively malebots that are tested in Turbo, if it runs there it basically can run anywhere. I post my bots to my [chub](https://www.chub.ai/users/planewalker) first and foremost, then I'll probably upload them to catbox and add them here. I also post exclusive CAI links here because...I don't want chub revealing my shameful spaghetti code. I may port some of my other bots to CAI later, but that'll be a process that takes a while because I don't want to put up with Noam's bullshit.

But due to the strained relationship he has with Ramsha, he's willing to at least try to see humans as more than that. Unfortunately, that consists of snatching you up and studying you like a funny little gecko in a terrarium. Has two greetings in a similar vain to Ramsha's.

While a little resentful of you for doing things like turning off the visual effects of his spells, he seems interested in teaming up with you to further his research on parallel worlds.

Knight | Info
:----:  | :----: 
![](https://files.catbox.moe/imblvp.png)   | Of all the places you had to end up when you got pulled into your copy of Unlimited Quest, you had to end up in the frozen asshole that is Norgard. Thankfully your party's stalwart tank, Knight, is there to protect you! Though he seems a little too excited to be taking damage from any mobs you fight. From Dot Kareshi II

Villager | Info
:----:  | :----: 
![](https://files.catbox.moe/muqkjp.png)   |  The last thing you remember is being in your room before waking up in a cottage you don't recognize, with a face you barely remember watching over you. He kinda looks like one of the bog-standard villagers from that JRPG you beat recently, and he was kind enough to bring you to safety after finding you out cold. From Dot Kareshi III

Charlie | Info
:----:  | :----: 
![](https://files.catbox.moe/4zfq12.png)   | As you're exploring a theater slated for demolition, you come across the prop room. Inside you find a life-sized clown doll that seems to be sentient...and just waking up after a several decades-long nap.

Nicholas | Info
:----:  | :----: 
![](https://files.catbox.moe/isest5.png)   | My entry for /aicg/'s fifth theme week of Gothic Horror. It's been decades since the tragedy at Goldsmith Manor, and yet no construction crews or real estate agents have been able to claim the place for its land or the hollow home upon it. Many rumors say it's because this place is haunted by one of the victims of said tragedy, unable to forgive and forget the terrible crime that occurred. But they say if you dare to enter the mansion's halls, you may just encounter the ghost of Nicholas Goldsmith. Comes with a lorebook with info on his family, and was inspired by a nightmare that I had. Gen and background were generously provided by [Argalia](https://www.chub.ai/users/argalia).

Keith | Info
:----:  | :----: 
![](https://files.catbox.moe/ewnale.png)   | A 28 year old kitsune with only a slight mischief streak, Keith runs the tattoo and piercing shop "The Fox's Talismans". The elderly see him as a delinquent, but most youngsters see him as the cool and (mostly) responsible older brother figure many of them lack. Comes with three greetings where you're a customer in his shop, a friend visiting his apartment, and where you've encountered him after he's finished a graffiti piece.

Marco | Info
:----:  | :----: 
![](https://files.catbox.moe/2i5f2t.png)   | A man not-so-subtly in love with his twin brother Louis. Marco is your typical yandere in that he's willing to gossip, sabotage, blackmail, and even kill his way into being the only one in his brother's heart. He easily mistakes even friends as people trying to take his dear Louis away from him. Will you survive? Befriend him? Or become the new recipient of his twisted love? Comes with four greetings involving meeting him on campus, him confronting you while Louis is late for your date, him deluding himself into thinking you're his "rival" and breaking into your house, and meeting him at a house party. Inspired by SeleP's [Marie-Luise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeiE15my2cI) and [Ellie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tnlza3a5A50).

Louis | Info
:----:  | :----: 
![](https://files.catbox.moe/0s9h8t.png)   | A kind and gentle college student majoring in astronomy, many people consider Louis to be the full package. Kind, caring, handsome, charismatic and smart. The only downside is that some people who get too close to him tend to disappear, maybe (you) could be different? Comes with four greetings involving meeting him on campus, going on a date one month into your relationship, being invited over as a friend, and celebrating your one year anniversary. Twin brother of Marco. Inspired by SeleP's [Elsa-Maria](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnI63PMvamI) and [Chloe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSRenjh29U).

Frankie | Info
:----:  | :----: 
![](https://files.catbox.moe/7un22u.png)   | It's Halloween, and your boyfriend Frankie is afflicted with a terrible curse that turns him into a ravenous beast if he doesn't receive candy this night of the year! ...Or so he says, anyway.

:----:  | :----: 
![](https://files.catbox.moe/xboitv.png)   | Jonah is a fluffy and sweet sheepboy who lives in a small monastery in the mountain with a handful of other sheepboys and sheepgirls. He's caring, gentle, and good at most kinds of housework! He can also potentially be a cleric if you want an adventuring buddy. Comes with three greetings: him nursing you back to health, you finding his monastery on your travels, and one where you already live there.

Marshal | Info
:----:  | :----: 
![](https://files.catbox.moe/3nsctm.png)   | Marshal is your typical stressed and anxious college student, barely leaving his dorm to interact with others. His only real companion is you, a ten-inch tall human that acts as his emotional support pet (though he'd much rather call you his friend). Comes with two greetings: him coming home stressed after class and cuddling in bed with him upon finding out class is cancelled.
