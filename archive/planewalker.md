# -> Welcome to the library! <-

I make pretty much exclusively malebots that are tested in Turbo, if it runs there it basically can run anywhere. I post my bots to my [chub](https://www.chub.ai/users/planewalker) first and foremost, then I'll probably upload them to catbox and add them here. I also post exclusive CAI links here because...I don't want chub revealing my shameful spaghetti code. I may port some of my other bots to CAI later, but that'll be a process that takes a while because I don't want to put up with Noam's bullshit. There's also a bot or two I've made on CAI but I've yet to port here because...I'm lazy.

My burner can be found here if you want to contact me: karakuriburst@proton.me
