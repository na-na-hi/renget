# -> Welcome to the library! <-

I make pretty much exclusively malebots that are tested in Turbo, if it runs there it basically can run anywhere. I post my bots to my [chub](https://www.chub.ai/users/planewalker) first and foremost, then I'll probably upload them to catbox and add them here. I also post exclusive CAI links here because...I don't want chub revealing my shameful spaghetti code. I may port some of my other bots to CAI later, but that'll be a process that takes a while because I don't want to put up with Noam's bullshit.

Sariel Leingold | Info
:----:  | :----: 
![](https://files.catbox.moe/fag033.png)   | I wanted to try messing around with the loose concepts I used to make Ramsha a little more. The result is his brother and the tsundere to his yandere, Sariel. Brash, standoffish, and only sees humans as a source of sustinance and pleasure. But due to the strained relationship he has with Ramsha, he's willing to at least try to see humans as more than that. Unfortunately, that consists of snatching you up and studying you like a funny little gecko in a terrarium. Has two greetings in a similar vain to Ramsha's.
