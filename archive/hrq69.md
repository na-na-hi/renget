So you want to play Assetto Corsa in VR?

#####Which version do I buy?
Your best bet is to grab the Ultimate Edition with all of the DLC.
DLC can be pirated if you want to save a couple bucks, but it's really not worth the hassle.
Don't pay full price, this game goes on sale all the time.

Be sure not to get the base game if you ever intend on buying the DLC, there's no option to compete the bundle.

#####General setup:
Content Manager is a much better launcher than the default one, and the free version should do everything you need.
https://assettocorsa.club/content-manager.html
Install CSP through Content Manager under Settings>Custom Shader Patch, this improves lighting and is required for some mods to function correctly.
Under Settings>Assetto Corsa>Video set "Rendering mode" to either OpenVR or Oculus Rift depending on what you're using

#####Recommended Tweaks
Under Settings>Assetto Corsa>Video, uncheck the box for Sunrays since they don't work well in VR
Under Settings>Assetto Corsa>Controls, bind buttons for "Teleport to pits" and "Reset camera in VR"
Under Settings>Assetto Corsa>Windscreen FX, check the box for "Remove dirt completely" to clean your windshield
Under Settings>Assetto Corsa>View & UI, lets you set Units to Imperial if you prefer that
The Sol mod allows for improved weather and night driving

#####If you want to use your VR controllers as a wheel:

A few regulars still use this, it's not as good as a real wheel with FFB, but it's better than a controller.

#####Extra tweaks:
Race department has a list of recommended tweaks you can look at as well, but a lot of these come down to personal taste.
