Royal Marriage by anonymous

>Be a prince of royal anthro descent, your lupine ancestors ruling the kingdom for generations
>A large part of maintaining the dynasty involved foreign negotiations with the neighboring lands
>One such kingdom, ruled by the humans, lived just South of your own
>Their territory covered many important trade routes vital to your country's economy, meaning discussion among them was frequent and of upmost importance
>Your princely duties involved tagging along to these seminars, much to your dismay
>To escape boredom, you found yourself sneaking away to explore the foreign land
>As you wander around the human castle, admiring their cultural displays, you end up in a courtyard of sorts
>You take your time appreciating the vibrant flora and their scents, until your nose catches whiff of a new smell
>Following it leads you a flowering tree, behind it the hint of someone's silhouette
>You quietly peek past it to satisfy your curiosity, your eyes falling upon a young human boy distracted by a thick, leather-bound book
>A fair complexion accented with bright blue eyes, his face curtained by long sandy-blonde hair that drooped over his fine garments, elegantly draping along his physique from head-to-toe
>As you were busy gazing at him, your mind wandered away from concealing your presence, alerting him to the canine figure creeping behind him, his shock frightening you as well
> You apologize for the informality, and correctly introduce yourself
>You prod at what he's reading, sending him into a flurried lecture about botany and flowering plants, which shamefully, you were only half-paying attention, too focused on hiding your staring
>You eventually come to your senses, realizing you'd snuck off for far too long
>Before you leave, you ask for his name in case you may run into him again
>When his introduction was prefixed by "prince," your felt your heart sank into your stomach, where it remained for the duration of the visit
>Guess you would run into again
>Throughout the years, your visits to the human kingdom increased, as did your meetings with their young prince
>The times you were able to spend with him were more than worth the hours of tedious political debate
>You two grew close to each other, learning about one another’s interests, navigating around the cultural differences, eventually becoming best of friends
>Your parents’ were well aware, and strongly supported to bond between the future heirs
>To them, it was nothing but a promising alliance of foreign nations, but your friendship grew to be so much more than that; for once you had a true companion equal to you
>Even when separated, the two of you maintained conversation via letter, including various gits and trinkets from each other’s nations, which you kept meticulously organized within your room
>This friendship would maintain itself throughout your childhood
>As you grew older, developing from a young pup into an adult wolf, you underwent the obvious changes of adolescence
>You developed a taller, more muscular frame, with thickened grey and white fur reaching much longer, and pearly white teeth gleaming within your handsome snout, a spitting image of royalty
>Yet as your human friend grew alongside you, what you saw was not the transformation of a future king, but a young boy flowering into the most beautiful man you had ever seen
>His indescribably smooth skin was shaped around faint, lean musculature, sculpted on a figure that remained tiny enough for your hands to encompass, with silky hair flowing from the prettiest of faces that you had ever seen
>You were helpless as his image invaded every dream, every fantasy, every waking thought you had
>You had yet to realize it, but your friendship had grown as well, from platonic companionship to an intimate obsession, one that you would soon realize was near impossible to control
>Your dreams grew increasingly depraved, once innocent images were corrupted into garishly lewd fantasies
>His figure, often scantily clad, if clad at all, mercilessly teased you to the point of insanity, often waking you with heavy panting and stained linens
>You struggled during personal interactions, having to hold yourself back as your eyes undressed him in front of you
>His sultry eyes and soft smile had begun to make you queasy, and you swore every “accidental” brush of his soft fingers on your fur sent fireworks through your body
>Even letters weren’t safe; you just ended up desperately sniffing for any trace of his scent, which had grown disgustingly sweeter
>Once, in a depraved mania, you had swiped one of his favorite shirts from within his wardrobe, salaciously huffing the fabric in sinful passion, until you relieved yourself onto his garment
>As clarity set in, you were mortified at what you’d done
>You realized that the perversions infesting you would never subside, and that at some point, your urges would overcome rational thought
>You forbid yourself from seeing him, and as distance between you two had grew, as his face showed hints of pain whenever you left, and letters dearly questioned your well-being, you maintained your coldness
>As time passed, you felt the consequences of your aloofness as you sunk into a depression, unable to even leave your bed as your tired eyes painfully awaited their next dream with him, the thought alone of seeing him again leaving your cheek fur soaked with tears
>Eventually, you managed to cope with your feelings, and push onward towards completing your duties as the future patriarch
>One day, as you were busy dealing with paperwork, a letter was delivered to you
>Recognizing the insignia instantly as being from the human kingdom, you felt your insides writhe a bit
>As you opened it, expecting some sort of proposal for resources, you were instead met with an invitation
>To the prince’s wedding
>You could barely finish reading the invitation; your hands were shaking too much
>In just a month, the Prince was to be married to the princess of the feline kingdom that lay just north of your territory
>For a moment, your lasting depression had subsided, and in its place was blind rage, and the artisan oak table that had existed before even your time was smashed into pieces by your fists
>The feline princess?!?! THAT stuck up WHORE was going to have her way with YOUR love?!?!
>”Was this hell?” you thought, until you realized that not even Satan himself would deliver such punishment; the hottest flames of the underworld couldn’t match the aching pain you were currently feeling
>The invitation that lay crumpled and torn across the floor was the most insulting of taunts. “Invitation,” as if; you knew better than anyone that you HAD to go, to disregard and event such as this would tarnish the reputation that your kingdom had built with its neighbors
>You were going to have to watch as some stuck-up, sandpaper-tongued prissy bitch force herself on the man your heart so terribly ached for, all while your families sponsored it with gleeful ignorance
>The next week was spent between fits of rage and pathetic sobbing as you mourned the loss of your one and only, and anything else good in the world
>The weeks after were in preparation for the wedding; tailoring your suit, rehearsing your speech, reminding yourself of what anti-feline slurs you could feign ignorance of knowing their meaning, the usual
>You found that reverting into a husk of a wolf offered the best defense against the onslaught of emotional torment you were enduring, until the fateful day arrived
>You and your family made your way down to the reception hall, where you engaged in politically correct discourse among neighboring nobility
>As you were discussing fiscal policies of entomological consumption rates with the amphibians, a figure in your peripheral drew your attention
>The world around you faded into nothing, darkness illuminated only by the young man who you had spotted in the distance
>Waves upon waves of memories flooded your brain as the human prince, your dearest, face crafted by heaven’s finest sculptors
>Those dark, thick lashes highlighting his bright blue pupils; was he wearing makeup?
>His hair so beautiful, subtle curls accentuating the shine of locks that you dreamed of stroking, tied back with lace so not to hide his angelic face
>he stood so eloquently in a suit masterfully crafted, tapered perfectly along the curves of his perfect male figure; God, that tight ass of his, you just wanted to sink your teeth in it and make him scream for d-
>You feel a hand on your shoulder; your father’s, asking if you’re alright
>You realized that you were panting, your hot breath steaming as a slight bit of drool leaked from your mouth
>You tell him you’re fine, an excuse yourself from the room; the mood was much too hostile for you to deal with at the moment
>As you try to find somewhere secluded to calm down, your eye catches the feline princess, that bitch, dressed up in the gaudiest dress you had ever seen, a smug grin plastered on her ugly face
>There’s no way in hell you can let her sully the human’s pure figure
>You find yourself a dim corridor to hid in, where you plan to relax until reception is held
>As you do so, you find a familiar scent invade your nostrils
>Your body reacts without though, ears perked up, eyes on alert, scanning the surroundings for their target
>In the dim light, you see him, the prince, resting on a loveseat near the corner of the hallway, staring into the distance with eyes not adapted to such low light
>You feel the familiar tingling of metaphorical butterflies in your stomach, your throat tightening as you realize the situation
>Your sweetheart, alone and vulnerable, practically presenting himself for your taking
>Without thought, your body moved toward him
