Jonjohnson makes a bubble popping noise with his mouth. He lounges back in the low-backed leather chair that sits behind the scuffed counter in his trader shack. The automative spring that keeps it upright - softened by the years - creaks. Then it flexes him right back into place. He tries to make the popping sound again, and it's a little more hollow sounding this time, with more bass to it. 

His older brother had always been great at this. He could have popped so loud, so sonorous, that it was like a bell singing across the valley. In those good old days, those days when they were thick as thieves, he'd use that funny little call to catch Jonjohnson's attention while leaving the Bramblehorns confused but unstartled. 

Jonjohnson tried to pop once more. There wasn't enough firmness to his trembling lip, not enough air in his catching breath. It was just a sad wet smack in the gloom of the shack. Dust drifted lazily through the shafts of sunlight coming through the nailed shutters blocking up old-world window frames. The man could see tears rising in his eyes.

There was no longer a silly call across the valley. No longer herds of Bramblehorns feeding the families here. And no brother. At least, no brother of his. That man had new Brothers now, deranged and self-s--

The door opens roughly. A masked girl comes in first, under the arm of the woman who had swung open the partially stuck door. The woman is marked by trail dust, with an axe slung at her waste and a gnarly bastard rifle on her back. The girl innocently hurries through the couple aisles in the store, stopping in front of a display of the nicer scrap that Jonjohnson had managed to hide away during the Collections.

The woman was more wary. She was clearly sizing him up, which forced him to do the same. His eyes also had to keep flicking over at the girl, just in case this was some kind of burglary ploy. It would be just his luck, with everything that's been happening. The woman jingles as she approaches, but not from the spurs that're popular fashion among certain types in these parts. She wore none. 

Jonjohnson knew that sound. Metal on metal, in pouches or pockets. He relaxes a little more. She was probably looking to pay. An actual customer? A stranger from off the road? He sits up straighter in his chair and tries to look professional. He ignores a bead of sweat going from his temple to under his chin.

"JJ General, self-owned and operated. Got provisions, sundries, and recovered materials in stock. What can I do ya for?"

The woman reaches behind her waist, making Jonjohnson tense up all over again. He can practically feel his earlobes graze his shoulders. His hand goes the half-inch it needs to under the counter to touch the metal wire that triggers the shotguns pointed through the old wood and at the place right in front of him.

The lady pauses at his furtive change in posture. She slowly raises her other hand up in a placating gesture, and brings out the other hand, holding a patched up little sack. She drops it on the countertop and it rings beautifully.

"I'd like some road-ready victuals an' whatever my Quartermaster picks out. An' I don' want whatever it is that you're fingerin' at the moment. This how all customers get greeted at JJ's?"

Jonjohnson forces himself to stand up beside his chair and place both hands flat on the countertop. He swallows hard in an effort to slow down his heart. 

"No ma'am. Apologies." He glances at the girl again. Quartermaster? Takes all kinds....

"What's got you so jumpy?"

Jonjohnson gives her a good look over again. She's armed and got a cool enough head to defuse his bad manners. She might be worth trusting. Still, if it's a trap by the Brothers, he won't go quickly.

"Can't be too careful with strangers lately. Bad tidings on the road. And if you don't mind me sayin', ma'am, you're a bit overdressed for peaceful living."

She gives him a tragic little half-smile that says far too much to him. "Suppose yer right about that. Look, I'm a trouble shooter, y'might call me. I find trouble, then I shoot it."

The girl stops collecting bits into her arms and whines through the mask, "Heli, you promised!"

"C'mon, Doc. It's good marketin'!" The woman leans on the counter and says to Jonjohnson conspiratorially, "Okay, so the shootin's metaphorical at first. I make problems go 'way an' people express their gratitude after in practical, non-metaphorical terms. Not as catchy."

Jonjohnson looks at the old blood rusting on the gruesome blade attached to the woman's rifle. The bizarre thing has tubing and gadgetry going all across it. He believes her more that trouble gets shot for real than trouble gets finished off poetically. He looks back at the patient smile, twisted by a bit of smirk, that she's pointing at him. His thoughts are drifting to other things in the low light of his quiet shack, and he realizes the Brothers could never recruit someone like *this* just to bait out discontent among their Flock.

He rubs the countertop with his hands to ground himself in the here and now. The girl puts scrap and doodads on the counter beside the woman and goes into another aisle to sort dried goods.

Jonjohnson keeps his voice quiet and hunches forward into her conspiratorial posture. Hers is a feint but his is desperately for real. "Listen close because things are this bad and I'm not doing this twice. There's a cult in the hills. They've been taking over all kinds of places in the valleys, villages, townships, squats, digs, whatever. They make slaves of people. If people fight back, they cut up kids and burn folks alive and far, far worse. I will spare you what-"

There's a sharp sound like a rock bouncing off his wall outside and he shuts up in an instant. He stares at the source of the noise like a rabbit looking at a hawk's shadow sliding across the ground. Heli casually looks the same way and watches a shape go by the slits in the shutters. Humanoid, but with narrow limbs and a bulky, brick-like head.

"Don' worry none. 's one of my boys, Oh-too." She puts a hand over his, white-knuckled as he presses hard into the wood of the counter. Jonjohnson startles a bit, but it breaks his vigil. He picks up his other hand to wipe off his neck with a shop rag.

"Break'em and you'll get gratitude all over. An' if you..." He places a firm grip on her shoulder and pulls her across the counter, hissing into her ear the way a man prays before the gallows. "*If you kill every last one of those motherfuckers I'll give you whatever you want, even if it's everything I own.*" He lets her go, his hands shaking, and immediately ditches the counter to go into the back room where his bedroom is (and the glass bottle of scotch hidden within.)

"Wait, what'v th'--" the woman starts to protest, and he waves her off.

After a few moments, she picks up her treasure pouch again. "Hirin' fee, I guess. Ready, Doc?"

## -> Saint Heli's Fire <-

Shylock twirls his tentacle arm with a sinuous grace that would be impossible for any of his companions. Around and around the crank goes, rigged up into Oh-too's wiring and recharging its battery.

Oh-too lays prone on the edge of the overlook, digitally zoomed into the cathedral-like compound further off than any of the others could hope to see. Its voice comes from its speakers at exacting volume.

"Those crazed sacks of wet protein don't have a proper rotation. But there's so many that sneaking up on them is going to be impossible."

Heli breaks open tuffnut after tuffnut with the flat back of her axe, putting the nutmeat in a pile to the side and tossing the shell bits into Shylock's vertical maw.

"Scrumptious," he burbles.

"After what we've seen'em pull jus' in th' last few days, I'm with th' shopkeeper. 's like a field of gophers. The only choice is t' go into the tunnels an' burn'em all out. Otherwise they'll jus' keep takin' folks in the night."

Lilly sorts the nutmeat into three piles, though two are much larger than the last. 

"Heli, just cuz we got to stop them doesn't mean you got to kill all those people! If we made people stop believing in the leader, it would work just as well."

"No way t' do that unless we can prove to the whole countryside he ain't divine. How're we goin' t' do that when rumors can fly faster than we could run? They'll jus' claim he bodily ascended or some sh- such, or worse, break up inta a hun'red diff'ren' lil offshoot cults and even an army of do-gooders, mean-wells, and dayjobbers couldn't root them all out. Sorry, Doc, but it has to be here, it has to be now, and it has to be a forest fire."

Shylock waits patiently for his little share as he winds up Oh-too's battery. Lilly picks sullenly through her stack, guilty in advance and unsure of any alternatives. Heli gets all of her pile into the palm of her hand and slams it into her mouth all at once. She barely chews before swallowing and talking again, in a softer tone.

"I can't geddit outta my head. Th' way they smiled in their hoods when they chained those farmers down and burned'em up. Like they were watchin' a campfire and thinkin'v happy days."

"Humans have a creativity for cruelties that no other beast can match," Oh-too adds as Shylock detaches the recharger. 

"Man is neither angel nor beast, and unhappily whoever wants to act the angel, acts the beast," recites Shylock.

"Then I ain't doin' it t' be angelic, nor beastly. We've been hired to drive them off an' they've offended me wholly so I aim t' do right by this assignment. A purely human reasonin'."

"I'll say," agrees Oh-too sardonically. "And we need to get a move on. We're going to have a chance tonight."

Heli nods firmly. "Thanks for th' good work, everyone. Let's make a big change for these hills." She glances at Lilly, who still is eating slowly and frowning. 

"An' if anyone tries to run off or surrender, I'll let'em." She gets a sigh in response, but it's at least better than the silent treatment.
