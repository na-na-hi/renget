Hey there fuckers today i’ll tell a traumatizing experience I had with Dragon Ball…

It all happened last week. I was browsing random stuff on Jewtube when I came up with several “What If” Dragon Ball videos, so I decided to watch them, which I ended up liking.

I was having a fun time with this genre of videos when I came across with a video called “What if Goku was TRAPPED and BETRAYED in the TIME CHAMBER for a DECADE?”

Before clicking on the video, I already knew what this was about. My friend warned me that these videos were absolutely horrible and never followed the logic of Dragon Ball. I mean, why would Goku’s friends and family double-cross him? He’s a good guy, he would never do something evil!

I was rather curious about this video. Most of the “What If’s” that covered this topic put Goku for thousands of years, so seeing Goku trapped only for 10 years was really strange.

Since im a dumb fuck I clicked on the video without thinking, and I was greeted by the guy making his intro. I did not care for that shit and ignored it. To my surprise, this What If was actually animated, and it was way too accurate to the Super style, which was weird since most of the times it was animated it looked like shit and it reused animations from either Z, GT or Super. Even though I despised nu-DB, I was glad to see a change for once.

It all started with Goku and Bejita… doing Fortnite duos…

Ok what the fuck? Is this some sort of joke? I knew they didn’t tend to care for canonicity in these stories, but how did Fortnite exist in the DB universe? And why were these monkeys of all people playing it?

Goku was getting multiple kills while Vegeta, being the jobber he was, kept losing his health and running from players, while he shouted several racial slurs.

“Vegeta, snap out of it, it’s just a game” said Goku, trying to calm the prince down .

“Shut up Kakarot, I told you we shouldn't have dropped together” he screamed.

While he was rage quitting, Bejita got no-scoped and he blasted the TV, making a huge hole.

“God fucking dammit, I’ll have to buy a new one, thank god we are rich as fuck!” he laughed.

The scene then changed to Capsule Corp at night. Vegeta was going to his room when he heard some moans from inside, and when he got there, he couldn’t believe it.

His rival Jobku was fucking Bulma, and he had turned into a Super Saiyan.

“YOU FUCKING NIGGER, YOU’LL PAY FOR THIS” Vegeta roared, as he turned Blue, and rammed into Goku.

Both of them were fighting, and Goku was still naked, with his dick being visible. Vegeta had bloodshot eyes and was trying to kill Goku, but he kept dodging his attacks.

They didn't realize they arrived at Kami's lookout, and suddenly an evil expression formed on Bejita.

He then flew away and Goku chased him. He kept doing this for several minutes until he got close to the Time Chamber, which he kicked Goku in and blasted the door with multiple blasts.

Goku was shocked. He got BETRAYED and TRAPPED in that place. I shat in fear as Jobku screamed in rage, trying to find an exit, but it was no use, he would live there for the rest of his life.

To my surprise, everyone celebrated when Vegeta told the news. I couldn’t believe what I was watching, it felt like a nightmare…

After that, the animation stopped and it switched to the narrator explaining the next events without Goku. This went on for an hour when it switched back to animation.

Now, it was showing the last battle between Cell Max and Gohan Beast. Gohan was about to deliver the final blow when Cell randomly exploded, sending Piccolo flying away.

Everyone was confused at this, when they looked in horror at the source…

It was Tardkurat, but he had changed. His eyes were completely black, he had an evil grin on his face, and his hair was brown with a shade of black.

“It’s been a while, hasn’t it, son?” Goku said, with a demonic voice.

“Father… I… What happened to you?” asked Gohan…

“Oh don’t you remember? I was TRAPPED and BETRAYED in that fucking chamber for so many years, but fortunately I was able to escape, and now all of you will pay!” he said, laughing like a psychopath.

Gohan was crying, as he blasted a Makankosappo at his father, but Goku grabbed it with his hands and threw it back, making Jobhan explode into guts and blood.

I was shocked by this. Goku had just killed his own son without showing any mercy…

Piccolo tried to attack from behind, but Goku made him explode by just staring at him.

Vegeta, Broly, Beerus and Whis felt a dark ki and they teleported to the source, surprised to see Goku. Beerus realized what happened so he decided to use the Hakai on Goku, but it didn’t work, and in return Goku sliced the god of destruction in half, erasing him from existence.

Everyone tried to take down the demonic saiyan, but it was no use, they all failed, as Goku began destroying the city, killing every civilian there.

He then did the unthinkable. He killed Zeno-Sama. He killed every god from every universe, and then there was nothing, only complete darkness. He looked at the screen and let a dreadful roar.

My computer then started to heat up and download multiple viruses, I got out of my room and it exploded, setting the place on fire. Suddenly something blasted the house, and luckily I survived. I managed to move out of the debris and I shat in fear.

Goku was in front of me, crying realistic blood from his eyes, as he tried to attack me, but he kept missing. I tried to throw him rocks and what was left of my house but it didn’t cause any. Then, he charged a kamehameha and I braced myself for the worst. As he blasted it, I closed my eyes, remembering every moment of my life, when I woke up and realized all was just a dream and I had gotten way too drunk last night.
