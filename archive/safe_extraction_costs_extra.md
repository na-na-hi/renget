**Bang.**

The last Egg Pawn fell to the ground; sparks showering out from the half-dozen bullet holes recently punched through it's armour plating.

"We're clear! Ashe, Faulk - get the wounded inside. Rama, go grab some more ammo boxes from storage. Everyone else, you've got a five minute break this time. There'll be more Badniks coming, so heads on a swivel people!"

Stepping down from his post on the ramshackle barricade that had been erected in an attempt to provide at least a degree of cover from Eggma'am's machines, the dark armour-clad mobian glanced around the improptu firebase that had been set up. 

It was meant to be an easy job. Get into the warzone that was Emerald City. Secure the VIPs. Extract. Simple stuff. And while the first two points had gone off without a hitch, it turns out that trying to fight your way out of a city infested with robots is harder than it sounds.

When it was realised that walking out was no longer an option, Command had told them to stay put. The less waves you make, they reasoned, the less Badniks that'll come looking for a fight.
Sadly, it seemed like nobody bothered to tell the Badniks that - and they seemed pretty happy to keep throwing themselves at the dug in Spec-Ops team with reckless abandon.

Luckily, his team were well armed and spoiling for a fight. The same couldn't be said for the grunts that were acting as the VIP's bodyguards however -  those poor bastards had been trying to defend the VIPs from robots with batons and stun-guns. While - through some stroke of luck - none of them had bought the farm, they weren't the most effective at fighting.

Still, they hadn't lost anyone yet, and Command assured them that relief was on the way. He just hoped that whoever they were sending got here before the ammunition ran out.

"*Shit! Contact! More Clankers, coming this way!*"

And they were going through it pretty damn fast.
