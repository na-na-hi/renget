# Double Donut Trouble
***
"Will you just let me finish already?" Sweetheart snapped in between labored breaths, desperate for release even though she knew her captor wouldn't relent.

"Not yet, Sweetie. Just a little longer, okay?" Though she spoke with honeyed words, Perfectheart was ruthless when it came to this, never permitting her lover to finish until the time was right.

Sweetheart whined petulantly, annoyed and yet still aroused beyond belief in spite of herself. She would be lying if she said she didn't find this to be a guilty pleasure, with emphasis on the pleasure. The feeling of being so thoroughly out of control of a situation, of surrendering her agency to another person, it was alien to her, but maybe that was why it was so thrilling.

It also helped that Perfect was so good with her hands.

She stroked Sweetheart's enlarged shaft gracefully, careful not to grip too hard or move too quickly and cause a premature ending. Lubricant in the form of copious amounts of Sweetheart's precum let her glide her hand along the length smoothly, with more of the clear fluid being coaxed out regularly due to her efforts. While one hand worked over Sweetheart's rod, the other had taken to her breast, which was ample enough to fill a handful and then some. Fingers pinched lightly at the hardened nub that tipped the mound, making Sweetheart groan in appreciation. 

Perfect was sitting behind Sweetheart, so closely that she could feel the softness of her bosom where it pressed against her back. In contrast to her own labored huffs, Perfectheart's breathing was controlled and even, and the sensation of it hitting her ear sent electrifying tingles down Sweetheart's spine.

"You're doing a good job, Sweetheart." Perfect cooed, her syrupy voice stirring a fluttery feeling in Sweetheart's chest.

"Don't patronize me, I'm just sitting here getting j-jerked off." Sweetheart replied, managing a respectable amount of snark with only the slightest waver in her voice. It took discipline to be sassy while being edged for more than twenty minutes.

"I wasn't patronizing you! I really do think you're doing well at controlling yourself. You've been a very good girl."

Sparks are set off in Sweetheart's brain at the utterance of that sentence, and with an unladylike grunt she was sent over the edge. The first shot of her orgasm came out with such force that it sailed beyond the bed. Perfectheart continued stroking while Sweetheart rode out her blissful release, coercing as much of her backed-up load out as she could.

When it was over, Sweetheart pried herself off of her partner and got to her feet in as dignified a manner as one could right after an orgasm. She eyed the stained bed sheets and carpet disdainfully; she'd have to get the Sprout Moles to wash them again. She caught Perfect's eyes from where she was still seated on the bed. She had brought her hand to her face, and was admiring the thick strings of white that stretched between her fingers.

"Seems like something got you especially excited that time."

Sweetheart pouted. "I don't know what you're talking about."

"Did you like it when I called you good girl?"

"Why don't we just go shower and not talk about it, okay!?"

Perfectheart giggled and kissed her lover on the cheek. "Sure thing, Sweetie."
