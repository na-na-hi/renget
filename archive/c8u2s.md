    To achieve and maintain a state of being truly unbound from the world, free from consequence, guilt or obligation.

The formerly weakly inherited traits of her Kitsune heritage greatly improved by the Immortal herb she consumed. Her soul scenery is a glade within an endless forest of Cherry Blossom and Peach trees with an temple dedicated to worship of her. The various soul spirits residing within it take the form of the monsters she grew up with and act the part of her priests and worshippers.

Immortal Herb

A fox spirit from the demonic wilds, no one is sure of her exact origins. All that's known is that one day a demon king emerged from nowhere and wreaked havoc upon the Orthodox and Empire(both Immortal and Martial) Lands for an age. As with all such walking disasters a hero emerged to face it, forcing an unescapable curse upon the calamity and ending the crisis. That hero has by now long ascended to the heights of Sovereigncy, yet Moriko remains cursed and seeking an escape even if her malevolence has faded with the wisdom she's since gained.

    Miscellaneous Function: Life-Bound Treasure(-15+25)
    Moriko's attempt at directly saving others despite the limitation her curse forces on her. An immaculate robe forged with a significant portion of her power. Like her it posesses such a mastery with illusions that it easily fools reality itself, allowing to protect it's wearer and those around them through either deception or simply undoing any harm done to them. As something forged with Moriko's power and bound to her this armor is solely a means of protection, it can't act to harm even those attacking it's current wearer. Moriko likes to forcefully equip this onto those mortals and cultivators she judges as sufficiently heroic as a way of blessing them to go against powers far greater than their own, she is the one fueling it so the wearer's strength doesn't matter as much as it would for other treasures.
