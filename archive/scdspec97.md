# SCDSPEC97 (trollpasta.)

I had caught wind of a new Sonic CD leak over Twitter the other day because a bunch of people I followed were talking about it. It was a version of Sonic CD's PC port dated to September of 1997 that never saw the light of day which had leaked out and was apparently taken down by SEGA which was weird since they don't usually do that. The prototype itself seemed...uninteresting to say the least. Someone said it had no visible changes, another said it had 3D special stages, upgraded from the faux 3D Mode 7 of the original game...another was schizoposting about how one of the levels turned their life into a living nightmare, not sure why I bothered reading it. Somehow, I concluded it was worth checking out, so I scoured the internet for hours trying to find a download link without much luck at all.

I decided to ask my friends if they knew anything about it. Most of them told me to avoid it but one of them actually had it downloaded and was willing to share it with me, and not much later I had "SPECSCD.zip" in my Downloads. I extracted it to my desktop and tried to open the executable, and.....yeah, it crashed every single time. It seems Windows 10 doesn't exactly work with this game, which was entirely expected. Unwilling to give up I popped open my Windows XP virtual machine and attempted to load the game using it. 

This time, it actually worked. Found out the game is supposed to be called Sonic CD Special. Neat. Wonder what's so "special" about it.

Nothing really seemed different apart from the year changing to 1997, so I just hit space.

There was an "entirely new" menu which was literally just the Visual Mode menu with different options. Nothing seemed to be implemented yet apart from the basics, which gave me an impression as to how early this was scrapped. Trying to figure out how to operate it I noticed the buttons highlighted in yellow when moused over, so I attempted to open the options menu. Didn't work. I wasn't even sure why it was there since it was in the title bar too and worked fine. In fact, nothing worked except New and Load Game. Trying to load just pops up a dialog saying "No Saved Game" so I just start a new game. The intro FMV plays, and before I know it I've begun Palmtree Panic.

There's nothing much to say here. The only enhancements I noticed were either actually good ones like the Genesis spin-dash, or confusing sidegrades like the Genesis jump sound. I collected 50 rings and hopped into the giant ring at the end of the level. Since I had heard about "3D" special stages, I wanted to see what that was all about.

Disappointing but expected to say the least, they weren't really 3D. Sure, Sonic had a 3D model now, but nothing else did. I feel like they PLANNED to have everything be 3D, but this must've been scrapped so quickly they never had time. I decided to fail just to see what would happen. Sonic looked to the screen, emotionless, as he was dragged underneath the stage. Creepy, but unfinished, expected.

Not much else worth noting past this outside of a couple of odd changes, like for example Sonic uses his "Yeah!" voice clip when passing a goal post, which gets annoying quicker than you think. I ended up getting all the Time Stones by Quartz Quadrant through purely dumb luck, managing to somehow not fail a single stage. I usually fail the last 3 all the time.

Hitting Wacky Workbench, which is...not my favorite level. Zone 1 appears fine at first, but the collision is actually horribly broken for no reason, resulting in me dying a few times, but at least I had enough extra lives to get through it. Zone 2 just started oddly, the launcher just not being there, so I walked ahead of where it would be. Getting to the end of that and dropping down, Sonic just stopped near the edge. There wasn't anything I could do, and I also noticed by this point the HUD had mostly faded out leaving only the lives counter. I wasn't expecting what happened next.

As the game's graphics glitched out it emitted an ear-piercing noise from my headphones before closing itself.
I don't think I need to explain what I can only describe as a hostile takeover of the game itself by a completely miscolored Sonic, but what caused this? I'm guessing it must be an easter egg? I spent an entire minute just sitting there trying to comprehend it before I decided to just reload the game. I really wanted to see if this had any other differences within it.

Yeah.....Fuck.

I noticed the game was calling itself "Workbench CD" which concerned me, and the title screen Sonic was either not Sonic at all or severely miscolored. I just went ahead to the menu which had nothing left. The background was just purple and there was only one option left. Play.

I oblige, what else is there to do.

![Uh oh!](https://files.catbox.moe/e5fiqu.png)

I guess I'm playing as "Workbench" now. The Zone number just had an infinity symbol so I simply assumed this was the only level left. No lives now. Most likely infinite. Not that I'm complaining.

Not much of note but the zone was just a lot harder for some reason, with weird Cat Mario-esque sneaky traps appearing out of nowhere and the layout itself seeming almost randomized. I still managed to get to the end, past the "GOAL" sign, nearing the goalpost and-

I'm back at the start. Not even a transition or anything I'm just back at the start. Willing to persist I continued, with the layout seemingly further randomized, but this time I died. Then I died again. Taken back to the start, I couldn't move "Workbench" as he turned to the screen.

![HELLO](https://files.catbox.moe/j38tcs.png)
"KILL YOURSELF, FAGGOT."
I was outright shocked, I'd heard and used that kind of language before, but I would NEVER expect to hear it in a Sonic game. Then I got curious and killed "Workbench" over and over to hear if he was going to this every single time from then on, and what he would have to say. Here's the two I managed to get since he only does it every three deaths:

"HANG YOURSELF, LITTLE FUCKWAD."
"OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH LITTTTTTTTTLLLEEEEEEEEEEEEE (My actual name, my ACTUAL fucking name, I don't know how the game knew it.) have you ever tried jumping off a BRIDGEEEEEEEEEEE! HAAAAAAW HAAAAAAAAAAAAW HAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWW!" (God, that one took a while for me to be able to keep playing.)

I got bored of this quickly and closed the game. I wanted to see if I could reset the game so I roamed through the files, registry, AppData, and deleted as much of what looked like the game's savedata as I could, but nothing worked and it was still just "Workbench CD". I decided at that point that I'd seen enough and just deleted the game.

!!! note look I can't be assed to rewrite the rest right now so I'm just gonna link to the original version of the rest, I'll get to it...maybe....I don't know.
