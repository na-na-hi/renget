# SCDSPEC97 (Feb 2024 Trollpasta) 


I woke up, got on my computer and checked the internet like any other day. A couple of people online were talking about a "new" version of Sonic CD's PC port that was leaked last night, and apparently copyright striked to hell by SEGA within hours in an unusual move, so I had to see it. A couple of them were talking about the prototype itself, and I learned details, like when it was supposed to release (1997), what it contained (mostly enhancements, apparently full 3D special stages too?), but none of them seemed to know why it was taken down, only pure speculation, since I've never seen them do that for prototypes. One of them was even schizoposting about one of the levels, I paid no attention to it. I wanted to play it. But, of course, I couldn't. No downloads. So I just sulked, since people seemed weirdly defensive around it and unwilling to share it.

One option came to mind, so I messaged my friend, who was super into this stuff like me, but didn't have a computer to try it himself. Luckily, he came in clutch, and actually had downloaded a copy of it to his phone, so I asked him to send it over! He seemed unsure at first, so I instructed him not to believe in the crap people were spouting online, and after some convincing, he sent it over. I downloaded "SPECSCD.zip" and extracted it to my desktop. Inside were simply the files for the game itself dated to 1997 as expected and a shortcut to launch it. I hadn't played Sonic CD in a while, and despite not being really the biggest fan of it was actually somewhat eager to give it a play, so without further ado, I double-clicked on the shortcut to play the game.

I didn't bother to set up a VM so I was actually happy when it opened without incident, showing SEGA's logo, and then the title screen. Sonic's face was different from the original port, reverting back to how it was in the original Sonic CD game albeit stretched a bit to fit the resolution of this version. I waited a bit, and the opening FMV played without issue, and it actually looked to be in a slightly higher quality than the original port. Getting back to the title screen, it told me to PRESS ENTER, and like a good consumer, I did. Unlike the original, instead of just bringing up a menu there, it faded out, bringing me to a "Main Menu" reminiscient of the Visual Mode menu. The menu was mouse-driven, so I clicked "Options" first...didn't work, so I just pressed New Game and hoped I didn't have to configure anything.

Starting into Palmtree Panic I had to at the start guess the keybind for jump, which was Z. Moving on, I sped through the act (Fuck whoever decided to name Acts zones and Zones rounds) and made note of any changes I saw. For instance, the horrible spindash of the original is gone, it just uses the one from Sonic 2. Good change, since I don't think anyone actually likes that one. The jump sound was also changed to the one from the Genesis games, which was a weird change, I don't think anyone actually complained about that, but I didn't mind it. Making sure to grab 50 rings beforehand, I reached the goal, and jumped into the giant Ring, expecting full disappointment from the "3D" special stages, which I hadn't seen any screenshots of prior. Like I said, the game was entirely scrubbed from the Internet, so there were only people talking about it, and no actual footage.

At least I was pleasantly surprised to see that they were actually fully 3D, everything was fully modeled out apart from the ground. Looked something like Mania's special stages, while I was expecting some dogshit like the ones from PC 3D Blast. It still controlled pretty well, so I was able to get the Time Stone. I shot my friend a message giving him thanks for giving the file to me, and decided to continue on, beating Sonic CD for...I'm not sure what time this is, I've completed it more than a few times. While I played I continued to make note of any random changes I saw, like for example Sonic saying "Yeah!" when passing a sign post. It got annoying quick, but it was neat.

The playthrough was going (mostly) well, despite Collision Chaos fucking sucking, and by the time I hit Wacky Workbench I had all of the Time Stones. I failed a few special stages, which showed Sonic getting pulled under the water when you did, which was somewhat creepy. This is when I started to notice something odd happening. The collision throughout the first Act was broken, leading me to die a few times as a result, but luckily I had gotten enough extra lives to tank it, and still managed to make it to the end of the act, even somehow with 50 rings, so I managed to take down the final Time Stone.

That was the last normal part of the game I played. Starting the second act, the launcher at the beginning was completely missing, so I just ran past where it would've been, thinking it was a bug. The act itself was also full of collision bugs, a little worse than the first, but I was more prepared and managed to get past it all. Running towards the signpost, things were going well, until...

Sonic was knocked off the stage by a miscolored clone of him coming out of nowhere on that missing launcher from before! He fell to the bottom of the screen, and his sprite was mangled into a glitchy pile before disappearing. The miscolored Sonic had touched the signpost before I did, miscoloring it in his image, before walking back in from the left of the screen and standing there wagging his finger. He continued to do that for around 5 seconds before the game closed. Not before the graphics glitched various colors and the game emitted an ear-piercing noise..

...What the FUCK was that? I spent a solid minute just trying to comprehend what was going on before deciding to just try reopening the game, cause why not, I had to complete it! I had a rare-ass prototype scrubbed off the net in my hands, I was going to see what it contained.

Before re-opening the game, I took note of the icon for starting the game changing colors, matching that miscolored Sonic I saw.

I reached the title screen, and once again, that miscolored Sonic appeared. He had purple fur, and completely blackened eyes, with dark purple pupils. His skin was yellow, and his gloves were a light blue. Based on what I saw, I assumed he would have yellow shoes too. At any rate, I assumed that was it, so I pressed enter to go back to the menu.

The background was entirely purple, and there were no options left, only one to "Play" so I clicked it.

It took me back to Wacky Workbench, with the act number replaced with an infinity symbol, which I didn't understand. The only difference I noted so far besides that was simply that I wasn't playing as Sonic anymore. I was playing as his killer, his clone with improper colors that couldn't jump as high or run as fast. The lives gauge was gone, which I assumed just meant I could die as many times as I wanted. Great! I'm gonna need that.

After 5 seconds on the in-game clock passed, "Sonic" turned to me and screamed out "You fucking suck at this game!" in a robotic voice, a lot like that of Microsoft SAM. While he did so, his eyes glowed a pulsating red color, and his pupils turned a dark green, like the alarms in the background of the level.

I could tell this was going to be very very interesting and not at all annoying. In any case, I had to finish this game, so I continued. Suddenly, spikes came out of nowhere out of the ground, hurting Sonic, and not much later, a part of the level above Sonic just came down and crushed him! This isn't supposed to happen, why the hell is the game just now deciding to pull out some Cat Mario-level bullshit???? Nonetheless, I continued on, sustained by my drive to finish this prototype, despite dying many, many, many times and getting many profanities yelled at me by Sonic's killer, who I decided to name Workbench after the level, I finally managed to make it to the goal, and... there was no goal. The level looped back on itself, and despite my shock at it happening, I decided to begrudgingly continue, noting that the layout had changed. This thing wasn't just looping, it was generating new bits and pieces of Wacky Workbench just to spite me.

Meanwhile, Workbench's insults got worse, as I heard things like "FAGGOT" "HANG YOURSELF LITTLE FUCKWAD" and "OHHHHHHHHHH LITTTLEEEEEEEEE (i'm not putting my name here, but it somehow knew my fucking name.) YOU SHOULLDDDDDDD KILLLLL YOURSELFFFFFFF! KEEEEK!!!!!!" and eventually I just had enough of it and closed the game. At this point I decided to start looking for ways to reverse this, managing to find the game's folder in AppData and deleting it. But it didn't work, it's still in that state, and now I'm lost. No matter what I deleted, I still couldn't fix it, even after worming deeply through my computer's registry and everything, deleting whatever I could relating to the game outside of the game itself, nothing.

At this point, I assumed I had seen everything I had to see in the prototype and just deleted it. However, I was still eager to play some Sonic CD, so I loaded up the 2011 version, opening it and... I stared at the title screen with a 1000-yard stare...Sonic was miscolored here, there were no menu options except "Play", the looping Wacky Workbench...it was all here...but...how? Two different versions of the game, one shouldn't affect the other, this is...inexplicable....  I decided being out of options I downloaded a copy of the original Sega CD game on the internet to just emulate it, and opened it through Gens and...Are you SHITTING ME????? IT'S HERE TOO?????? FUUUCKKKK... I was starting to feel afraid, and running out of ideas and simply, way, WAY too eager to play Sonic CD without owning a real copy of it, I backed up everything, wiped my hard disk, and re-installed Windows anew. And it didn't do jack-shit! At this point it had permeated so deep into my computer that every copy of Sonic CD I had was just entirely fucked on that PC, permanently...

I tried my best to stay calm despite the fact I was on the verge of breaking down, and instead decided to just play a different Sonic game, so I loaded up Sonic Mania, opening my save file, and...

![FUCK](https://files.catbox.moe/7bpsjv.png)

No. No... No no no no no no no no no. Fuck...why...how? How the fuck is this...why is this.. how is this happening to me? I screamed out, before catching myself because my family members were asleep, like I was going to be stuck playing this shitty level for as long as I lived, but then I remembered that I own one other platform, a phone with all the classic Sonic ports that were released on it, and....HAHAHAHAHAAHHAHAAHHAHAAHAA FUUUCK it's fucked here too, all of them are...that shouldn't even be possible, it's like all the 2D games are FUCKED.... just GONE.... so I decided to play Sonic Forces, because man it fucking SUCKS but at least it wouldn't be affected and...

No. Every level just says Wacky Workbench, and playing one of the Modern levels, I can confirm it. 3D versions of Wacky Workbench that shouldn't be possible, each of them unique, each of them looping infinitely. Every game...EVERY GAME....Even the ones that weren't Sonic that I had on Steam, VVVVVV, Half-Life, fucking Yume Nikki, they all just had a looping version of Wacky Workbench to play. EVEN FUCKING FNAF, EVEN FUCKING FNAF!!! THE OFFICE AND THE CAMERAS ALL JUST DISPLAYED WACKY WORKBENCH, ALL THE ANIMATRONICS WERE JUST HIM. WORKBENCH. FUCKED UP SONIC. HIM. 

I can't deal with this, so I sent my friend an enraged message, and when he responded in mocking disbelief, I told him to eat shit and blocked his number. Some fucking friend you were. I decided to just go to bed, hoping, desperately hoping I'd feel better in the morning.

(6 hours passed.)

Are my dreams...even worth describing? It was just me, running, dying, running through that zone over and over, I couldn't even escape it in my dreams, I woke up over and over, and I could still see it in the corner of my eyes... I turned on my computer again, having unplugged it through the night, and it didn't even bother opening a system, it just displayed Wacky Workbench, so I unplugged it and slammed the monitor into the ground. I decided to just go for a walk, maybe it would clear my head, but when I looked out the front door... Wacky Workbench. It was just then I remembered the schizophrenic ramblings I read online...they were true. He was living through what I am living through now. I can't...I can't fucking do this... I closed the door and ran into the living room, remembering that there was a loaded handgun my father kept there. Without any hesitation, I press it to my head, and pull the trigger.

And it just clicked. Nothing came out. Should I feel happy about that? Lucky I survived? I wasn't even sure anymore as I pulled out the magazine and it was only full of pictures of Workbench in his zone. In this situation, everything becoming a wacky workbench, what am I supposed to even do?

The walls began to fade, the floor along with it, the room vanishing, being transmogrified into Wacky Workbench.

As in my ears, I started to hear the music of Wacky Workbench's present fade in, I fell to the ground, crying while holding myself in the fetal position.

what am I supposed to do? even if I kill myself now, the afterlife is probably just like this, and that's if I don't respawn at this point...

it's never been more over than it is now..
