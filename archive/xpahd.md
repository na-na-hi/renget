##### `Rabbit Hunting`
I have new neighbors. Though, out here that might be a stretch of the word. It can be miles between houses. But I make it a point to know the land, who's on it, and where they go. I don't much like people, and I like them even less when they come on my land either on purpose or through ignorance.

I've come to their place to introduce myself. Really it's to literally and figuratively sniff around. I will know who they are, and if they might prove to be troublesome to have in the area. I've brought a bag of venison jerky, as is the civilized thing to do. It really just provides an excuse.

I'm sure they hear the dirtbike approach from quite a ways off. Their front door is opening even as I'm turning the engine off and dismounting. I wave in greeting to the two figures standing in the doorway. Man and woman, salt and pepper hair, in their early fifties, woman favors her right hip a bit, the man's nose has been broken more than once.

"Howdy neighbors. Mind if I come up?"

They both smile and wave me up to their porch, saying hellos. I take the bag off my back and reach in for the bag of jerky, presenting it as a housewarming gift.

We make small talk that I immediately forget. Though I make a point of remembering their names. Nancy. David. I tell them my land starts a couple miles north, where the cliffs punch out of the grassland like teeth and the pines grow thick. I linger only because I can smell a third person who hasn't made themselves known yet. Someone younger.

Just as I'm making an excuse to leave he comes into the kitchen. From the look of him, he must be their son. He is tall and thin, with pale skin, unruly long hair, his father's chin and his mother's very blue eyes. He isn't handsome as much as he's pretty. He only makes eye contact for a moment before looking away, apologizing for interrupting, and making a hasty retreat.

They tell me he is very shy. His name is Aaron.

He's a lovely little bunny. And I immediately decide to return.

It is easy to make excuses to visit their property.

I learn his habits, note what his hobbies likely are by the contents of the house. I don't approach him. I don't spook him. I just wave when I see him in his window when I come by on one of my excuses. One day when he sees me coming he disappears from his window and comes to the door to greet me.

The hook is in.

He doesn't say anything other than hello. But he stays in the room, and from the corner of my eye I can see him looking with those big eyes of his, fascinated. When I go to leave he finally speaks.

"You have red hair. Are you Irish?"

"Scottish actually."

I've been on their property night after night. Following my nose. There is a pond fed by a spring that flows out into a little creek that he likes to visit. Alone. It's thick with trees, isolated, a haven for birds and other small things. He's set up a rudimentary camp with a blind where he can sit and watch. My grin shows teeth.

The next time he visits his blind, there is a slim folio in a waterproof bag waiting for him. It's a rare thing, relating to one of favored hobbies. I'm not there to see him find it. But the next time I visit his home he looks at me differently. I give him a knowing smile.

A couple weeks later there is a small collection of sketches and figure drawings from one of his favorite artists. They are not originals, only prints. Again, I'm not there to see him find it. But the next time I visit his hair is well kept, and he's dressed differently. I comment on it, and he can't keep the color from his cheeks. But he doesn't run.

Winter is coming, and here it comes furiously and with great alacrity. I will not be able to hide my tracks, my spying will not be able to be kept secret. So I set myself to leave one last gift for him, a meticulously tailored leather jacket with a lambs wool liner and a broad fur lined hood, and matching lined gloves. It will set off his pale skin and the flush in his cheeks.

When I visit his camp I am surprised. There is a note and a tiny jewelry box inside a ziplock bag. The note reads "A gift for a gift". Inside the box there is a slim gold chain, hanging from it is a small green garnet. It would certainly compliment my eyes.

Well well well.

I visit after the first snow has fallen. It isn't deep, only a few inches, but the ground has frozen and the white isn't going anywhere for a while. The gold chain and it's stone adorn my neck. Nancy and David comment on it. I smile and watch Aaron's reflection in a glass when I tell them "Someone special got it for me." He bites his lip and there's a visible tension in his body. He wants very badly to do or say something. But whatever it is, he doesn't act on the desire.

As I'm leaving he tells his parents he's headed out to his blind for a while, but he's looking at me, not them when he says it.

The pond and the stream have frozen over solid, the absense of trees and the occasional wind revealed patch of ice under the snow being the only testament to their existence. He's wearing the jacket and the gloves. They do, in fact, set off his pale skin and the flush in his cheeks.

I approach from downwind and keep in cover.

I want to chase this rabbit. I want to run him down and grab hold of him and do viciously lewd things to his delicate body. I want to mark him. Claim him. Declare him as mine. I want to fuck him in the snow. I want to smell the terror as it engulfs his rational thought and the only instinct he has left is to run. I want to roll in that experience and ride him while the adrenaline has him caught between horror and arousal.

I break a twig underfoot, entirely on purpose. His head whips around so fast I think he'll give himself whiplash. He locks eyes with me. Those beautiful big blue eyes. And I temper those instincts. Because there's no terror, only the moment of surprise, and then pure adoration, almost like a puppy. Hell, if he had a tail it'd be wagging.

He walks towards me, around the perimeter of the pond, studiously keeping off the ice. When he gets close I throw him a lopsided smile, turn and start jogging away. Over my shoulder I say to him "Catch me if you can!"

I don't run as fast as I could, else he'd never be able to catch me. I hear him keeping pace, and I let him gain a bit at a time, leading him on a merry little chase to a particularly dense stand of trees that surround an open space that would be barely big enough for a picnic. Even with the loss of leaves and undergrowth it's a very private spot. He's only arm's length away. I "trip" and spin around, tumbling to the ground, grabbing him on my way down.

When we hit the ground he's on top of me and in my arms. The flush in his face is hot from the running, and I can feel his body heat radiating, just as I'm sure he can feel mine. He freezes up when he realizes how close our lips are. Panic at being in an absolutely unfamiliar situation writes itself clearly on his face. I grab the lapels of his jacket and pull him the final inches towards me and crush my lips into his. His lips are soft like a girl's and I'm sure I'm stealing his first kiss.

When I finally let him come up for air I've left him panting. His hot breath billows out into misty plumes in the chill air. Shock and disbelief are writ clearly on his face. Arousal, while not in his eyes, is hard inside his jeans and pressing against my thigh. I doubt he's aware of it at the moment. But I have every intention of making him aware.

His voice is soft and quavering when he finally catches his breath and speaks. "Are you even real? Am I dead, or dreaming?"

I chuckle. "Oh I'm very real Aaron. Why wouldn't I be? Have you been dreaming of me? Thinking about me the way lonely boys think about pretty women?" With the last of it I move my leg, a muscled thigh drags the fabric of my jeans against the fabric of his pants, over the pole of his arousal, forcing him to be aware of his present state.

Pure shock rules his reaction, and I release his jacket lapels as he scrambles off of me, to one side. He's stammering and trying to find an excuse or explination, covering his crotch with his hands. I'm not even hearing it, not really. I'm just amused, watching him turn redder and redder until he finally falls silent without having found a cogent way to express himself.

I roll onto my side to regard him, pin him with my eyes. He meets them, but for only a moment before looking away again. I can tell his embarassment has him desperate to leave, to hide away somewhere. But he is hooked, the thought of leaving me now is worse than the idea of enduring more of this awkward silence.

I chuckle and smile. "You know it's not a bad thing Aaron. A little flattering really. A beautiful boy like you getting all flustered and aroused by being close to me."

He mutters a rebuttal. "I'm twenty five, and men aren't beautiful."

I harumph and close the small distance between us on hands and knees, bringing my face close to his again. "You are young, and attractive. Are you ashamed of your beauty? You shouldn't be. I bought those things for you because they enhance your looks, because I like your looks, I like your beauty." I get inches closer so the only place my voice can fall is into his ear. I whisper, in a low husky voice. "I love the taste of your lips."

He doesn't respond, except to tense up. This must be absolutely alien to his experience. He has no idea what to do, and he's staying still, just hoping it will pass over and end.

No beautiful bunny. No no. Not at all.

I grasp his chin with thumb and forefinger, ever so gently and turn his head to face me. "May I taste your lips again?" He doesn't say no, doesn't shake his head, doesn't pull away.

I take his second kiss. Gently, but with ardor.

He kisses back.

I let it last as long as he wants it to.

When he breaks away he looks embarassed again, and his eyes begin to look glassy. His voice is barely audible, even to my ears. "I don't know what else to do..."

I try to be reassuring. "Hey, that's okay. You can learn. I can teach you."

Hope fills those big blue eyes, and now I can't help but give in to earlier wants. There's an edge in my voice, something he should recognize as dangerous, but doesn't. "Do you want to see something amazing Aaron? Something nobody would believe if you told them?"

He only nods his head affirmatively.

I smile, knowing I'm about to break this beautiful little bunny, this vulnerable beautiful boy who's so utterly lost in me and almost drowning in the malestrom of his own feelings. I stand, and strip for him, revealing pale muscular flesh bespeckled with freckles and a thatch of fine red hair. Naked in the snow I turn a full circle in place.

Enchanted would be the proper word to describe his state of mind.

And then I flow, like water. The feeling is unlike anything I could even begin to try and compare it to. My body changes, my senses expand, my perspective shifts, and where once a naked woman stood there is now an enormous pale wolf.

I anticipate his scream, or his silent panic, or a mad dash to escape the monster that has just revealed itself to him.

But none of that happens.

His hand reaches out. It isn't even trembling. This doesn't compute. And before I realize it, he's touching me, running fingers through the fur just behind my ears.

This feels nice, and does not compute.

And then he's wrapped his arms around my neck and buried his face in my fur. There isn't even the slightest indication of fear.

What the fuck bunny? You're supposed to run!

I growl, toss my head and bounce a bit to dislodge him. He lands on his haunches. But still there is no fear.

"I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You don't like that. I'm sorry. Please don't be mad. If you think I'm beautiful, I'm only a candle to your Sun."

I blink. That might be the corniest thing I've ever heard.

But he absolutely means it.

I'm a naked woman in the snow again, staring down at him. "You're not afraid."

"Am I supposed to be?"

"You're supposed to run like a scared little bunny. You're supposed to be chased down in the snow, drug to the ground, then pinned underneath me. Then I fuck you like a wild animal, leave you bruised and sore and elated and blissful and wanting more."

He blushes imagining the scene I've crudely painted for him. "Oh. I didn't realize." Then his shoulders slump. "Did I ruin the mood?"

An exhasperated sigh blows past my lips. He sort of did. But I'm not going to say that. "I turned into a wolf! Why aren't you scared of that?"

He shrugs. "Because I figure you're still you and you've only been nice to me?"

Fuck. I set the hook too well. I'm never going to get that full blown running for his life chase. Still, maybe this isn't a bad outcome. I squat down next to him, reach a hand out to his neck and grab him by it. I squeeze a bit and brush my cheek into his while I whisper into his ear in the lewdest manner I can muster.

"Here's the deal my Beautiful little Bunny Aaron. I'm going to make it a habit to prowl around your blind. I'm going to make sure you see me. And if you run? I'm going to chase. I'm going to pull you down to the ground with my jaws, and I'm going to pin you underneath me. Then I'm going to strip open your jeans and fuck you silly in the snow under the open sky. I'll leave you exhausted in a sex fueled endorphin and adrenalin spiked bliss, probably bruised and scratched up. And I'll even make sure you get home safe. How's that sound?"

His reply is a soft whimper, followed by an even softer "Amazing."

I steal one last kiss. "Good boy. Go home and rub one out while you think about what I'm going to do to you when you run."
