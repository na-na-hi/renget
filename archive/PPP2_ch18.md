#### Vectors and Arrays
>*“Caveat emptor!”* —Good advice

*"This chapter describes how vectors are copied and accessed through subscripting. To do that, we discuss copying in general and consider vector’s relation to the lower-level notion of arrays. We present arrays’ relation to pointers and consider the problems arising from their use. We also present the five essential operations that must be considered for every type: construction, default construction, copy construction, copy assignment, and destruction. In addition, a container needs a move constructor and a move assignment."*
