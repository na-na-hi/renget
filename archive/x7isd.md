A Shattered Soul

It has been months since the accident before the recital. Not a day goes by without Sunny being tormented for his actions that day. Mari would constantly berate Sunny whenever she had the opportunity, especially when their parents weren’t home

“Hello my worthless, psychopath brother. Hope you slept like crap last night.” Mari said in a sarcastic, happy tone. Sunny walked into her room with soulless eyes. He helped got Mari up from her bed into her wheelchair, then proceeded to move her to bathroom. 

Their parents moved Mari to the piano room and turned it into her new room so she wouldn’t constantly need help going down the stairs. However, she would still need help going upstairs to use the bathtub. Luckily, all she needed was to brush her teeth so they used the downstairs bathroom.

Sunny was in charge of taking care of Mari while their parents would be away. They haven’t got in touch with their friends for the past few months since the incident where Sunny pushed Mari down the stairs. Sunny felt like scum, knowing he basically ruined his sister’s life forever. Sunny would stand in the back of the bathroom while Mari brushed her teeth. Mari glared at Sunny from the mirror, Sunny would feel her deadly stare.

“Make sure you don’t try to attack me again, I don’t want to lose more than my legs, you little bastard” Mari hissed at Sunny. Sunny just stood there, staring at the mirror to view Mari’s glowing lips. He was captivated by her beautiful features, even if she berated him. This is probably due to the porn Sunny would watch during his free time. He learned online that sexual fantasies could help cope with the depression Sunny was facing. Any adult could easily tell how ridiculous this advice was, but Sunny was young and desperate. Desperate for happiness, desperate for feeling worth in his life.

At first it felt really good, Sunny would constantly find himself watching porn on his laptop whenever he was free of Mari’s wrath. But now, he felt more deprived than ever, the feeling of happiness was temporary. He wanted this feeling to last forever, touching himself wasn’t enough anymore to please him and help him escape this pain. Sunny’s thoughts were racing for an answer on how to get rid of this pain until he heard shouting

“Pass me the towel already you god damn brat!” Mari yelled at Sunny while he was lost in his thoughts. Sunny started to shiver out of fear and ran for the towel to hand to Mari. As Sunny was handing her the towel, Mari grabbed it and kept belittling him.

“Can’t even play simple notes on that violin we worked so hard to get him, now he can’t even listen to others properly. How could anyone love such a worthless little monster like yourself huh? WHY CAN’T YOU DO ANYTHING RIGHT YOU PIECE OF SHIT” Mari shouted with all her might as her hair fell down to cover one of her eyes. Sunny was shaking in pure terror, his hands clenching into a fist. Sunny had enough, he couldn’t take this anymore. He hated this, he hated Mari and what she has done to him…or maybe Sunny hated himself for what he did to her. Either way, he had enough of this pain, he wanted to scream instead of being screamed at.

Yet, Sunny couldn’t bring himself to do it. He loved Mari even after everything she did to him. His grip in his hand completely gave out, all strength completely drained from Sunny’s body. He just stood there, staring at the ground until he started to laugh. Mari was taken aback from this new reaction from Sunny. 

“You’re right…I’m complete evil. I ruined your life, took away everything from you. I just wanted the yelling to stop, the constant yelling about how I would mess up when playing the violin. Instead…I made it worse…hahahaha…” Sunny started to walk slowly towards Mari. “Why did you have to get in my way…why couldn’t you just leave me alone…why did you want to keep torturing me. Did you really care more about that recital than me…” Mari looked terrified, she wanted to escape but knows she’s completely under Sunny’s mercy.

“Even so…I still love you Mari, even when you would call me names or scream at me…I-I still loved you.” Sunny walked behind Mari’s wheelchair and started to move her back to her room. “S-Sunny? The kitchen is back over there.” Mari couldn’t even insult him, she was just scared at this sudden shift in emotion. They both arrived in her room, Sunny puts Mari next to her bed then stands in front of her.

“I know I’m scum…so I’m going to embrace it…I won’t hide from the truth anymore.” As Sunny declared this revelation, he forcibly throws Mari onto her bed. “Oof! What the hell, Sunny! What are yo-“ before Mari could finish, Sunny shoved his lips into hers. He grabbed both of Mari’s arms and lifted them in the air so she couldn’t resist. Sunny forced his body onto Mari so she could fall down onto the bed while he was on top of her. Mari tried to resist, but without the strength in her legs, she was completely helpless.
