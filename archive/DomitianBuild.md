### Domitian Sinfonia 

>Note:
The last scion of a fallen noble family, accomplished strategist, and wizard of the spatial and arcane variety. Possessed of a murky past and alien, incomprehensible nature—but a friendly enough fellow should one meet him.

####Background (WIP)
WIP

####The Fingers
Terminal bodies associated with the whole, occasionally possessing wholly different traits than one would expect. This is a non-exhaustive list, and as such I'll include only brief details. They are somewhat malleable, but their appearances and equipment should be expected to fall into the 

#####Domitian / Domitia
The true, first body that I grew up within, though adjusted to be entirely male in appearance and functionality. Partnered is Domitia, who is simply a more feminine representation of the generally same features but lacks male anatomy, as below.

![Appearance](https://img3.gelbooru.com/images/d0/36/d0367b184955c827716fd1ae67c44f93.png)

#####Viðarr
A body formed from the need of a body that, by design, was capable of difficult feats of physiology. Made possible by use of the Nibelung demonic dynamo. Significantly more aggressive as a result. It is distinctly heavier than other bodies relative to its size; it also seems to have more bones and fewer organs than the other bodies. It is much more like a pillar of bone and sinewy flesh than a body proper...

![Appearance](https://img3.gelbooru.com/images/0c/ed/0ced45c3d716e4cc61e6e42989818bf1.jpg)

#####Helene
The completely feminine form, constructed using Aspera and a few others as guidelines. She leans completely into the female physiology, but can change that as needed.. A touch more mischievous and inherently deceitful in personality, but she lacks true malintent. Her capabilities are far more in the way of social engineering; despite being something of a diva, her ability to talk out and through various things with a direct connection to the part of the brain responsible for emotional recognition makes her uniquely suited to this end. 

![Appearance](https://img3.gelbooru.com/images/13/3f/133f1fbd186818c5097f4ea5e9212e82.jpg)

#####Camilla aka "Milly" aka The Archivist
Another completely feminine form, though this time using fey magics as the base to form the flesh. This, similar to Helene, lacks male anatomy and possesses an entirely feminine form unless otherwise needed. Due to having a direct line to certain brain structures and neurological apparati, she has a far more academic and formalized personality, less given to flights of whimsy than either Domitian or Helene. However, the strain placed upon the connection may lead her to occasionally getting headaches during the rapid memorization, categorization, and storage of knowledge.

#####Sarkany
Created from an errant encounter with a storm devouring dragon, this form holds remarkable similarity to the dragonkin species; that is to say, the Finger came about primarily from spontaneous chance. This form is somewhat more adept in the manipulation of elements, but only just. In terms of sex, rather than being purely male or female, the body instead combines both forms in an analogue of the body of a futanari, in so far as the dragon was itself hermaphroditic.

#####Ereshkigal
An experimental Finger that straddles various lines and definitions; it is perhaps the most independent from the biological systems of the Gestalt, containing within itself only a neurological link that is necessary for it to be a Finger at all. Its systems, too, are irregular, in that it is not living, yet not undead. The cells, individually, yet live, but as a whole they are connected by only their xadera connections to the Domi Core that forms the nucleus of their nervous system. That is, the systems are dead, but the components are alive. This body, however, can metabolize blood on this exact level; while it doesn't *need* blood, it forms the most efficient way for a rather unruly metabolic system to cooperate and obtain nourishment. However, general physical cohesion is far more adaptive than normal, allowing odd feats of physiology more akin to an undead than a living person.

#####Dahlia
A simple mixture of acquired minotaur DNA with the xadera genetic backbone, Dahlia appears female for all intents and purposes. Deceptively strong, she's fairly well-rounded physically, though not as coordinated as some of the other Fingers.
