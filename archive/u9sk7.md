Sad, genuine smile. Epilogue.

Some decent time had passed since then, perhaps two or three months. Coco had graduated from Hololive, not fully specifying why. Both senpai and kouhai waved her goodbye with tributes and tears on their streams, wishing her the best of luck.

“Hehe, stop it~!” Said Towa, as you nibbled her ear in front of the mirror, modeling her new clothes. “Do you think they will like it? My new outfit, I mean…”

“Oh, they’ll love it.” You assured her.

Towa turned happily to you and was about to give you a kiss, as the doorbell rang and her blood ran cold. You went to open it, Kanata was behind it, greeting you with a loving embrace. Towa too, gave her a warm welcome out of politeness.

“This early, already?” Said Towa, trying to hide her irritation. “B-But I’m about to stream…”

“Ah, don’t worry, we won’t cause trouble.” You assured her.

An alarm set off in Towa’s room, she had to get ready for the stream.

Kanata jumped in your arms and you bridal carried her to your room as she waved Towa goodbye.

And so, began Towa’s stream.

“Konyappi~!”

*creak creak creak*

“I-I am Hololive’s 4th generation…”

*Ah, right there, Anon!*

Tears began streaming down Towa’s face, her viewers took notice of her tone and chat was filled with worried comments.

You were happy, Towa was happy.

You said you loved her, and Towa loved you.

 You were satisfied, and she was…	

Towa tried to snap herself back into her streaming mindset, as she heard more lewd noises come from your room.

So, she greeted her viewers again,

with a sad, genuine smile.
