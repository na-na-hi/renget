Rarity

Rarity sighed, biting her lip to stifle the pleasure as dozens of rainbow coloured bolts arced up her arms as she slammed her hammer down on the red hot piece of metal, sparks shooting off and into the soaking wet night. Peals of thunder crashed over head, in time with her pounding as the storm *raged* above her, the torrential rain plastering her long purple hair to her beautiful face, down her wide shoulders, defined, rippling back and large, powerful arms.

The Storm Forge surged with steam and lightning as the unique, Rainbow coloured Lightning Elemental dashed and laughed and goaded the large, beautiful blacksmith with each pound of the hammer, zipping about within the confines of the forge, twisting amongst the steam the redhot magical weapon was generating.

An explosion of sparks and another, more "natural" bolt of lightning hit the forge, showering the tall, muscular Forgesmith and she reminded herself to once more thank Twilight for the tight, white apron, made up of a stretchy, shiny and *clinging* white material that the nerdy alchemist had somehow devised.

Despite the deceptive thiness of the material, as well as how *tight* the slick material clung to her body, (the almost painted on apron outlined every inch of her cobbled abs, the totatlly of her large breasts and her needy nipples) the thing was a godsend, tied around her otherwise naked body.

There was a squeal then a long drawn out moan as the bolt hit the large metal apparatus above the forge, siphoning the lightning into the large "bowl" that housed the elemental, electrifying and "exciting" the elemental inside which *exploded* into a blinding array of prismatic colours before reforming into a crackling figure of a young, pretty woman, her face twisted in ecstasy as she presses her entire body against the metal cage of the forge.

A boiling jet of steam blasts as one of the forge's rivets pops, the scalding vapour shooting around Rarity's legs before clearing to reveal she's unharmed.

She really had to thank Spike for that one as the protective heat rune above her large, chiselled ass pulses.

Gosh, she was wracking up the debts wasn't she?

Still, she'd reward her dear Spike with another chance to "apply" the rune.

He said he didn't *need* to apply it by fucking her ass but...

Well, best to be sure in matters of safety!
