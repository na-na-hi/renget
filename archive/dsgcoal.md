## General Info
>kill all ergites  kill all ergites  kill all ergites  kill all ergites  kill all ergites  kill all ergites  kill all ergites  kill all ergites
- The game series is ancient, so don't expect too much PvE lore discussion or meta exploration. 
>kill all ergites  kill all ergites  kill all ergites  kill all ergites  kill all ergites  kill all ergites  kill all ergites  kill all ergites
- This is primarily a PC general, and we mainly do PvP. Invaderphobia is not tolerated.
>kill all ergites  kill all ergites  kill all ergites  kill all ergites  kill all ergites  kill all ergites  kill all ergites
- Most activity in the general comes through invading, or doing fight clubs. 
	- FCs are mainly done in DS3 through **undead arena at sl125** (password **/dsg/**). Invasions can be at **sl90** or **sl125 pontiff**.
  >kill all ergites  kill all ergites  kill all ergites  kill all ergites  
- People aren't owed replies, so don't get upset if someone responds without handing out a (you). No being selfish.
>kill ergite
- We love our thread personalities... but if you don't, consider adding them to your filters.

## Game Questions

- Read the relevant Pastebin or Google Doc for the game you are having trouble with. It'll probably answer your questions.
 
- Be specific as possible when asking questions, so that others know how to help you. No getting upset if you don't like the answer that you receive.
 
- If you're going to post a build, posting it through a Soulsplanner (or mugenmonkey if you're weird) screenshot is preferred. 
 
- If you want in-game help in any games, state your soul level, location, and what platform you're playing on. Beware that most users are PC players, and you'll probably be out of luck if you play on console.
