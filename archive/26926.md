#Shrunk at the convention

>Go to a convention
>Meet some guy in a fursuit also wearing one of those shady merchant costumes
>He tries to sell you some kind of "potion"
>Says its just some homemade drink he makes and that you can keep the bottle
>Eh, you were thirsty, its cheap enough and the bottle looks nice
>Pass out immediately after drinking it
>Wake up sometime later
>You seem to still be at the convention?
>You look around and notice you've been shrunk, and are in some kind of bottle
>The same potion bottle the merchant sold you
>Speaking of which, he's still close
>Sitting at his own merch booth
>A booth which you are on now
>You look around the convention
>Everyone here has fursuits now
>There were a few before but now you can't see anyone not in one
>It takes a bit before the realization hits you
>Those aren't fursuits
>You look around at the booth closet to yours
>They all have one thing in common
>They're all themed around humans
>You have been shrunk and are for sale at the human themed section of a fantasy con for anthro's

For how specific this scenario is, there's a surprisingly lot of ways this could go
Bought by

>A group of 4 friends dressed as their D&D characters
>A wolf and a weasel, clearly a lesbian couple, cosplaying a barbarian and a priestess respectively
>Another cosplay girls whose getting a lot more attention than the others and has her own cameraman, probably an influencer
>A very shy rabbit girl in a hoodie and her much more extroverted older sister cosplaying as a knight
>The cheetah security officer who is secretly geeking out on her lunch break
>A young lynx guy who is as nervous as he is excited, probably his first time
>The literal momma bear with her two kids
>The tiger man in an expensive looking suit who is the owner of the hotel that is hosting the con, was maybe a bit too excited host it (because he's secretly a geek as well)
>The otter girl reporter for an online pop culture website
>no one buy's you, and the merchant dude keeps you for himself

Scenario 1: Goth bunny

>be anon
>Still stuck in jar on convention booth table
>some anthros express passing interest but move on quickly enough
>except this bunny girl
>all black fur
>black leather clothes and lace
>red eyes staring at you intently
>says something quietly to the table guy
>about 2 seconds after the cash is out of her hand your bottle is snatched up
>shes practically jogging with you to the bathroom
>shes fiddling with the jar and something metal is being wrapped around its neck
>eventually the movement stops and you're able to stand and look around
>the bottle is half buried in some fur
>turn around to see the bathroom mirror
>goth bunny girl with huge titties has you shoved in her cleavage
>a silver chain around her neck is keeping your prison in place
>she smiles briefly and heads back out to the con floor
>just about every male that walks by catches a glance at you
>their looks of envy don't exactly make the wild ride any more comfortable
>or the growing heat
>hours go by before she heads out of the con
>direct sunlight seems like it's going to be a problem
>never mind, she shoves you even further into her cleavage
>thin rays of light coming down through the fur
>you can think you can hear her getting in a car maybe some talking
>hard to hear over her heart beating like a drum
>minutes tick by and the body heat is starting to make this uncomfortable
>more movement
>then bouncing, shes either going up stairs or deliberately trying to knock your fillings out
>a door shuts and you are fished out of the fur
>those big red eyes are inspecting you very closely now
>a knock on the door "honey, come down to dinner, you spent all day at your little convention..."
>she interrupts "I'm coming mom, just putting my stuff down"
>her eyes don't glance away from you
>hard to forget you qualify as her stuff in this scenario
>she puts you on top of a dresser and throws some bags on her bed
>shes about to head out the door but stops and glances back at you
>she leans down and says "no escaping" before getting out some electrical tape
>a few chaotic spins and the cap of your prison is more secured
>she leaves you back on the dresser, though you're significantly dizzier
>minutes tick by and you look around
>her decorating leaves little to the imagination
>black is definitely her favorite color
>black sheets, black clothes on the floor, black journal on the bed, black candles on the dresser
>she even has black wallpaper with a kind of rose print on it
>it makes some of the photos on the wall stand out though
>a very suburban looking rabbit family
>though they all have white fur
>but the oldest daughter in the photo definitely has those red eyes
>and the almost comically large chest on her small frame
>so she even dyed her fur black
>you try not to think about what an edgy teenage girl might want with a shrunken human as you wait
>dinner must be a proper affair in this household because the sun has set by the time she gets back
>she doesn't even turn on the lights
>instead she goes around setting up and lighting a truly ominous number of candles
>her bed is cleared off save for the journal and she gets you from the dresser
>sitting cross legged on her bed she takes the cap off your jar
>you're roughly shaken out into her open paw
>she grasps you more gently than you were prepared for but you don't struggle to keep from getting dropped
>"good boy, you're safe" she says
>grasping you slightly more firmly she opens the journal
>a lot of detailed crosses and symbols intermixed with very girly gel pen writing
>she gets to the last page
>a big ole pentagram with a tiny stick figure human in the center
>"I'm going to make you my familiar"
>oh geez
>she gets a safety pin from her bedside table, pops it open, and sticks the tip in a candle flame for a few seconds
>you do not like where this is headed and her grip tightens slightly as you struggle
>she makes some shushing noises as she brings back the pin
>"what's your name..." you begin to ask before getting snatched up
>she's just muttering 'holy shit' to herself and kind of freaking out a little as she holds you close to her face
>"you can really talk..." she says "uh, call me master, er, uh Mistress"
>she straightens up and with a little more confidence says "I am your Mistress and you, Amon, are my familiar"
>close enough, you're not going to argue details with "Mistress" for the time being
>"What exactly does a familiar do?" you ask
>she blinks, and its obvious she didn't intend the game to get this far
>after a brief pause she says "You will do whatever your mistress commands"
>a wide grin crosses her face and before you know what's happening she buries you into her cleavage in a hug
>she rolls back onto the bed and kicks her feet up
>"I'm a real witch with a real familiar!" she says excitedly and laughs
>a knock on the door and the voice from earlier says "Dear are you alright in there?"
>she sits back up "Yeah mom, I was just uh, reading something funny"
>"okay, get to bed we have church in the morning you know"
>"I know mom, goodnight"
>she rolls over and pulls you out onto the pillow next to her face
>she's petting you gently and it's actually pretty nice, if insanely weird
>"you're really real" she says
>having no response you lie there for a little while, after today it's a struggle to stay awake in the low light
>she gets up and starts putting out candles and moving stuff around
>she undresses without much awareness that you're still watching
>she puts on a black t-shirt and crawls back into bed
>"I want you to sleep right here next to me" she says handing you a black handkerchief as a blanket
>"okay" you say tucking yourself in
>maybe this is a weird dream and you'll wake up at home
>but something about those red eyes staring at you as you drift off to sleep make you think you're here to stay

Scenario 2: Cheetah security guard
>It is well documented in the human world how cheetahs are nowhere near as aggressive as their other jungle cat cousins
>They are skittish, nervous, have anxiety and basically experience panic attacks
>Some cheetahs in zoos have emotional support dogs to help calm them down
>Yes a cheetah needs a dog smaller then itself for emotional support to not be terrified all the time

>So in the anthro world one might wonder how a cheetah can possibly make for a good security guard?
>Thankfully it's not that big a deal for conventions, most of the attendees are younger and just need a stern "stop that" when they cause trouble
>And when there is actual trouble they can easily catch the perp and hand them over to actual cops before they can even react..... then take the rest of the day off to calm their nerves once the shock sets in
>The security guard continued to eye the convention hall
>Making eye contact for the hundredth time with the table anon was trapped on
>She started to feel sorry that nobody seemed to want that particular one
>Maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea to buy him herself
>It *was* sort of cute
>And she couldn't afford an actual pet to help calm her down
>Plus her apartment wasn't that big
>But a human would barely take up any space
>They can even talk! That surely would help, right?

>The anon however likely had no idea what cheetahs are like
>Or even if he did it would be the last thing on his mind when he saw the titanic furry giantess approach
>There was only one thing on his mind
>"Giant Cat!"
>Well, two things
>"And I am the size of a mouse!"
>Millions of scenarios of cat eating mice ran through his head
>And that's if the mice were lucky
>He recalled reading that sometimes cats play games when hunting
>Usually ending in the mouse getting tortured and maimed before being eaten
>That is if the cat even decides to eat the mouse at all instead of just leave it to die
>Cheetah comes home and thinks about the "pet" she just brought with her
>She takes a look at the little furless creature in the bottle
>She thought she would feel more calm
>Instead her nervousness shot up like a rocket when she realizes she knows nothing about humans
>"How do I take care of him?"
>"What does he even eat?"
>"Where would he live?"
>"Just what the hell do I even do now?"
>The cheetah girl is now anxious as hell over a creature that fits in the palm of her hand
>A creature that she was hoping would help calm her down instead
>The anon meanwhile has no clue about any of this
>He has not forgotten his earlier thoughts about cats and mice
>Or rather, he never stopped thinking about them
>He still thinks that the only reason she brought him home was to just eat him
>If she doesn't decide to "hunt" him instead first
>Cheetah decides that her best option would be look up stuff online to see the best way to take care of a human
>Thankfully it's all pretty simple
>Dudes can eat anything that's cooked, meaning she'll just give him less then a spoon of her food and it would be enough
>The problem was where they should be staying
>She reads the humans can be a tactical bunch and if not kept in the right enclosure or cage, could easily run away
>She looks online to buy one and discovers finds out that all the new ones are expensive
>Finds a good looking used enclosure on Facebook marketplace
>Problem is it won't arrive until tomorrow
>Decides to improvise for today and get a big tupperware container that she'll pokes hole through it's lid using a needle (she didn't want the holes to be big for him to run but didn't want him to suffocate)
>Is getting a bit more anxious as she's feeling that this was probably not a good idea whatsoever and that she won't be able to take care of the little guy
>All of which is now causing the opposite reason of why she got him in the first place
>Takes the little anon to what looks like to be her kitchen (to get the container) which causes him to be in even more dread
>He thought that she was going to eat him by just plopping him in her mouth and swallowing
>But now the possibility of him being cook dawned on him
>She's probably going to make a sandwich and put him right in the middle of it
>Or maybe she'll use him instead of a Cherry on top of some ice cream
