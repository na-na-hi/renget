>Mirra the Executioner
"A real freak, and bad luck too."
She's past being too envious of people like Mirra, still not someone she'd want to be close too. Might be expecting her to go crazy.

>Natalie
"This place is dark enough. No point livin is someone's shadow like that."
Ava's spent a good amount of time comparing herself to others when she was younger. All it did was make her bitter and more miserable than she already was. She can see why it'd happen with Dove but Natalie is just tragedy in progress in her opinion.

>Ji Jeong-Hui
"Who? Some brat? I've got better things to worry about than a dropout."
Not someone who'd immediately be on her radar. Could be a potential client for some of her businesses.

>Shiina, the Black Cat
"It's funny â€” I hear that scary kitty's pretty soft. Maybe we'd get along. It's better for the both of us we don't find out."
She'd like Shiina and find her brand cowardliness a bit refreshing, a humanizing factor in a place blood is spilt all too easily she's supposed to be one of the best at it.

>Mars Valentinus, the Scarlet Slaughter
"The type that thrives in this hellhole. Tch. Just the thought of him is giving me a headache."
A mad dog she's happy to keep her distance from. She can't really imagine a situation where she accidentally catches his attention ending well for her since he's a bit too single-minded to manipulate.
He and Ava are also pretty much complete opposites. Even with her EGO she's not very combat-focused, preferring to operate in the background with her lackeys acting as a shield. Meanwhile, everything about Mars helps him rip people apart better and he doesn't need anyone else to do that.

>Casey Jones
"A monster like that suckered someone into sticking by him...or he didn't have anywhere else to run."
Ava isn't going to be too close to any Fixer for obvious reasons, but she'll have some idea of what's going on with the freakshows around her. Enough That she'd know that getting involved Casey is a losing bet for her even if he wasn't attached to Mars.

>Alm Claude "Penumbra" Faith
"More sense than most, but damn, do I sound like that?"
Has respect for the balancing act. Thanks she'll get nailed with a color sooner or later, but might rooting for her in a way.

>Milo, Back-of-a-Van Workshop
"Useful. Buy some things from 'im now and then, but mostly have the in-house wizzes trained."
They probably have a healthy business relationship, Ava favoring him for his past circumstances and how he's risen above them. She thinks it's a shame he doesn't stick around and probably extended the offer to join The Scales more than once.

>Wilfrid, W-Corp Enforcer
"Probably thinks he's better than the rest of the corpo dogs."
Since she hopes to scoop up the Nest for herself, she probably won't get along too well with anyone from W-Corp. She might appreciate not being killed but things are likely going very wrong if she's chatting with Wilfrid.

>Azrael, X-Corp Enforcer
"Runs around like one of those cultists.."
Someone she'd keep not of but wouldn't worry about too much compared to everything else going on around her. Finds her a bit creepy.

>Haneul Vierordt, W-Corp Enforcer
"Just looking for an excuse to make a bloodbath."
Much the same as with Wilfrid. No matter how "kind" she acts, Ava won't be looking froward to a visit form an Enforcer. She won't be convinced that any meddling Hanuel does in the backstreets has anything to with doing good, even if she isn't a fan of the cannibals.
