Quality time with Omocat

>Omori had been rather confused when, upon leaving White Space and entering Neighbor’s Room, his friends were nowhere to be found
>He was even more confused when he got to the playground and none of the kids were there
>not even Boss was at his usual spot behind the fake tree; the place was completely abandoned
>abandoned… save for one person
>sitting on the picnic blanket wasn’t Mari, but someone Omori had never seen before
>Omori was bad at guessing ages, but he thought she looked like an older woman. Younger than his mom but older than Mari.
>She wore an open red coat and a green skirt. Underneath the coat she was only wearing what appeared to be a black bra, or maybe a swimsuit top? Either way, it exposed a rather generous amount of cleavage
>The woman’s minty green hair was tied up in a long braid that went down far enough to rest on the picnic blanket, and atop her head was a pair of white cat ears, which didn’t seem to be part of a costume
>Omori had seen stranger things in Headspace than a lady with cat ears, but he found them somewhat appealing regardless
>the lady just sat there, gazing up at the sky with what seemed like a look of contentment, apparently not at all perturbed by the playground’s deserted state
>Omori had stopped at the entrance to the playground and was staring at her in confusion
>she soon noticed his presence, and her face lit up with joy as she waved Omori over, as if she wasn’t a complete stranger
>after some hesitation, Omori went over to the lady and took a seat on the picnic blanket (a respectable distance away from her, of course)
>for a few moments, the woman said nothing and just looked at Omori, an odd smile on her face
>Omori, not one to back down so easily from a challenge(?), stared back at her
>an indeterminate length of time passed until the lady finally spoke

>”You’re probably wondering who I am, right?”
>Omori was indeed wondering who she was, but he remained silent
>”Well, that’s not exactly important, but just know that I’m someone you can trust. You could consider me a friend… or, I hope you do, at least.”
>Omori was a bit skeptical, but he still remained silent. He didn’t feel especially threatened by this stranger, and if he ever did, he could conjure his knife with a thought, so he wasn’t really worried
>There was another stretch of silence as Omori and the lady entered another impromptu staring contest (she was still smiling strangely), then she spoke again
>”It’s such a nice day, isn’t it? Perfect weather for cloud watching.”
>She tilted her head upward and looked at the sky again. Omori did so as well, and watched as the clouds rolled by lazily
>He had zoned out, apparently, because he hadn’t noticed the lady move over to where he was sitting and press up against him
>Omori tensed, nearly summoning his knife in a brief moment of panic, but she didn’t seem to be trying to attack him, so he willed himself to relax a bit
>Maybe she was just being friendly? This seemed a bit too intimate to be considered appropriate, though. Plus, they had just met
>”It’s a little cold, hope you don’t mind if I warm up with you.”
>There was a bt of a breeze, but it was hardly a chilly day, Omori thought. He refrained from saying anything, though, and the woman seemed to take that as an affirmative
>She shifted around behind Omori and pressed her front against his back, her sizable breasts squishing against him
>Then she wrapped her arms around Omori, clasping her hands in front of his stomach
>This was definitely too close

>They stayed like that for a couple of minutes
>Omori could feel the lady’s chest lightly rising and falling
>Maybe it was just his imagination, but he could’ve sworn she was breathing slightly harder than usual
>Suddenly, she detached from Omori and scooted backwards a bit. Omori turned around and looked at her in confusion >”It’s kinda boring around here, huh? Why don’t we play a game?”
>Omori nodded. He was getting bored, and a game did sound fun. He wondered what they could possibly play with just the two of them, though
>The woman beamed at him, then said, “Great! Alright, this game is called… Touchy-Feely…”
>Omori got the sense that she had come up with that name on the spot. He didn’t comment on it
>”It’s really easy to play: first, I touch a part of your body, then you touch a part of mine. We keep taking turns doing that until... well, until one of us wins! How does that sound?"
>Omori didn't quite understand how exactly "winning" worked in this game, but he nodded. She seemed very eager to play
>The woman grinned and clapped her hands together gleefully
>Omori thought the look on her face was almost hungry

>”Okay, let’s do it, then! I think I’ll start with… your belly.”
>Omori thought that was a weird choice, but he didn’t complain
>The lady scooted a bit closer to him and started to move her hand toward Omori’s midsection, but she hesitated before she actually touched him
>”Hey, this might be easier if you, um, lie down, you know? So I can… you know. Haha.”
>It probably would be easier, Omori thought, so he complied
>Uncurling from his usual sitting position, he lay flat on the picnic blanket
>He could still see the woman at the edge of his vision. She had a weird look on her face, like she was anticipating something, but when she saw Omori looking at her she smiled again
>”Perfect! Okay, let’s see.”
>She grabbed the bottom of Omori’s tank top and slowly brought it upward, stopping just below his chest
>Her hand went to Omori’s stomach, and she began moving it around in slow circles
>”You’re such a lean boy… must be because you’re always running around with your friends, huh? Haha.”
>His friends. Omori had nearly forgotten about them. He thought maybe he should go looking for them… but wherever they were, they could handle themselves, he was sure. He was so comfortable here that he didn’t want to move just yet. The cat lady’s gentle belly rub almost made him feel like a puppy or something
>Omori spaced out again, relaxing as the woman touched him
>Another indeterminate length of time passed, then Omori didn’t feel her hand anymore. She must’ve had her fill, then. He sat up, pulled his shirt back down, and looked at the lady. She was definitely breathing a bit harder than usual, but she was still smiling

>”Hm… okay, your turn now. I guess I’d better take this off so it doesn’t get in your way, haha.”
>She shrugged her coat off and neatly placed it next to her on the blanket, leaving her in only her black top. Then she laid down on her back like Omori had
>”Ready when you are!”
>Omori moved into position and placed a hand on her tummy, rubbing her slowly like she had done to him. The woman’s breathing got kinda funny for a moment, but she quickly calmed herself down
>”I know what you’re probably thinking: that I’m kinda chubby, right? I guess I should lay off the ramen, haha.”
>Omori hadn’t actually noticed before, but upon closer inspection, she *was* chubby. Just a bit, though. There was just enough extra flesh for him to find it appealing without straying into territory he would consider fat. He rather liked it
>”Mmm… okay! My turn again!”
>The woman sat up suddenly, surprising Omori. His turn hadn’t lasted nearly as long as her’s, or maybe it just felt that way because he had zoned out?
>”This time, I’m going to touch your chest. Can you take your shirt off for me?”
>Omori did so, and placed the clothing next to where she had put her coat. When he turned to look at the lady, that weird expression was on her face again. It was definitely something like hunger. She was staring at Omori’s bare, pale chest for a few seconds too many before she caught herself
>”Ah! I’m sorry, you’re just so… I mean, I was… um, just lie down for me, okay?”
>Omori complied

>The lady put her hand on him. She started at his stomach and slowly made her way to his chest area
>When she was nearly to his neck, she began moving her hand back down, this time lightly scraping her black nails across his body. It wasn’t anywhere near hard enough to actually hurt, but the sensation made Omori shiver
>”That feels good, huh? You like it when I do that?”
>Omori didn’t say anything, but she kept doing it, slowly bringing her hand up and then dragging her nails down his chest
>At some point, one of her fingers accidentally(?) brushed again his nipple, making him squirm a little. The woman smiled mischievously
>”You’re a sensitive little boy, aren’t you?”
>She moved her thumb around in circles around Omori’s nipple. He squirmed some more
>”Haha… I like sensitive boys…”
>The look in her eyes was borderline predatory, now. Omori somehow felt very vulnerable and strangely safe at the same time

>The lady stopped abruptly and pulled Omori up into a sitting position. He watched her chest go up and down as she breathed heavily
>”Your turn. Here, do you want me to- well, I’ll just go ahead and take it off, since I made you take off yours first! Haha…”
>She (somewhat frantically) removed her top, allowing her breasts to spill free. She didn’t lie down this time, instead choosing to remain sitting. She looked at Omori expectantly
>”Well, what are you waiting for? It’s your turn.”
>Omori brought his hand up to one of her breasts and let it hover there hesitantly
>”Hey, come on, don’t be shy about it. It’s all part of the game, yeah?”
>He supposed so, but he still wasn’t quite so sure. This had gone far beyond what could be considered a game, Omori thought
>”Here, I’ll help you out.”
>The woman took Omori’s hand and guided it to her chest. Well, if she wanted it so much, who was he to deny her?
>Omori pressed his hand in. She was big enough that he could take a whole handful. He slowly kneaded the soft, pliable flesh. It felt nice. Apparently she was enjoying it as well; her breaths were coming out as little mewls and moans
>”That’s it, you’re- hah- doing a good job! You can use both hands if you want, and don’t- ohh- don’t be afraid to get a little rough with ‘em…”
>Omori complied

>He groped her with both hands, bouncing and squishing her tits to his heart’s content. He pinched her hardened nipples and she let out a shuddering moan. Omori could’ve sworn she was drooling
>”I- ohh god. Fuck, I can’t take this anymore.”
>The woman pounced on Omori, pinning him to the picnic blanket on his back. Her breasts swayed above his face. She was blushing furiously and breathing hard. She no longer made any attempt to hide her true intentions; the look on her face was one of unbridled lust
>”Look at what you’ve done, you’ve gotten me all worked up…”
>She pawed at Omori’s shorts, trying to get them off. He lifted himself slightly so she could remove them, along with his underwear. She gripped his erection and stroked him slowly but firmly, looking into his eyes
>”You’re so hard… you want this too, don’t you?”
>She let go and pulled her skirt off, tossing it aside. Her panties had nearly been soaked through
>”You see what you’ve done to me? It should be a crime, being this cute… I could just eat you up.”

>Casting her panties aside as well, the woman aligned her entrance with Omori. She mewled as she slid herself onto his cock >”Haahh... ohh… my cute little boy…”
>She was tight and intensely warm around him. Her tits pressed against his face, and he took one into his mouth, latching onto the nipple. The woman moaned, loud and long
>The sound of flesh against flesh rang out across the empty playground as the cat woman pumped herself into Omori in a frenzy, lost in her unabashed lust for the young boy. Her expression was one of pure, manic euphoria
>Omori, for his part, continued to suckle on her breast; he was mostly just along for the ride. Every noise he made was muffled by a mouthful of boob, and the sensation of him moaning around her tit made the lady moan as well
>After a few frantic minutes of pumping herself on Omori, she howled and seized up, and the feeling of her soaking his cock with her juices drove Omori over the edge as well
>The woman ground her hips against him as they both rode out their orgasms, bodies consumed by the mind-numbing haze of pleasure for several blessed seconds

>When it was over, the cat lady seemed to regain her senses. She lifted herself off of Omori and smiled at him
>”Well, that was a fun game, wasn’t it?”
 >Omori remained silent. It had been fun, though frankly he was a bit upset that they had made such a mess of the picnic blanket
>He and the woman cleaned themselves off with a few nearby towels (Omori wasn’t actually sure where they had come from) and redressed
>There was a stretch of somewhat awkward silence as they both sat together on blanket, then she stood up
>”I’ll probably see you again… at some point, and we can play together again. How does that sound?”
>Omori nodded at her. She smiled
>”I suppose I should take my leave, then.”
>The woman walked to the entrance of the playground. She turned and waved at Omori before she left, and Omori waved back. Then she was gone
>He realized belatedly that she had never told him her name
