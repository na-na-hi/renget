#####W. Dustice
!!! info William "Billy" Dustice | HN: King Billy
	**Monkey King**: Embodies the abilities of all primates. Enhanced strength, agility, senses, and primal instinct. Has a flexible tail that can be used as a weapon.
![A young man covered in red fur with a chimpanzee head. He is wearing gloves with pipe-like metal knuckles and is bandaged in several places. ](https://img.4plebs.org/boards/tg/image/1679/77/1679772864805153.jpg)
######Background
A reserved punk from the streets of the United States who never wanted to be King. After a bloody fight in his hometown left him in trouble with the law, Billy was forced to find some way to absolve his parents of a massive debt due to his court fees. Unknowingly, Billy saved a local Pro Hero's son during that fight, earning a recommendation to an overseas hero school in Japan - a second chance to prove his worth to the world. Now arriving at his final year at Shiketsu High, Billy does his best to pass his wisdom onto younger heroes, all while learning whether or not this kind of life is worth it for one who came from nothing.

Monkey King (or just “Monkey,” though Billy thinks that name is boring) grants Billy abilities related to primate physiology. Physically, he possesses a wiry and lean body frame, with elongated arms capable of immense strength and gripping power, easily above that of a normal human. With some training, he’s been able to use his feet as a second pair of hands, grabbing onto objects and enemies while granting him an unmatched ability to climb, swing and maneuver dense environments. He has a prehensile tail about as long as a human forearm, strong enough to support his weight whilst hanging from it, and maneuverable enough to hold stuff.

Mentally, he’s still human, but with some uncanny reflexes thanks to the primate’s instinct for danger. While that helps him get out of a bad fight before it turns ugly, that instinct is also geared for aggression when provoked. More than any other hero with an animal-type mutation, Billy’s been prone to violent outbursts, “losing himself” during a fight. He’s taken to martial arts both as a physical training program and, though he’d never admit it, a mental one; to hone his mind and soul, and keep the mental aspects of his quirk in check.

Aside from all that, further training has revealed a fondness for fruit. He also gets uncomfortable whenever anyone smiles at him.

#####J. Hilt
!!! info Johanna Hilt | HN: The Gauntlet Hero, Weiss Schwarz
	**Gauntlet Manipulation**: The ability to move and manipulate a single glove or gauntlet, as well as to multiply its size enough to be capable of flattening buildings.
![A blonde girl wearing a highly feminine napoleonic military-style outfit, microskirt, and intricate, heavy, mechanized white gauntlet. She has very large blue eyes and an intense expression. ](https://img.4plebs.org/boards/tg/image/1679/78/1679788596464280.png)
######Background
Johanna was a senior student of the top hero school in Germany. Originally the extent of her quirk was believed to be only the manipulation of a single glove, so she chose the path of becoming a supporter and created the right tool for the job. Until the final year when the true extent of her quirk was discovered, unfortunately by flattening a good part of the school building. Since nobody was hurt, instead of a punishment, it was "recommended" to her to switch to a proper hero course and redo her final year as an exchange student at Shiketsu High School in Japan. 
######Stats

>Skills

>Gadget
Her gauntlet, the Hand of Fate. She made it herself and updates its design frequently, adapting its parts and creating modules for different support functions. The core function, besides being armor, is to rapidly dispense a resilient red string that is used to entangle, secure, and rope off.

#####L. Grimaldi
!!! info Lillian "Lily" Grimaldi | HN: Folly
	**Make'em Laugh**: If someone is amused by Folly, they become vulnerable to her psychic manipulation. They start to regard Folly as a dear and trusted friend and complete any requests she gives them to the best of their abilities. This hold over others runs out if they complete a Rule of Threes - three requests fulfilled, and they are automatically released.
![A girl with exceedingly long, wavy brown hair. She is dressed as a pierrot clown in a frilled unitard and blueblack beret. ](https://img.4plebs.org/boards/tg/image/1683/26/1683263311217821.jpg)
######Background
Lily's family moved to Japan in the days of chaos and have lived here for generations. She considers herself as Japanese as any other person born here, but is equally proud of her Italian ancestors. She doesn't have a mischievous streak: she is a mischievous person with a serious streak. As a young girl, she was saved in a disaster by a certain blonde up-and-coming clown hero, and in that moment she gave up on wanting to be a gymnast and decided to follow in the footsteps of her idol.

#####N. Sanchō
!!! info Naga Sanchō | HN: Sanshōgun
	**Pure Oxy**: When breathing 100% diatomic or triatomic oxygen gas, gain superhuman speed, strength, reflexes, and regeneration. The lower the oxygen content in the blood, the lower the abilities. Just below peak human abilities at STP with typical atmospheric gas mix.
![A young man in a jacket with a furred collar, wearing a gas mask with a long articulated hose. He is entirely covered, he is wielding a knife, and he is rushing out of a smoky mass. Visual glitches decorate the image. ](https://safebooru.org//samples/4016/sample_70985814c88e9736d82577ab10fe12b1604a71b8.jpg?4196825)
######Background
Growing up, the details of Naga's Quirk were unclear, but were suspected to have something to do with his abilities as a natural athlete. After coming down with a respiratory illness that say him hospitalized, his sensitivity to oxygen levels and immunity to oxygen poisoning were discovered. Naga decided to enter into a hero program so he could help in this way while he was young, and maybe retire into fire-fighting or some kind of diving work once he starts to slow down. He's a very practical guy who lives life quietly and diligently, but a different, predatory side of him comes alive in combat.

#####S. Kurama
!!! info Sōjō Kurama | HN: Tengu
	**Kotengu**: A mutant type quirk that gives the general abilities of birds of prey in a human shape. Includes the ability to fly, enhanced sight and hearing, and powerful gripping talons. Hip and chest muscles are especially powerful.
![A bird person in tailored clothing. Though they are bipedal with a determined human face, they are generally covered in fluffy eagle feathers and have black, taloned hands and feet. ](https://img.4plebs.org/boards/tg/image/1683/32/1683325640452166.jpg)
######Background
Sōjō is an idealist through and through and truly believes in things like cosmic justice, the power of friendship, and that there is always hope. He always has a platitude or a saying on hand for any situation, and sometimes talks more like an old man than the teenager he actually is. His favorite food is birdseed but he'll lie when asked and say it's something different each time, like tuna sushi, or bamboo shoots. Secretly, he's quite sensitive about his inhuman appearance, and thinks that it is better for his heart if he keeps himself at a distance from anyone outside his family.

#####J. Seishin

	**Toramimi**: A mutant quirk that gives all the abilities of the genus Panthera, including superhuman strength and speed, retractable finger claws, and a terrifying roar. The senses are so enhanced that Toramimi sometimes have trouble with overstimulation and need to work out their built up nervous energy.
![An exuberant young man with wild black and white striped hair, tiger stripes on the face, and red eye shadow. He has blue eyes, large fangs, and an ostentatious outfit. He is leaping and kicking, a long striped tail whipping behind him. ](https://safebooru.org//samples/3883/sample_7365a3f817077a1949c45202e7f8d5b756c351b5.jpg?4059541)
######Background
Part of the growing Nekommunity in modern day Japan and so prideful that at times he comes across as a mutant supremacist. He loves being a tiger-man and getting permission to get into wild, hot-blooded fights with society's blessing. He works hard, plays hard, and sleeps harder. He has transcended his delinquent past (mostly) and wants to be the unbreakable protector of his (mutant dominant) neighborhood. Ora orrra!

#####W. Gōshō
!!! info Wakate Gōshō | HN: Glint
	**Lightbender**: The power to gather and shape light. So profound is the control that even hologram illusions are possible, though simpler shapes and changes in luminosity are much less tiring to accomplish.
![A buff young man with styled black hair and luxury clothing. His gold wristwatch is twinkling brightly and golden light flows around him like falling leaves. ](https://safebooru.org//images/4005/ad83887b53bf76382e6bb7a844b5e8c0da6735e9.jpg?4185373)
######Background
All that glitters is not gold, but it does empower the Young Master's Quirk. Growing up in a life of extreme luxury, he has no idea what life is like for "commoners" and he decided to become a Hero as a hobby since his trust funds mean he'll never have to work. He does love his hobby, though, and at the end of the day people are still getting helped. The only thing better in his mind than the light he shines with is the limelight that gets pointed his way. For whatever reason, a certain laser hero is keeping a very close eye on this young man. Is it mentorship, or is it threat assessment?

#####M. Katsushi
!!! info Mio Katsushi | HN: Forget-Me-Not
	**Remote e-Viewing**: Forget-Me-Not is able to use a specialized form of clairvoyance to turn information into digital data directly. Possible sources of information are animal memories, distant viewing of real spaces, and computer systems. The information is transformed into the closest equivalent filetype, including a couple she's invented herself, and interfaces seamlessly and without buffer lag into any appropriate technology within her range. (40m for memory read/wipe/save, 100m for remote viewing.)
![A round-headed girl with a typically outlanding magical girl costume, orange-yellow hair with teal accents, a fang, and yellow cross pupils in her teal eyes. Her expression is confident and slightly demoralizing. ](https://img.4plebs.org/boards/tg/image/1683/32/1683322660402480.jpg)
######Background
Mio knows all the gossip about everyone and lots of people owe her favors. She likes to keep abreast of everyone's business and is ruthless in uncovering secrets and hidden plots. Her talent with computers is of a once-in-a-lifetime genius, but she has the personality of a boisterous and meddlesome girl instead of a comp-sec nerd. She is class 3-D's representative at Shiketsu High School, and very unpopular with those who know her beyond her cute face.

NOTE: Bluh bluh huge bitch. Bullies people just for fun, and particularly fond of blackmail. She could be the world's best digital artist and grey hat hacker, but instead she's a cunt.

#####K. Yudanoki
!!! info Kashin Yudanoki | HN: Kodoku
	**Hivemaster**: Confers the ability to command arthropods in the vicinity, as well as to generate them inside one's own body by transforming material that arthropods eat, drink, or breathe to stay alive. In an emergency, this can absolutely include one's own flesh, though this Quirk gives no enhanced ability to heal.
![A haggard young man with shaggy black hair, and unusually pale skin. He is pointing ahead and centipedes, spiders, scorpions, roaches, flies, wasps, and bees are crawling and flying from his open mouth. ](https://img.4plebs.org/boards/tg/image/1683/32/1683325808970319.jpg)
######Background
Kashin is perpetually tired and frequently ill-focused. He eats more than a normal person but hardly puts on much weight. His major hobbies are the hardcore music zine he makes about local bands, keeping up with entomology journals, and reading romance manga. Oh, and he summons bugs and stuff. He used to think that was scarier but now he's used to it.

#####U. Mendōna
!!! info Umai Mendōna | HN: Kotoba
	**Quirk Tag**: When someone with a Quirk makes physical contact with Kotoba's skin, they lose their Quirk to her and gain this Quirk with one caveat. Kotoba can reverse the trade at any time, but the other person must make skin-to-skin contact with Kotoba in order to get their original Quirk back.
![A young woman with bright red hair, yellow eyes, and a bad attitude. She is mocking the viewer. ](https://img.4plebs.org/boards/tg/image/1683/26/1683265328129533.jpg)
######Background
Umai got her start early, playing tag with the other young kids that were just developing their own Quirks. She gets a thrill out of the back and forth chase, and out of getting to experience so many other Quirks. It fed into a dominating and domineering personality as she grew up, and now edges into narcissism. To her, at least, it's all in good fun.
