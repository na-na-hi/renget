## ->The Harem Pirates<-
###  ->A Collection of AI Chat Bots from One Piece<-
[Skip to the List of Characters](https://rentry.org/AIPiece/#list-of-characters)

#### CHARACTER.AI
These chat bots were made using the website character.ai, it's website full of different characters, text-based games, terrible image generators, really anything someone wants to make with a bot. Here's their [FAQ](https://beta.character.ai/faq) page if you want to know more about it. If you don't want to be limited on the number of chats, you will need to make an account. Use a [burner email](https://generator.email/) if you don't yo use your own

The devs are pretty firm with their stance on NSFW content, most NSFW outputs will be deleted by the filters the site has in place. It is possible to dodge the filters with clever writing and euphemisms, more tips below on that.

***
#### [TAVERNAI](https://github.com/TavernAI/TavernAI)
This is a chat interface used to interact with language models. It uses node.js to host a local site that contains the chat bots which are loaded from card files. This program is unfiltered, but you must provide it with your own API key. openAI API is recommended and what these bots were built on.
->[>Prepackaged File<](https://anonfiles.com/x2cd26Zby9/The_Harem_Pirates_zip)<-

#### ->TIPS<-

!!! info
    Use parenthesis for out of character chat. This can be really useful for getting the bot to do what you want. It can be used to change story elements such as the crew name or the Captain's name. Just type something like (My name is "", I'm the captain of the "" Pirates). You can even pretend to be other characters if you let the AI know using OOC.

!!! info
    If you want to lewd but keep having trouble with the site's filters, these [tips](https://rentry.org/GreenWCaiTips) may be able to help you. Follow the guide and use a "cleaning device", I've seen good results with this method. Also, here's a nice [list of euphemisms](https://rentry.org/lewdsesaurus) to use, good luck.

!!! info
    Want characters to talk to each other? Try to look them up using the sites [room feature](https://beta.character.ai/room/create?). more tips on this below
!!! info
    Want to add a character into your Discord server? Check out [this nifty tool](https://github.com/drizzle-mizzle/CharacterAI-Discord-Bot) to do just that.

!!! info
	Syntax tips: 
	Use single asterisks \* to speak in italics. \*I walk to the bar\* will become *I walk to the bar*, this is used to narrate actions.
 	Use double asterisks \*\* to make text bold \*\*NO\*\* will become **NO**
	Use parenthesis () to use OOC chat. More on that above.

!!! info
	Use [this](greasyfork.org/en/scripts/458319) to make your italicized text darker to make things more readable.
***
#### ->HAVE BOTS INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER<-
It's possible to have bots interact with each other using the site's [room feature](https://beta.character.ai/room/create?). However there are a few things you need to do in order for the bots to show up using the search bar.
1. Follow my [profile](https://beta.character.ai/profile/?char=G8dZmyhgPaQkiIODLi880D5uDPi65hmOsMSxTcZLU1g)
2. Interact with the bot(s) you want to use at least once

You can set the scenario up however you want, that's what the bottom input box is for.
If you are looking for the Characters to interact without mentioning the Captain, I recommend using OOC to direct the scene to your liking.

#### ->Rating System<-
If you'd like more information on how training a character works, here's the [dev's page on it](https://book.character.ai/character-book/training-a-character)

Below are the available labels you can use to train the responses.
->![info on the rating system](https://i.postimg.cc/yxvwQ8RP/OOC.jpg)<-

If you just want the characters to talk to each other and not mention the captain, try to do so using the OOC feature.

## ->VOICE FILES FOR AI CLONING<-

If you want to, you can clone voices using AI with [this website](https://beta.elevenlabs.io/voice-lab).  I'm not sure how many characters I'll be able to find clean audio for, but we'll see.
These audio files were taken from One Piece: Unlimited Adventure for the Wii, only the English voices sound natural, so these are all from the dub. Obviously quality will vary, sadly it doesn't seem to do Usopp very well.

## GOALS

- [ ] Finish the side characters
- [ ] Finish the main characters
- [ ] Revise and fix definitions
- [ ] Better name for the crew
- [ ] Port characters to pygmalion/tavern AI
- [ ] Add more outfits and scenarios, Valentine, Halloween, Wedding, etc
- [ ] Normal chat options.
- [ ] Have the bots get enough interactions to publicly be used in rooms
- [ ] Add some sort of "Gameplay" mode
- [ ] Add wanted poster images to the main site

## Pygmalion

Pgymalion is a work in progress AI based off of character.ai, it has no filter in place, but being in the early stages the text coherence is a bit iffy.
I plan to port the characters over after I finish all of them on character.ai, but if you want to play around with it, [here's a guide](https://rentry.org/pygmalion-ai) and the [link to the collab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/oobabooga/AI-Notebooks/blob/main/Colab-TextGen-GPU.ipynb).

*While character.ai is shit at nsfw, it is way better at generating content pertaining to the series. I recommend dumping your logs so we can improve Pygmalion* 
[Here's the tutorial on dumping character.ai logs](https://rentry.org/chatlog-dumping)

## CHARACTER FEEDBACK

Problem with the bot's writing or personality? Fill out this [form](https://forms.gle/KhGqGfpyKAAH8Adv7) so we can work together to try and fix them.
Here's my [Character.AI Profile](https://beta.character.ai/profile/?char=G8dZmyhgPaQkiIODLi880D5uDPi65hmOsMSxTcZLU1g)
