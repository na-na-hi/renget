[raw rentry of the things said if they are blurry](https://rentry.co/ff-reply2)

1. the [second screenshot](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1063928194236944434/1075119601198841936/image.png) provided, had been taken out of context. we had said "we're afraid of confrontation, that's why we haven't said anything" in reply to "you broke up with niki because she's 17 but you like someone who's 17 ? and even if you don't like them , you're still letting them like you or letting them do  whatever it is they're doing". we're unsure why MC censored everything else but that part. the confrontation part had not been related to the pedophilia situation.

2. the first screenshot had been from our private server, which we share with close friends. we had been stressed and assuming what the other person had felt, we are not in contact with said person we had been with. multiple screenshots shared of the breakdowns we've had, that we regret what we've done in the past, learned from our mistakes and got help.

3. the point in the ticket “we couldn't wait until she was 18” we didn't see anything wrong with the relationship. that's were the original pedophilia allegations came from, was the 17/19. we lied saying this, because we did not see anything wrong with the relationship as it had been a 2-year-age gap.

4. restating from point 2, we've gotten therapy and have realized that relationship is wrong. along with this, we are bodily 19, turning 20 may 7th, and the relationship had happened 3 years ago. we say 13/14 and 16/17 because when we had gotten together, we had been 13 and 16, then shortly after turned 14 and 17 (our birthdays had been a week apart). any of the screenshots we've might've been able to gather, have since been deleted/removed as this relationship had happened over quotev. (also explained in point 2). we live in regret nearly every day from that relationship, and are disgusted in our younger selves for doing something like that.
