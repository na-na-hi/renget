**Location** - If you are not from the US, knowing which country you're in is helpful since headphone prices can vary a great deal across the world. 
 
**Budget** - We need to know how much you want to spend. If you can, please also indicate whether your budget is a hard limit, or whether it is flexible.
 
**Intended use** - What will you use them for? 
 
**Kind** - Closed-back headphones typically have louder bass, better noise isolation, less leakage, and greater dynamic range. Open-back headphones can feel more open at the expense of the aforementioned qualities. 
 
**Preferred tonal balance** - (to be filled in at a later date or perhaps never) 
 
**Preferred Music** - What do you listen to? If your music tastes are very esoteric, providing some examples (Youtube links work well) may be of some assistance. 
 
**Past headphones** - What have you used in the past, what did you like about them and what didn't you like about
 
**Source** - What are you plugging these into?
