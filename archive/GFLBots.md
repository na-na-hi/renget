//I'm open to suggestions on the greetings.  Some are sparse, and Kalina's is a bit messy.  There's also some other bots that are public but not on this list.

//These bots generally need training, but I did my best to pack them full of lore or sample dialogue that is pulled straight from the game or the wiki.

//To anyone new:  You can swipe left or right on your phone or PC (click and drag) on any response the bot gives you and rate each one for how in-character or otherwise acceptable it is.  You can also delete messages (the button is near the top right) if you want to reset things back to a certain point, say, to try a whole new set of swipes.
