Name: Toko, The Mercantile Demon

Race: [Mazoku] Don't get it twisted. I'm a true demon of Hell. The very avatar of Greed!

Sex: [Female]

Hair: [Blonde] Gold is fitting for one such as I, right?

Eyes: [Amber] [Unusual Eyes] Golden irises centered in ruby scleras, like coins in pools of blood.

Skin: [Unusual Aesthetic] Gold! Gold! Gold! Smooth, beautiful gold!

Face: [Feminine] You do love your merchant mommy, right~?

Fitness: [Buff] You get strong when you have 2 orbs of pure gold on your chest.

F.M.S.U.: [Everwet] I want it all the time. [Dick Destroyer] I want more of it. [Breeding Season] And, sometimes I want it a lot. You won't deny me. [Semen Demon] A common aspect from the Hell I come from. [Eggz] [Scrambled] [Clutch] You'll see.
G.R.M.: [Bio=Immortal] [Demon Core] [Unusual Aesthetic] [Tireless] I need a lot of energy to run my business. [Horns] [Regeneration] [Arithmonia] There are 127,983 pieces of gold in this vault. Not much, but it's useful for something. [Unusual Eyes] [Tasty Fate] [Caustic Blood] My ichor is molten, boiling gold. [Blood Overdrive] And, there's lots of it too. Many of my enemies have become glistening treasures. Many kings would be honored to have their bones dipped in pure gold, so those people should be grateful they had such a luxurious death. [Auxillary Systems] Two furnaces burn within. Extra strength is needed to move that molten metal in my veins. [Kyuu] Kyuute! [Chimera Ant - 1] Yes, those extra eyes in my horns are functional.

U.T.T.: [Prized Hen] [Eggnancy] I said you'd see. [Perfect Pussy] [Void of Corruption] Of course a demon would have this. Any self-respecting servant of Hell would! [Back Support] [Fertile Fields] [Divine Pregnancy] [Flavour Town] [Lovers Lab] [Mr Clean] [ World Clean] Any speck of dust upon my figure will not be tolerated. [Contortionist]

Player Count; [10,000 People]

Afterlife: [Mastema - Arbiter of Sanctuary] An acceptable arrangement for the boons granted...

Afterlife Timer: [1 Month]

Banes: [Mao] Evil is in a demon's nature. [Ahegao] This can even trigger when I get a massive amount of wealth from a particularly good deal. [Dere Dere] Those who give me what I want often become what I want. My own precious treasures... [Yan Yan] ...which I will not part with. [Conspicuous] [Attention Whore] All eyes on me please! [Continental EXTACY] [Pride] Demons number one! [Masochist] J-just ignore that. [Femininity]

Boons: [Hush Money] [HUD] [Hammerspace Inventory] [Status] [Aura's Veil] Good tools for a merchant. [Tasty Prof] [Man Portions] Gluttony is just greed by another name. [Transmog] [Happy Merchant] They never seem to know. [Lucky!] It seems fortunes just gravitate towards me! Of course, somebody else has to suffer misfortunes in my stead. [Permanence] [Sensory Overdose] [JuJu] I-I'm not sure why that's there. Well, removing it now seems pointless, s-so I guess it can stay. [Max Charisma] Sometimes people need to be buttered up.

Items: [Riftgate License] Needed for business. [Shekels] Money, money! [A Home] [A Manor] [Regal Upgrade] [Service] Welcome to my abode! Paid for by honest business. [Home Sweet Tome] No thieves allowed. [Noble's Outfit] The best clothing around. The silk feels nice and the gems adorning it seem to have a hypnotic effect. [Let Them Eat Cake] The tailor said there'd be a balance to these clothes. What did he mean?
