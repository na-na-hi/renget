###->I Am Error, Part 2<- (WIP)
*-> A Paradox Pokemon's Introductory <-*
-> By Iron Valiant-anon <-

It's been a week since my arrival to this Pokemon World. To say I've settled into my new circumstances in is overselling the proposal. I still can't speak anything besides a garbled "Error" which as subsequently became my new name around these parts. My body still made me feel like I'm some sort of metal scarecrow with every sense from my sense of touch to taste and even smell, (which I apparently still had despite no mouth or nose on my face!) feeling dulled and distant, and my anxiety still rattles whatever constitutes as my heart in this mechanical cadaver I'm forced to call my body. Memories of my past life are... In tatters, and leave me feeling disjointed with these emotions. I guess keeping the baggage is some consolation prize to having your old life cast away. Some other former humans at the guild remember more than others and some of them even remember conflicting information. It's like some of us came from different worlds. If it wasn't for the fact that being a robot blows any other revelation that may come forth out of the water, proof of other realities would be simply astounding. I vaguely remember a fondness for such topics and theories... Maybe I enjoyed science fiction? ...What fucking irony.

I remember getting out of my exceptionally fluffy bed, (seriously even my stiff and numb metal joints feel like jelly on this thing, it's like a dream) finding myself to be the last one to wake up, yet again. None of my fellow dorm mates bothered to get me up on time, yet again. The first impression I gave the guild was still a popular gossip among some of the members. I guess a never before seen Pokemon running at a bunch of guild members and screaming like a lunatic before getting laid flat is some of the funniest shit one could see around here. I found myself bearing the moniker of being a Newfag by several of them... That mean turn of phrasing felt familiar too. Being effectively mute, I have gone to carrying my slate and a supply of writing chalk in a shoulder bag bearing the guilds titular clover, along with whatever other little trinkets I pick up along the way that I felt might have some use later.

As I finished packing, my vision distorted with that telltale sign of pink glyphs. Maybe it was yet another glitch or malfunction of this goddamn form. Maybe I was finally going to suffer some fatal malfunction and be snuffed out of this bizarre existence... To my surprise, a fair bit of Intelligible information is fed my way.

Syste-... basic whatnow-... smog who-... A.I. assistant?! What the fuck?!

I stumble over myself as i land hand first back into my bed, gripping the soft plush surface... I then realized, I can FEEL said soft plush surface. I can feel the grain of wood beneath my feet. I can smell the musty smells of what is probably a menagerie of Pokemon in need of a fucking shower! I am understandably feeling joy over the very basic concept of sensation after a week without it. I then tried to speak out, maybe I had a voice too!

"̴E̵r̴r̵o̴r̶!̷"̸

GOD. FUCKING. DAMN. IT. I push myself off the bed forcefully, causing it to creak loudly. I glance around, hoping no one heard me there as I felt pained embarrassment creep through me. I was thankfully still alone but probably not for long. I could hear distant voices echo down from the halls and stairs. I probably missed the breakfast assembly. I'll just grab any old piece of fruit later... Maybe it'll taste better now when I absorb it... I was told I'm expected to pitch in even just a little to the guild if I was going to stay here, even if it couldn't be through combat prowess, albeit they'd value the effort. I looked at my shiny metal arms and the pink luminous blades that are attached to them in contemplation before slouching in defeat.

...I wish I knew how to actually fight.

A chipper, electronic voice suddenly spoke out in my head. If this is what schizophrenia is I'm not sure what everyone is complaining about. I doubt I had friends that were other people when I still was a human. *"Hello there! You appear to be having difficulty acclimating to your body as it is going through system restorations! Would you like me to guide you through your recovery?"*

I glanced around wide eyed, my mind racing with a hundred thoughts as the anxiety started making me go through the paces, I wanted to hide but how the fuck do I hide from THIS? *"Who are you?!"* I screamed within the confines of my mind. A little pink, monochrome entity manifested in the corner of my vision in immediate response. It kind of resembled a light bulb with a grinning face...

*"I am your Real-Time Overseer Terminal and Operations Matrix! Or simply put, your Rotom A.I. assistant! I am as one might say, your ghost in the machine! I became operational exactly 300 seconds ago! I am here to ease critically damaged neural indexes of IVA Units through their recovery! Including, anatomical familiarity, motor function re-calibration, psychological evaluation, and combat training! Where would you like to begin?"*

I slowly sat down back on the bed and tented my fingers as the little Rotom prattled off this information to me, and it was a lot to take in. Was this little thing a Pokemon too? Were there any other hitchhikers inside this body? What the fuck is an IVA Unit... Questions for later. I leered at the fluttering and twirling ghost for a while and if anyone walked in I'd look more insane than usual for it. What a tragedy THAT would be...

*"Can you do anything about my speech impediment?"* I asked it right away. It frowned and shook its little light bulb-shaped head.

*"Unfortunately, certain processes may be disabled or corrupted and must be reconstructed through a non-prioritized list! I thank you for your understanding at this time!"* The electronic spirit twirls and smiles at me, awaiting further queries. I honestly felt patronized.

I sigh, feeling the weight of the undertaking of assimilating into this Pokemon World on my head again. I look up at the saccharine jellybean-of-an-AI and nod. *"I want to learn how to fight. I... I think I'm terrible at it. Nothing about this body feels right and I don't feel like I can carry on living so ineptly like this. I need help."*

The Rotom twirls again. *"You sound depressed! Would you like a psyche evaluation followed by treatment recommendations?"*

I stood up and groaned as I waved at the suggestion dismissively. *"Fuck off with that. Give me a rundown of combat training and recalibrations."* I walked my way out of the dorm halls, evading getting into any encounters with the other guildmates as they crossed my path. I listened intently to Rotom as it manifested diagrams and videos that would ease me into my goals. It seemed some degree of 'aim-assisting' was possible as well. Until I stop feeling like a newborn swinging a wet noodle, I could use the assistance.

With some confidence under my metaphorical belt, I strutted into the dojo on the ground floor. Some guildies were already practicing their reps, sparring, or launching their various special attacks at training dummies. Several others were sitting on their asses in the sidelines and heckling their mates performance with the kind of non-constructive criticism I was beginning to expect from some of them. Rotom immediately highlighted and directed me toward a wooden dummy. I immediately began a regiment of strikes from my arms and legs that sent the spinning dummy into motion. It attracted some attention the more I kept up the routine, phasing out the world around me into single minded focus.

"The femboy robot is training!" "He's been keeping that up for like... half an hour now. What if he breaks it?" "That'd be pretty based not gonna lie." "SpeeeeEeEeeeeEeEen!"

I felt some pride burn through my typically dour mood as I kept up the training before stopping the dummy on the same trajectory it started at with my elbow. There was a mild applause from the observing Pokemon before they dispersed. "It's just like one of my Japanese anime..." "Gay." Rotom winked at me approvingly before vanishing in a puff of pixels and static.

Across from me approached a Meowstic and Combusken; They were Lliam the Guild Master and KFC the Aura Guardian respectively. They both had taken a passing interest in me ever since my arrival. I didn't know if it was an interest taken for my benefit, though...

"Hello, Error! How are you settling in?" He smiled as he nonchalantly brushed a paw through his tousle of white head fur. I quickly reached for my chalk and slate as I jotted down shorthand responses and small talk with the two.

The avian martial artist nodded in solidarity before speaking up. "You've shown some bounding improvement there with your skills. If you don't disapprove, I'd like to spar with you."
