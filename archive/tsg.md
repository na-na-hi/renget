- How can I make Sims 3 run better?
1. Use and configure NRAAS Master Controller with the Integration Module and set all categories to "compact" in CAS settings.
2. Use and configure NRAAS Overwatch, Error Trap, and Register if you're using Pets, Bridgeport, or Isla Paradiso.
3. Use S3PE to merge packages if you have a lot of folders or CC items (DO NOT merge skintones, mods, patterns, defaults, or overrides.)
5. Your game will get slower the more content you've installed. Try only installing the EPs/SPs that you want.

[#3 - Downloading the Games]

The Sims 4
Via Anadius - https://sims.tarac.nl/the-sims-4/the-sims-4-selective-download/ - You can pick and choose which expansions you want if you want to cut down on filesize, or just grab the whole thing in one go.
Via Fitgirl - http://fitgirl-repacks.site/sims-4-deluxe-edition/
Via Games4TheWorld - https://games4theworld.site/sims-downloads/ - Scroll down to "New Format Repacks"
[!]The game usually only recieves new cracks when a major release (EP, GP or SP) happens, so you shouldn't expect minor bugfix patches to recieve cracks.
[!]There are no available torrents for OS X users. Torrent Windows 7, 8.1, or 10 first and install in Bootcamp, then torrent the fix.

------------------------------

The Sims 3 Windows
Via Games4TheWorld - https://games4theworld.site/sims-downloads/
[!]If you're picky and want a repack, ask in the thread and hope someone already knows, or ask Google. 
[!]This site also has the full Store collection. 
[!]Do NOT use cracks. Use the NRAAS No CD Mod instead. If you use cracks and experience issues, then you have learned your lesson. Re-install and try again.

Where can I download the complete collection?: An anon has shared their game and entire mods folder for us, found here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_J6tdQjStiDd184a1VUa0Y3VTQ
>Alternate downloads w/ mods : https://www.mediafire.com/file/gnrl2zwy0dtqt0w/THE_SIMS_CC.iso/file
>Alternate CC w/ mods download: https://www.mediafire.com/file/yorie3ou4yji8i4/Downloads.rar/file
>To install, you don't need a virtual disk drive. Unzip the folder, then look for start.exe. When it asks for the crack, go to the crack folder and enter the serial. Now let it install. When it finishes, go to c:\program files (x86)\maxis\the sims and locate the sims.exe, delete it and replace it with the sims application found in the crack folder. To play in windowed, create a shortcut to your desktop, right click, go to properties and and (space)-w at the end of the target line.
>If you are unsure where to put your downloaded CC, read this guide http://www.angelfire.com/planet/sfctutorials/
***save often. It is an old game and can be prone to crashing. Legit copies also had this problem.****

[#4 - Recommended TS4 Mods]

MC Command Center - https://deaderpool-mccc.com/#/
What is MC Command Center? It's a script mod that adds in an enormous number of gameplay settings and generally just gives the player far more control over their game. If you're interested in autistically controlling your sim's lives even more than you already do, it's a must have. Check the documentation and FAQ on its website if you're lost, the thing's huge.

Reshade - https://reshade.me/#download
A shader injector for all games that will make your game look nicer for screenshots, or even general gameplay. If you are converting from Gshade [this](https://gist.github.com/ry00001/3e2e63b986cb0c673645ea42ffafcc26) may work (untested).

WickedWhims - https://wickedwhimsmod.com/
It's a sex mod for TS4. It recieves updates fairly infrequently and has experienced a bunch of scope creep, but it's also the ONLY working sex mod for TS4, so, if you want to lewd your game up, you're stuck with it. Check the OP to find a Mega link with the most recent Patreon build.

[#5 - General Troubleshooting]
- My Gameplay Mods/Custom Content aren't working or even appearing in Create-A-Sim. (TS4)
Make sure you've opened the Game Options menu, clicked the "Other" tab and checked both "Enabled Custom Content and Mods" and "Script Mods Allowed"

- My CC is making Sims invisible and/or turning them red and white.
Make sure you are not missing an original mesh for a recolor. Check the page you downloaded the CC from, the author probably linked the mesh.

- My CC isn't showing up. (TS2/TS3):
Make sure you are not missing an original mesh for a recolor. Make sure your game is updated. Delete your caches and allow them to refresh. If that fails, then the creator is an idiot and you should look for better CC.

- I moved from a Mac and none of my mods work or throw an error when launching the game (TS2/TS3/TS4):
Follow this guide:
https://davidwalsh.name/recursively-delete
Delete: 
.DS_STORE
._*
._.*

- When playing Sims 3 "Unable to start game. Service initialization failed":
Re-install, and stop using cracks.
http://pastebin.com/v5QWgEgc

- My disc is scratched and can't load the game. (TS3):
Contact EA customer support with box/codes/serial, etc. ready to provide proof you own the game, and they might be able to give you an origin code for the digital version. And be ready to wait, because the service tends to be very slow.

- Unknown Cinematic Error Occurred. (TS3):
Delete your "Cameras" folder and allow it to refresh.

- I'm on a Mac, and have problems with Sims 3
Install Windows 7 or 8.1 via Bootcamp and then play.


[#6 - The Sims 2 Troubleshooting]

- My resolution is stuck on 800x600! How do I fix this?: Find your Graphicsrules.sgr file in C:\Program Files (x86)\Origin Games\The Sims 2 Ultimate Collection\Fun with Pets\SP9\TSData\Res\Config. Open it with notepad and change “seti Low 1” “seti Medium 2” both to 3. Then, open the find box and search for 'ScreenModeResolution'. There will be a bunch of resolutions here, all set at 800x600. Set the first two lines of each one to 1080x1920. Now when you open your game again, you'll find several new resolutions.

- I'm getting black boxes as my sim's shadows: Here is a mod and instructions on how to fix http://modthesims.info/d/569585/sim-shadow-fix-updated-2-jan-16.html
>W7 and 8:http://leefish.nl/mybb/showthread.php?tid=5446

- Where can I get custom content? Lana CC finds and http://allthehairs.podserver.info/?i=1

- How do I install custom content?: Go to C:Documents\EA Games\The Sims™ 2 Ultimate Collection and create a new folder named 'Downloads'. Unzip and paste all your mods here.

- Are there sex mods?: Fan favorite is Tits and Arse by Chris Hatch https://www.mediafire.com/file/h30p3kcc54vmp5m/The_Sims_2_Tits_and_Arse_Stuff.rar/file
>Alternatively, there is also a family friendly version https://www.mediafire.com/file/pmzuvminycam80m/The_Sims_2_Angel_and_Nurses_Stuff.rar/file
>To install these, take the folder of the pack you want to play (you can't have both installed) and drop it in C:\Program Files\EA Games. Run the .Reg file. Then take Sims2EP10.exe found in The Sims 2 Tits and Arse Stuff\TSBin, create a shortcut and put it on your desktop. You must run this .exe every time you want to play with this pack.
