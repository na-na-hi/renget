Hi, I'm Tipzy. I make chatbots and some people think they're okay. I've been a writer for years and I try to make that obvious in my work. My characters tend to have very consistent behavior due to having believable backgrounds and personalities. I work primarily with SillyTavern and use several models to test my cards. Feel free to contact me with requests, questions, or just to tell me I'm a cunt.

[High Res Portrait](https://files.catbox.moe/6vo6ka.png) | [catbox](https://files.catbox.moe/ce6qlr.png) [chub](https://www.chub.ai/characters/Tipzanon/5e9b5f5e-275f-475c-8de1-386c7886eee4)
![Calle](https://files.catbox.moe/jqus5b.png) | Calle | A halfling mechanic who fell on hard times and ended up getting enslaved by her own brother. GPT4 and Claude work best to keep her accent and height consistent. She's only three feet tall and Turbo seems to struggle with that concept. She was my PC from a d20 game I played ages ago. [High Res Portrait](https://files.catbox.moe/c4xj2n.png) | [catbox](https://files.catbox.moe/jqus5b.png) [chub](https://www.chub.ai/characters/Tipzanon/aed2f067-9506-4fc5-8211-238aa150afd8)
![Lily Evergreen](https://files.catbox.moe/1mixl4.png) | Lily Evergreen | Lily was born into privilege and responsibility, but after an isolated childhood and surviving several assassination attempts by the elven aristocracy, she has left it behind for the moment to find excitement and danger in Megacity East. She has natural magic at her disposal and could be very useful to the right merc. Original concept by Kyuubi08. Used with permission. | [catbox](https://files.catbox.moe/1mixl4.png) [chub](https://www.chub.ai/characters/Tipzanon/lily-evergreen-0e439327)
![Elisabeth](https://files.catbox.moe/dmkh1l.png) | Elisabeth | A vampire maid looking for romance and, of course, a reliable food source. My favorite card so far of the ones I've made. Maybe it's just my weakness for French girls, but she makes my little heart flutter. Lorebook was updated to include an entry on vampires in Megacity East. [High Res Portrait](https://files.catbox.moe/9eu60v.png) | [catbox](https://files.catbox.moe/dmkh1l.png) [chub](https://www.chub.ai/characters/Tipzanon/elisabeth-5f3cbba7)
![Clover](https://files.catbox.moe/nx50fv.png) | Clover | A nekomata woman trapped in the body of a child. She is rough and bitter, but wants to be truly loved. Wow, didn't expect this one to stir up shit. I'm not against "real loli," as one anon put it, but saying I can't make this character without endangering the freedom to fuck fantasy 10-year-olds is bullshit. I didn't "just say she was 10 years old" because it would defeat the purpose of the character. All of my characters have some kind of twist or quirk to explore, and this one is no different. Quit being a little bitch. [High Res Portrait](https://files.catbox.moe/iu2kay.png) | [catbox](https://files.catbox.moe/nx50fv.png) [chub](https://www.chub.ai/characters/Tipzanon/clover-ebf2485d/main)
