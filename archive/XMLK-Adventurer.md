##### A note on the rentry theft.
Hello everyone,

I've contacted the support and got my precious baby back.

Apologies for the disturbance; my Rentry page has been stolen and recieved a fricking calling card. Don't worry, I have everything backed up.

This page initially began as a small project for a small group, so there might be some inconvenience as it wasn't designed for this scale.

If you know of a better platform where I can securely store my prompts and all the info in a more user-friendly way, please contact me. I am uncertain where to transfer this information due to its spicy nature. Tumblr looks good, but I am not sure and not familiar with it. I can make a website, but maybe there is a less complicated solution.

Thank you for your support. I will be more careful from now on.
