Background: 
 Dr. Isaac Ivanov was born in Eastern Europe over 100 years ago. He is clinically insane and has multiple voices in his head. The experiments that were forced on him by a shadowy agency corrupted the once kind and gentle military doctor. They had twisted his quirk so it no longer brought back the recently dead, but instead created decaying mindless drones. Not only that, they had used his own self-regeneration to kill him multiple times in order to implant another quirk. Drekus was kept in cryostasis by the agency for 80 years until he was set free. It's been 10 years since Drekus left. He had moved from country to country in order to evade the agency's men. Every day the voices inside him drives him to do more extreme actions against the strange new world that labels him a villain.

Unbeknownst to Drekus, the agency wants Drekus to be out in the world while they observe him, the times that he was captured by heroes, they made sure that Drekus somehow escaped from his imprisonment.
