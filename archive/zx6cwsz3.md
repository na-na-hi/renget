#1. Achoos you

** %#8fce00% !~Bush field, Grass continent~! %%**

"Gimme a few more minutes..." Rain mumbles.

"Mate, we shouldn't stay here too long. I know a couple of Spinaraks who live around here and I'd rather not bump into them." The bird replies.

Rain groans in drowsy annoyance and slowly opens her eyes. She looks up at the taller raven and her eyes widen. Ignoring all fatigue, she hops to her feet. She gives each limb an exploratory shake and tries to get a feel for her new body, then analyses herself.

"I'm an Eevee." She blurts out.

"Right. Are you okay? I found you lying here in the middle of the woods, and I can't tell from your fur if you look pale or not. No offense." He grins. "You passed out the moment you woke up and saw me. Am I really that stunning to look at?"

Rain ignores the joke and looks around at the foliage surrounding them. "Are we in the grass continent?"

"Unless you can name another continent with this many forests, I'd say yeah."

She takes a minute to observe in her surroundings in detail for the first time. She is standing in the middle of a small field with a variety of flowers and bushes that bear comically large berries scattered around. Behind her is a forest littered with oak trees and tall grass, and the front of her seems to lead to a path or clearing. And of course, there was the massive avian creature currently standing before her with a smirk on his beak.

The raven looks proportionally similar to those on Earth, but his face far more expressive than an ordinary bird. His sky blue wings end in black and his feathers appear slightly ruffled but fluffy to touch. The talons on the ends of his feet seem almost metallic and give off a subtle sheen. She recognises him as the 8th gen flying type - a Corvisquire. If she had to guess, he stands more than a foot taller than her on all fours.

All fours... Rain turns in a circle as she examines herself again. Her point of view is noticeably closer to the ground. Her ears swivel around independently, but with some effort, she can rotate them conciously. Most of her fur is a light grey, while the fluff covering her neck and tip of her tail are white. She is covered with dirt and leaves from being laid on the ground for so long. Her tail hangs low just above the floor, twitching occasionally. Noting her heightened sense of smell, she sniffs and faces the other Pokemon.

"Uh... Corvisquire? How long was I out?"

"Hmm, I'd say about 5 minutes? Not sure how long before that though. You can call me Cory, by the way."

"Thanks for, uh, looking out for me, Cory. My name is Rain."

"Man, like the weather?"

Rain rolls her eyes. "Like the weather."

"Well then Rain, do you remember where you were headed? I came here to gather berries for supplies before I noticed you just lying here."

"I- I don't know. I'm... not from around here."

"Oh. You got amnesia or something? Whats the last thing you remember before passing out?"

"I was with my brother, but I don't remember being a Po-" Rain contemplates telling Cory about her formerly being human, then decides against it. Do Pokemon here think humans existed? What if the Pokemon in this universe are hostile to humans? Maybe humans exist in this world and are at war with Pokemon? Or if there are other humans who were transported to this realm, caused non-stop issues for the native Pokemon and gained a reputation for being aut-

"How about we take a walk to jog your memory? If you've got nowhere to be, I was looking around for a place to stay tonight, and I've heard about a town not too far from here."

"Sure, might as well."

"Great! Let's pick out a few berries on the way out - try to find the round pink ones. They're the sweetest. "

"I've never seen a... *miscoloured* eevee before. Well, there was that *one* Caterpie I saw a while back, but maybe he just had jaundice..." Cory rambles on. "What about your brother, is he like you?"

"Well, no. He's... a normal colour." Rain stutters. "Cory, what do you think about *humans*?"

"Humans?" Cory cocks his head. *Very raven-like*, Rain notes. "Well I asked my father about it when I was a hatchling, but all he said was: '*Human fairytales are for idiots. Now stop wasting my time.*'. But I think its cooler to think they existed."

Rain looks down at the ground beneath her and slows her pace. Seems like humans are just a fable here, which confirms her suspicions of being put in a world close to the PMD series.

Lost in thought, she starts to think about her family and friends.

Did she die and reincarnate here? Is her human self currently in a coma on Earth? Her head starts to hurt again, and she tries to literally shake the thoughts out of her head. If this is anything like the games, she will find her answer eventually.

In the meantime, she needs to tolerate this crow comedian.

"Hey Rain, look," Cory gestures to the grass next to them and picks some out with his beak. "I think *weed* make a good couple."

"Ha ha. Good one." Rain responds. "But I wouldn't call that a weed, those leaves look like they belong to a flower."

She walks over to the patch of grass Cory is standing over and sure enough, sees a small cluster of bright blue flowers. The flowers are larger but nonetheless, she recognises them from her hometown.

"Myosotis," She whispers.

"Uh, gesundheit?" Cory replies.

"No that wasn't- I mean, thats the species of this particular flower. Myosotis. Though they're usually known as Forget-Me-Nots. I used to see them a lot around my home."

"*Forget-Me-Nots*? Thats pretty ironic."

"I guess so." Rain agrees.

***

** %#ffe823% !~Sunflower Meadow~! %% **

"...unbe*leaf*able? That's the best you came up with?" Rain repeats, as the duo continues walking down the dirt path.

"You try to make plant puns then!" Cory says. "Also, you're leaving me to do *all* the talking. C'mon, Rain! At least tell me one thing about yourself that's not being a huge flower nerd."

Rain shrugs. "I can't help it. I've got amnesia."

"An amnesiac that remembers about 100 fun facts for plants?"

"Hey man, I don't get to choose what I can and cannot remember."

"Then I guess you'll have to settle with my subpar jokes, *bud*."

Rain rolls her eyes.

The raven Pokemon stops short. "Wow. Those are some really big flowers."

After hearing nothing but poorly made jokes for the past 10 minutes, Rain sighs relief. The two Pokemon take a break from their long walk to look over the giant meadow of sunflowers before them. Cory is just tall enough to peek out above it, but Rain has no such luck. The sea of yellow stretches out to the horizon, while the footpath they are on seems to split off around it.

"I've never seen a sunflower field this big in my life, Rain comments. "This can't be a natural field. Someone is definitely tending to them..."

She takes a step closer to the pasture and takes a sniff. She smiles at the nostalgic scent of earth and freshly turned leaves.

Without warning, a light breeze kicks up some of the loose pollen and sends it right up her nostrils. She twitches, crinkles up her nose, then sneezes loud enough to make Cory flinch.

**"ACHOOO!"**

...and sends several small, bright stars flying into the ground in front of her with a *bang*.

As the dust dissipates, Cory stares at Rain as she stands frozen in shock.

"I think that might be sneeze of the year."

"Oh my God. That was *Swift*, right?"

"Yeah, and I think that was the biggest one I've ever seen."

Rain shakes off any dust stuck on herself and expells the remaining pollen from her nose. In the middle of the row of flora, there is now a small, shallow, eevee-sized crater with leaves and roots strewn about. Rain's jaw drops and her heart races at the surprise of using a move for the first time. Before either of the two could say anything, someone shrieks.

"My sunflowers!"

The flowers in front of them part as a smaller, humanoid sunflower makes its way through.

"Was trashing my beauties then beating me up once not good enough for you? I've already told your guildmaster not to let you guys to come here and destroy my work again..."

Now out of the sunflower thicket, they get a full view of the peculiar stranger. It has a green trunk and leaves as limbs, and a thick sunflower for a head.

"It took me weeks to restore my field after that *Chespin* came... please just leave me alone and don't bully me anymore..." Tears start to form on Sunflora's eyes. Rain shifts awkwardly.

"Oh man sorry about that, mate. I don't think Rain did it on purpose." Cory says, rummaging in his satchel. "Here's a Pecha berry as a token of our apology, we'll get outta your hair- or should I say petals -now."

Cory places a round pink berry in the Sun Pokemon's hand-leaves, and he accepts it reluctantly.

"And please tell your guildmates to leave me and my flowers alone..."

"Wait," Rain interrupts. "*Guildmates*?"

Sunflora sniffs. "Y-yeah. Aren't you two part of that 'Clover' guild in Capim town? They're the only ones who keep causing trouble around here."

Cory was already turning to leave, but upon the mention of a guild, Cory whips his head back around to face them.

"A guild! Could you point us in their direction?"

The Sunflora meekly points in a direction away from the field.

"Thanks! We'll be off then!" Cory starts off in the pointed route. Rain apologises again to Sunflora, then paces quickly to catch up with Cory.

She briefly wonders how a Sunflora's digestive system works.

***

** %#8fce00% !~En route to Capim Town~! %% **

Rain and Cory stop in their tracks when a small group of arachnid Pokemon emerge from the forest in front of them.

Two of the three intruders at the back are small green arachnid Pokemon with a pair of red mandibles with a white horn on their heads. The one in front is of similar shape and build, but of a larger size and a scarlet red in colour. The larger of the three is visibly pissed off, and clicks its mandibles in indignation.

Rain feels goosebumps all over as the Ariados towers over her. It gives Rain a quick look up and down, scoffs, then turns to glare at Cory.

"Was wondering where all that chatter came from," it says, glancing over the dirt hole. "You still never shut up, *Cory*?"

"He does yap a lot..." Rain mumbles.

"I see you've evolved, Spinny! And you know I love my jokes." Cory shrugs his wings.

"Boss, you know this bird?" A Spinarak asks.

Rain turns her head towards Cory and gives a puzzled expression, as if to ask a similar question.

"Oh me and Spinny met a *long* time ago. I used to love tortur- uh, *pranking* him." He starts. "There was one time, I was trying to learn scary face and I needed someone to practice on..."

"Don't finish that story. And stop calling me Spinny, it doesn't even fit anymore." Ariados growls, which was a bizzare sound for a spider to make.

"So I thought I'd get little *Spinny* here to help! Except I didn't tell her she was helping me. And I thought if I did it at night it'd scare her better. And I actually already *learned* the move..."

The short story causes Rain to sigh, and she frowns at the memory of her brother doing something similar to her in the past.

"Spinny *may* have peed out of fright. A little." Cory stifles a chuckle. The Ariados, however, has clear rage written all over her face as she turns a deeper shade of red than she already is.

"I'm going to **kill** you."

Spinny the Ariados pounces onto Cory.

***

Rain gulps in awe.

The past few minutes have been a blur, starting with an extremely pissed off Ariados leaping onto Cory. The former tried to maim the latter with her sharp, spiny legs while airborne but Cory simply took a step to the side and parried with a wing. Its only been more chaotic since then, and all the Eevee can do is stare as her first real, live Pokemon battle takes place in front of her. 

A flurry of purple-tipped needles fly out from Ariados' mouth towards Cory. He reacts by leaping backwards with the aid of his wings, letting the Poison Sting hit the ground beneath him with several loud *thuds*.

![Cory VS Ari](https://i.imgur.com/exEJOVs.png)

He folds his wings and grins. The raven breathes a little heavier than usual, but he is clearly not taking it seriously.

"I've gotta say, you must've trained hard, huh?"

The bug type responds by sending out another Poison Sting, this time aimed at his face. Cory ducks down and to the side to avoid the second volley. A needle narrowly misses his beak, and Ariados lets out a disappointed *tsk*.

"Shut the hell up and fight back, you stupid chicken!"

"Aw man, no need to be so harsh, Spin-"

"You two, stop standing there and *get* him!" Exasperated, Ariados yells at the two Spinarak bystanders.

"Y-yes ma'am!"

Cory's smile drops as Spinny fires a third Poison Sting at him, this time accompanied by two String Shots. He dips to the left and dodges a majority of the projectiles, but one String Shot finds its mark and winds itself around a wing. The flying type lets out a squawk and stumbles. Before he regaining his footing, the great spider fires another, denser round of webs at which wrap around his body, rendering his wings immobile. He gestures with his beak at Rain.

"Rain, think you can help a mate out?" He smiles weakly.

"Cory, I don't know any moves!" Rain panicks.

"Damn, *really*? But I *just* watched you-"

The Ariados makes a clicking sound in annoyance and starts pacing towards the disabled raven.

"Woah woah woah, chill out!" Cory says, hopping backwards, away from his captor. "I've got a bunch a berries in my bag, and they're all fresh! You can take them!"

"I'm not going to actually *kill* you, Cory. I'll just embarass you like you did to me last time. And I think I'll start by plucking out all your feathers 'till you're flightless." She sharpens her front legs like a pair of knives.

"Oh, oh I got it! Rain, *Achoo*! Achoooo!" He signals to the worried Eevee.

Rain looks at him questioningly, until she understands. Immediately, she uses both paws to pluck out a lengthy blade of grass on the side and starts tickling her nose with it. After she feels the familiar itching inside her nostrils, she faces the confused Ariados. Then sneezes.

**"ACHOOO!"**

Rain's little body recoils from the extreme force expelled out her nose. A barrage of stars form in front of her, zipping towards an astonished Spinny. She tries to dart out of its way, but the attack simply curves and follows the spider's every movement. The move finally hits her mid-jump, and she hollers in pain. Her enormous body lands in a loud crash and a cloud of dust forms, separating Rain and Cory from their three assailants.

***

The Eevee-Corvisquire duo swap between looking at the unconscious Ariados, bewildered Spinaraks, and finally, at each other.

"Mate, that was great! But we gotta run, I don't think she'll stay down for long." Cory says worriedly. Wings still bound tightly from the previous String Shot, he starts hopping away.

Disoriented from what was the largest and loudest sneeze of her life, Rain simply nods and follows suit.

"...and if you ever need to sneeze again, let me know so I have time to escape."
