#### Trip
https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/thread/89025897/#89028233
If you were voted in to choose a location, and could take your team/class to a field trip where would you go? Would you show-off something personal to you like your hometown? Would you take them somewhere for training or education? Maybe they could just chill in your basement?

If you're a loner, what new place have you always wanted to visit? 
#### Worst Deed
https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/thread/89049516/#89050388

#### Children
https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/thread/89193014/#89193540
How would your character intend to raise any potential child of theirs? How tolerant will they be of their kid(‘s/s’) personal decisions? What kind of politics and virtues will they try to instill into them? Will they raise their child(ren) based on their sex/gender? How strict or lenient will they be with them? Any career path they’re going to force them into? Or perhaps they’ll be absent/deadbeat parents to them? 
#### Change Policy
https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/thread/89236783/#89240948
Your character has just been placed in an incredibly privileged position. They are allowed to alter, remove, or add any ONE (1) policy/law in Japan. The government and law enforcement will do its utmost best with its available resources to meet the requirements that your character desires with the removal/addition/change of a law. Everyone is expected to follow it, unless you desire it to only be followed by a select demographic, and you can have there be a fine or even jail time for not adhering to it. Women are required to wear all pink on Friday, else be fined 10,000 yen? This can be done. All guns are now legal, and require no permit? Done. Nationally-mandated Hinduism that everyone has to follow? Done. (Dissenters will exist, of course)

https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/thread/89250887/#89251745
Students/Heroes/Villains/Supporters, how do you train your quirk? Do you use any gadgets or tools to help you train? Is there a theory behind your training, like how someone who sweats nitroglycerin might try to get their pores to open up?
Always remember that quirks are a part of your body! They get stronger with constant training and get weaker if you don't use them for a while.

How do you stay on top of your quirk training?
#### FASHION
https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/thread/89250887/#89254306

# Class 1-D
###Soujyuuro Imai HN "Wise Eye Hero, Mahoudeva"
52.
>Imai's ringtone for his mom
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsJ3JjpZyoA
>Imai's ringtone for his sister
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRrVohvRCk0

He only has those contacts in his phone. If he got his classmates' numbers he would put custom ringtones for all of them. 
61.
Imai is a decent singer but would do pretty badly at karaoke since most of the songs he's familiar with aren't meant for that. As a side effect of his music taste, he's also good at avoiding engrish.

As for his voice, idk, I tried to find a seiyuu I thought would fit him, this is the best I could come up with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jImhLUl815A

###Christopher Cain HN "Mirror Devil"
51.
He lives in a relatively low density zone. Houses not apartments though they're packed fairly tight, no-one really has a yard as an example. 
52.
The default one. 
54.
Dad makes his favorite meal. Now that he has friends? Fuuuuuck if I know. I still don't know his birthday.
55.
Seiryu, Smokin' Sexy or Rosethorn would be my top choices for him. Seiryu because I can think of some funny scenes. Smokin' Sexy because I think they'd actually be good for each other. Rosethorn because she's used to handling Christopher and he already respects her so it'd be a smooth transition. Also she'd meet Christopher's smoking hot father.
56.
Christopher would probably want to take the class to Tokyo. Any pranking of UA that may or may not occur is incidental and against his plans. 
57.
Skip class is as bad as he's ever done, if you don't count lies of omission.
58.
Chocolate Milk 
59.
Christopher would be a great Butler in some respects, managing the household inventory, planning for parties, etc.. Mediocre in others, cleaning and actually serving. And actually bad at things like cooking.
He'd be seen not heard.
60.
It's a toss up between Goulash and Corned Beef with Horseradish sauce. I think I've said his favorite Japanese food is Yakisoba. 
61.
Terrible. He has a great voice but he doesn't actually know any popular songs.
62.
Laid back. He’d see his primary job as a father to help the kids stand up, not keep them from falling. But for all the little things, as long as they feel safe at home, it’s enough. 
63.
OOC, but: Make it law that everyone has to say "You're doing a great job" to Popsy if they see her.
IC: probably declassify government documents about heroes/ villains he's interested in. 
64.
Please, I'm still recovering from the body pillows
65.
Practices and analyzes other people's quirks. He's going to start trying to visualize his own quirk to help improve his mastery over it through meditation, but I haven't gotten there yet.
66.
>What's your fashion?
Sandatsu-anon captured it pretty well. He prefers loose-fitting comfortable clothes and tends to wear jackets well out of season, he gets cold easily. He mostly sticks to earthy colors like browns, greens, grays, etc.. His favorite color is a bright blue, but he doesn't think it suits him. As far as shoes, if he could get away with it he'd just wear loafers wherever he could, though he does use sneakers for 'work.'
>Special Occasion
Black Suit, White Undershirt, Blue Tie, Black Dress Shoes. Don't overthink it.

###Noah Abrams HN "Archangel"
51.
Noah lives in a quiet neighborhood, traditional type of architecture, tighter streets and alleys, and mostly elderly folk living there. He knows most of his neighbors since he helps them out if he sees them struggling with groceries or something.
52.
Noah has music that starts off quiet and ramps up, in consideration for other people so that they don't get surprised. Music like In the Hall of the Mountain King but with a shorter intro.
He has this for his parents though: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvgB0ZaOhaQ
53.
For advice to someone else, Noah would say to talk to someone about it and volunteering himself to listen if no one else would. For himself, no need because the next day will be better (if it's not, then the day after, or the one after that, etc).
54.
Noah's birthdays are usually quiet affairs, spent mostly with his family. Sometimes the neighbors come and greet him since it's also Christmas. Outside looking in, it'd just look like a small Christmas dinner with his family than a birthday.
55.
The one closest to Noah's ideal version of a hero is Rosethorn, so he'd want to intern under her. Although I think it would be far more interesting if he was assigned under Majestic, their clash in personality and vision is funny think about. Also perfect scenario for a Majestic redemption arc. Or not, that's fine too.
56.
If only within Japan, he would want to take the class to Hokkaido and get cozy in the hot springs. If the whole world is allowed, then he would like to be self-indulgent and go to the Vatican, or Italy at least.
57.
A candy wrapper fell out of Noah's pocket and he couldn't throw it in the garbage.
58.
Not a glass, but Noah drinks a bottle of Yakult after a nice bath. 
59.
Noah would be a powerful butler/maid (he can probably work either outfits), especially in the cleaning aspects. He'd be the competent type that would have everything done by breakfast.
Simultaneously everyone and no one. One day you might just find your home broken into and every single chore has been done, every inch cleaned. 
60.
Noah's preferred foods are on the sweeter end, but if he were to choose a favorite, he'd go for cheesecakes. Not the Japanese type though, he likes them, but he prefers the smooth and creamy texture of New York-style cheesecakes. Noah had a taste of it when his father lamented missing a local recipe back when he lived in the US so his mother suggested they try to recreate it themselves, so it good memories are tied to him liking cheesecakes.
61.
Unsurprisingly, Noah has a boy soprano voice with no signs of going deeper any time soon. He is pretty good at singing, but he doesn't care about singing well when invited to karaoke, his enjoyment among friends matters more. 
Example of his singing voice: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjA6M51buqM
62.
Noah would do his best in raising them to be moral and virtuous people. He would take after his own dad, and respect their choices, even in matters of faith. It would be nice if they show interest and gladly take part in his faith, but he wouldn't force it on them. If they were really adamant about it, he'd talk to Sally about it. Now this doesn't mean he'd just let them do whatever they want, he will educate them and try to turn them away from disagreeable decisions, but with the way he is, he would probably leave harsher punishment to Sally.
>how Noah would handle the large amount of kids he wants to have
The first few children would probably be a rough time, maybe ask Uncle Inigo to pay for maids and nannies to help around. It would get much easier once they're older and can help with the younger children, and having them help would bring the family closer together too. Any squabbles and conflicts he would immediately try to handle, he doesn't want any resentment between them.
63.
More social welfare programs or reforming the justice rehabilitation system.
64.
Noah would have small picture books for kids. The main character would be an angel and it would follow him exemplifying moral and virtuous deeds, basically trying to teach and inspire younger generations to be good people.
65.
For the more unusual side of his quirk, Noah keeps his wings clean for maximum light absorption and then just normal practice in efficiently distributing light between releasing it as a stun or in increasing striking power. Aside from that, just the usual exercise for his wings.
66.
Since Noah's tops are custom-fit around his wings, most of them end up being business-casual ones like dress shirts, and his bottoms are usually dress shorts (or pants if it's cold) then loafers (casual) or dress shoes to match. If he needs to add a couple more layers, he would either wear a sweater vest and a cardigan or a blazer for more formal occasions. He doesn't wear accessories often, but when he does, he prefers suspenders over belts and he wears a ribbon neck tie the same shade of red as his eyes. Pic related is pretty close to how he'd dress on a Sunday.

He still has other clothes on the casual end, like a turtleneck sweater a size or two bigger and normal jeans and shorts, but he rarely wears those outside.

###Sandatsu Owari
65.
sandatsu has just recently started to realize that he can train his own quirk by decideig to absorb other quirks or not
66.
i've never thought about it
but i liked the idea of him wearing overalls with the uppeer part tied to his waits
and simple tshirts and hiking boots

###Son Jugo HN "Aspara"

###Yui Sagara HN "The Binding Hero, Capture Cloth"
53.
If something really bothers her and the source isn't someone she can beat up, Yui just does what she normally does (make something/run/etc) or tries to get friends together to do something. She's not the best at dealing with her feelings, but it's more about not letting whatever happened "control" her..
54.
She orders a cake and spends the day with her cat. Maybe buys some sprinklers and such or makes her own decorations to liven things up. There's a spot she ties a ribbon around every year too.
If she can get away with it then she probably won't even invite anyone since she would think it's worth mentioning.
55.
Yui's unlikely to get any offers from big names because of her situation, but she'd probably want to reject most of them anyway. The idea of being someone's sidekick isn't an appealing one for her and while she's pretty determined to graduate, she's not completely sold on being a Hero yet.
She also just dislikes rich/popular people too.
>Popsy
One of the few heroes she's probably kept up with to some extent due to liking her as a kid and thinking she's cool because of all the controversy. Wanting to see Popsy succeed would make her a bit more dedicated to being a hero. Maybe not exactly determined become number 1 in ranking, but she'd be determined to make sure people see her mentor as she does.
>Rosethorn
Someone she's already familiar with and who genuinely wants to support her. She probably still has a bit of bitterness towards her teacher but she does see her as reliable compared to most other adults/heroes.
>Nocti
Not a hero, but vigilantism fits Yui pretty well. Really, if Nocti invited her to do vigilante work she'd be receptive even with a proper internship since she already trusts her.
>Seiryu
Only reasons she'd want or get want an internship with him is Orochi, and might put in extra effort to impress him because of it but otherwise don't think there's much chemistry.
>Smokin' Sexy
She could get behind his attitude and she might fit well as an underground hero. Would also get some of the perceived coolness factor that Popsy does, though not to the same extent.
>Karma
Unlikely at tis point, but of the villains she seems the most 'fun' and so is more likely to get her on board than anyone else. 
56.
I don't think Yui would have a place she really wants to go or anything personal that could make for a trip. Maybe she'd want to see the Burj Khalifa to climb and mark it or something like that. Otherwise, where doesn't matter much. If t's just her likes/wants than she'd want to go see her favorite band or drag everyone to try out an onsen and just do nothing.

She's a bit into fashion so she might enjoy a Paris trip. It's fairly possible she's just think everything look dumb/she can do better though. 
58.
Probably just tap water, but Yui pretty regularly snatches drinks from vending machines. Especially likes flavored milks, so that'd be her go to for a treat.
She's more of a social drinker so she doesn't go out if her way for booze unless it's for something special. 
59.
Yui'd be blunt and only do what she has to do, but she'd doo a decent job. Caring for her cat probably gives her some points towards service.
I should really get around to having her apply to Thanks a Latte. Other than that I can only really imagine her working for Orochi or Inigo's family. 
61.
A bit rough and deep for a girl. It's been a while since I've paid attention VAs so maybe something like Ado, Sayaka Ohara or Suisei. She's got good rhythm so probably decent even is she doesn't really sing much. The stuff she enjoys might be a bit off putting for more traditional tyrps since she's mostly into rock and metal stuff, plus rap. She likes loud and aggressive but probably knows some soft, mushy songs too.
62.
Yui would give her kids lots of freedom, but still be there to make sure they get too hurt and help them fix whatever they broke. She's happy to let them figure themselves, the only thing she really tires to instill being confidence in their own abilities and some tenacity. She'd want them to fight their own battle but won't mind teaching them how to fight or intimidating bullies.
She'll shower them with as much love as she wants even if she has to tie them up when they become mood teens.
64.
Clothing makes the most sense for Yui, maybe with a selling point of her thread being. It wouldn't be very practical for mass production, but I think for my image of her as relatively small hero that has more intimate relationship with her fans. 
65.
Her crafts started as a way train her control and push her production and they still do even if Yui has grown to love making things with her threads. Other than that she uses whatever heavy tuff she can find to strain them and build durability..
It's a bit hard to train the esoteric aspects outside sparring so that mostly just means trying to read Ako's mind.
66.
Since I tried answering something like this before:
The way Yui dresses wouldn't change much. She would want to be more eye-catching fort her partner, but I'm not sure if there's not much to be done there. Her usual getup is some form of jacket/hoodie, sweater/crop top/t-shirt/etc, and shorts/something baggy and a scarf when it's cold. Most of her clothes are pretty old and either handmade or remade after suffering wear. She makes sure that all the fixes are obvious so that it stands out as hers. I guess her overall all style would be overall punkish, but it's not like she adheres to any strict code. She just wears what feels nice and she think looks good.

Additional sluff that might matter:
A good number of her shirts are probably merch for niche bands she likes she's probably put some patterns into things.
I mentioned before that she made charms and puts some on her bag. They might also show up in other places like as an earring or something. More something she'd do when she's older.
She wouldn't go out of her way to rip jeans but if tore in way she thought looked cool she'd leave it.
Wears one set of sneaker she likes pretty much everywhere but also has a pair of boots.
Her things generally have a lot of red due to her thread so she gravitates to colors that go well with it.
Phased out dresses and skirts pretty early and doesn't really wear them outside of school.
Her hair isn't long enough now, but she liked to tie a bunch of ribbons into it when she was younger.

I'd say her style is a result of circumstance and a desire to "be herself" as well factors like access to her quirk and what feels good to run/swing around in.
Special occasions generally wouldn't change much. She doesn't have anything formal, but like for the beach and festival episodes she might be willing to make something with a bit of her own flare to it.

###Chihiro Mitsurugi HN "Ascetic Sword Hero: Yako"
51.
Living the forest hermit grindset, Chihiro has no neighbors save for the local wildlife. Larger animals like Deer or Boars have learned that her 'territory' is dangerous and avoid it, but smaller things like racoons, squirrels, foxes, and birds treat it like a safe space where predators aren't found. It's also very pretty.
That said, while it's not exactly neighbors, Shion visits very often, and Walpurgis 'visits' very often (i.e. she sneaks through the woods and stakes out the place).
The area near the entrance to the dojo treat the dojo as a cursed place and don't let their kids into the bamboo grove. Even some households moved out of the area, causing it to be somewhat desolate. 
52.
Chihiro doesn't know what that is. She probably(?) has a cellphone, but she doesn't mess with the settings.
53.
Well, Chihiro... Frankly just accepts the pain. She's determined that she deserves it, and makes no attempts to bury it or get rid of it. It's just something that has a permanent place in the back of her head.
54.
Chihiro forgets about her birthday entirely until Shion or someone else brings it up. She's essentially the type that needs to have a birthday party forced upon her.
55.
Chihiro isn't familiar enough with all the Pro Heroes to really make an informed decision, and moreover, she's worried that any place she goes, she would only be a nuisance. She wouldn't want to harm the hand that feeds her after all. Ideally, she'd go somewhere quiet where her infamy won't follow, like a disgraced Hero (Popsy) or an underground Hero (Smokin' Sexy, Seiryu).
Really though, she'd be surprised if she got any offers at all. 
56.
Chihiro wouldn't really know what to pick, but her goal is to find something that most of the class would benefit from as opposed to her own hobbies/lifestyle (so no visiting famous dojos or anything). It also largely is based on how it's exactly asked of her. For example, if it's supposed to be a replacement for a school field trip, and the person explaining it to her describes school field trips as 'fun places to goof off and make friends' then she'd try for something along those lines, maybe an amusement park.
If the person that describes a school field trip to her says 'it's a event to broaden your horizons and gain experience' then she'd think it's a form of training and would advocate for something like a joint training exercise with U.A.
If everyone refuses to give her any kind of hint at all she might choose the amusement park because she's always wanted to go to one but didn't get a chance when she was young- her parents were waiting until she was a little older. Also she doesn't think U.A. is any stronger than her classmates, so a joint training exercise wouldn't be anything vital. The Principals indoctrination is very effective on the naïve saber.
57.
Uh... Well... Do I really need to spell this one out at this point?
59.
Chihiro as a maid, eh...? I wonder if she'd be a traditional Japanese maid or a western one? Either way, she's very loyal and diligent, familiar with cleaning, and passable as a cook, so she'd make a great low tier maid. A high class maid that predicts her masters orders and can perform unexpected tasks would be difficult however, she'd need to grow into the role. Still, I think she overall has great potential in that career.
And she'd be the seen and not heard type. Bonus points for being the combat maid whose broom is actually a sheath.
Hmm... Good question. Like Sally pointed out, Inigo would be a funny option for Chihiro or any of the girls. Could also be fun to be Hoge's maid instead, making it her job to either shoo Inigo away or secretly help him meet up with Hoge depending on said mistresses mood.
Past that, I think the most fitting would be someone like Orochi who comes from an old family. 
60.
I'm not sure what exactly Chihiro's favorite food is. (I don't really feel like I know enough about Japanese food). I know she likes bitter foods however, and I also feel like she'd enjoy the spiciness of wasabi. For now, let's go say sushi with wasabi. 
61.
Chihiro's voice is on the deeper end of the Japanese school girl spectrum. She can keep time and rhythm well, but her voice is flat. Even worse, she'd probably try to sing Enka music even though it lives and dies on having an expressive voice. She's probably be oddly good at something more like rap, but she doesn't know any songs like that. 
62.
Chihiro would probably stop (or at least cut down) on being a hero to spend more time raising any kids. Her main method of child raising would be to expose her kids to new things and let them gain first hand experience, rather than rely on only telling them or showing them. She'd try to be more respectful of their decisions rather than pushing them to do things.
She'd very much be a helicopter mother that drowns her kids in love.

While probably too lenient, there are limits. She wouldn't want her kids to fall to things like drugs or villainy. 
63.
Frankly Chihiro has neither the confidence or knowledge to know what to change that would be good for the country, nor the desire to make a selfish law. At best, maybe she'd ask for something minor like a small budget increase for cultural events like festivals. Or maybe she'd just ask a friend for advice and let them pick.
64.
She doesn't really think anyone would want merchandise of herself, so she'd probably try to do something vaguely related if she was forced into a merch deal. Like maybe she'd try to put out a line of toy swords or practice swords to reference her dojo, or maybe she'd find some way to drag other people into the deal by making it about her 1-D friends as a whole.
Really though, if there's a timeline where Chihiro is actually a Pro-Hero, she's an underground hero.
65.
Chihiro's drain is done through her pores, but it's also a kind of 'breathing' where she breathes in through her pores. So something training to open his pores (rapid exposure to hot water) is something she can do. She can also do exercises for lung training except, which basically amounts to cardio (using her quirk while doing exercise) and deep breathing exercises (she likes to do this one while meditating). She also goes to areas without any life to train her quirk, acting as something similar to high altitude training.
For the speed boost portion of her quirk, she has a variety of exercises she rotates between. Sometimes she takes in a lot of energy and then tries to sprint around the mountains at maximum speed to help her adjust to moving that fast for prolonged periods. Sometimes she practices uses her speed boost in very short spurts to improve efficiency. Sometimes she tries to balance her drain and her speed boost to practice maintaining a minimum output, as a means of endurance training and preparation for drawn out 1 v 1 fights.
66.
Chihiro's wardrobe essentially consists of kimonos, yukata, etc.. She might have some more normal clothes somewhere, but unless someone goes out of their way to get her to wear them, she'll just wear her traditional Japanese clothes. It's mostly a comfort thing because she's used to wearing them.
As for how she would approach fashion in general, she's in the camp that believes in natural beauty. No make-up, or at least very little. No accessories, or piercings. Clothes that aren't overly fancy but are feminine. This isn't even about her self-esteem issues, it's just what she personally is fond of.
To put it another way, if Chihiro was told to pick out an outfit relying only on a purely western wardrobe, complete with everything from jewelry and make-up to dresses to sportswear, she would just pick out a plain white sundress and sandals.

###Ashleigh Katsuragi HN "Blackout"
53.
If something happens that really bothers her, Ashleigh will just sit and listen to music in the dark for hours. There's a good chance that later on, she'll go lay in bed and cry until she can't anymore.
58.
Ashleigh is probably sitting at her computer with a glass of green tea... or Woter.
60.
Ashleigh is also a steak enjoyer. Papa Katsuragi is phenomenal behind the grill, and it's always a special occasion when he's able to take the time to grill up something nice for the girls. She has fond memories of these times.
61.
Ashleigh would probably be quite good at singing sort of punk or emo, screamy-yelly kinds of songs. Though, that's a talent she'd definitely keep to herself. That sort of singing would feel deeply personal and private to her. She probably wouldn't even do it in private, to avoid the chance of Mio witnessing it through a memory.

As for what she would sound like? In my brief search, I believe Amelia Watson to be the vtuber with the voice that most closely matches what I have for her in my head. Ashleigh's voice is a lot less energetic and probably a tad bit lower and breathier, but it's a good approximation. 
66.
Ashleigh is the type of autistic mfer who is always wearing a jacket because being without one makes her feel weird and anxious. The rest of her wardrobe mostly consists of skirts, shorts, and simple colored shirts and band tees. She also owns a few cute shirtdresses, but has never found a good opportunity to wear any of them. For footwear, it's always either going to be huge black boots or high-top converse. She usually (but not always) wears thighhighs. If it gets cold enough, she'll begrudgingly wear jeans.

Her wardrobe heavily consists of blacks, whites, blues, and grays.

###Sally McCathy HN "Last Rite"
51.
Sally probably lives in the same apartment building as Christopher, though her apartment is at present dirty and disorganized cause she’s not used to living on her own.
Her neighbors are probably afraid of her given everything about her, including her tendency to break curfew to go shooting at trees in the woods so she can blow some steam off.
Nobody steals her newspaper cause it’s in Eigo, besides the occasional curious kid. 
53.
Sally sneaks out to the woods and shoots trees and tree stumps with low calibers, blowing off steam.
Otherwise, she turns on some Lynard Skinnard and BTFOs some kids on COD.
54.
Back in the USA, her dad got the grill out and a whole platter of smokey meats: Hot Dogs, Burgers, Steaks, the essentials. Her mom would get help making a cake from some friends as pretty much anyone within 5 miles was invited to celebrate
In Japan, she has yet to experience a birthday, and all she plans to do is go to a steakhouse and hope its half as good as her dad's steak.
55.
As discussed in the last thread, Sally is probably screwed on an internship unless an underground hero is willing to try and teach her. 
56.
Sally would try and convince Shiketsu to fly all of 1-D over to Montana so they could train on her parent's property, and so she could have an excuse to go home for a while. 
57.
Goes without saying Sally's worst secret is her act of double manslaughter/murder.
Otherwise, she hides and embarrassingly large amount of stuffed animals she brought from home which she hugs at night. 
58.
Sally likes to spend her Saturday nights drinking hot cocoa and lemonade she makes from freshly squeezed lemons to try and replicate her mom's old recipe, which had just the right amount of sweetness.

She assuredly has never had a little too much beer on the 4th of July.
59.
The wealthy bishop's son, Noah Agrams, and his loyal and protective maid Sally McCathy...

Of course, it would be funnier if Inigo was her master, as well as for a lot of the other girls in the class. 
60.
Sally grew up around ranchers who knew the perfect way to grill beef, so she's partial to steak unless it's lent. 
61.
Sally is a good singer but is very, very shy about everywhere but church. She'd have to be drunk or around friends to actually try with a song. 
62.
It goes without saying the Religion and church will be a major part of Sally's kids lives, even if they don't like it.
As for their personal decisions, Sally just wants them to be safe with their bodies and their soul. If her kids want to to play GTA 10, they can save up their allowance for that. If her kids want to start vaping, or move to some kind of cult commune, or run away, then Sally will step in with more harshness.

If her kids end up with quirks that are dangerous, she'll insist on them being educated under hero programs so they can better control them without suppressing them, which given her own quirk is likely.

I am interested to hear how Noah would handle the large amount of kids he wants to have. 
65.
Sally is trying to train her body to automatically load rubber-tipped rounds over lethal rounds and to work on how precise her barrels can be, making them small and tight, going through her fingers for greater accuracy. These can only be .22 caliber at most so far.

Her usual practice is a basic physical condition(Mostly cardio) and target shooting. She has no suppressors on her hands when she shoots, so whenever she's practicing it is really, really loud.
66.
>Casual
Sally isn't exactly on the cutting edge of fashion since even before this she wore her mom's altered hand-me-downs, which were themselves handed down from her grandmother. A lot of her casual wardrobe is retro-looking dresses, skirts, sweaters, and blouses, with some sweatpants and tank tops for lazy days. For shoes, its usually sneakers or flats.

>Special Occasion
Sally has a few nice dresses she treats with extreme care, usually being more revealing, more formal gowns made of light and showy fabrics. She very rarely wears them, keeping them for weddings, funerals, or dates with Noah. As for shoes on this occasion, she prefers a low(1-2 inch) heel and a mary-jane style.

Additional stuff since I forgot some other fashion stuff Sally probably wouldn't notice herself but would subconsciously follow:
-Wears lots of earthy tones(Dark Brown, Olive Green, Yellows, and some dark blues, and a healthy amount of white)
-Wears skirts and dresses over pants despite her rural upbringing, even outside of school.
-Wears minimal jewelry except for her cross necklace. Hasn't had her ears pierced.
-Doesn't like tying her hair up, especially for occasions where she wants to look nice.
-Wears tights in the winter.
-Prefers simple and classic patterns(Plaid, polka dots, stripes, etc.)

Sally would attempt to coordinate her outfits with Noah when possible.

###Kaylee Suzuki HN "Flying Force"
51.
As I expanded on in writefagging, Kaylee is effectively squatting in the Shiketsu exercise center. The place (according to what I wrote) has a "main" building above ground that is massive in its own right, but expands underground into a sprawling center for every form of training the students may need. Don't know how you want to put that onto the map. 
53.
If you're in pain, fight harder! This isn't some introspective wisdom, Kaylee is quite emotionally stunted and wouldn't even consider that there could be emotional pain.
54.
Kaylee has no idea when her birthday is, she has never had anyone who cared to celebrate it, so she has never done anything like a birthday or anything.
57.
There's obviously her activity as a Villain. Aside from stealing and damaging some property, worst she did was probably take hostage and/or suspend them from somewhere. 
58.
Water.
Kaylee can't afford anything else.
60.
Ribs. she eats the bones
65.
Rather straight forward, lots of weight training! Being a mutant is cool because it means not being reliant on external factors for power, but it also means that physical training and quirk training are almost the same! Downside is that she's maxed out the school's equipment, even the stuff designed for super strength, so she's having to get creative (strapping even more weight to things.)
For ki training, I did a lot of it in a writefag with Jugo, but it switches between using as little ki as possible for actions to maximize results, and generating as much ki as possible, to maximize output. I figure that ki generation and physical prowess are connected, so the weight lifting also contributes to the ki training.
Finally, there's always quirk training via battle!

###Hifumi Takeda HN "Warp Blade Hero: Challenger"
51.
As mentioned before, Hifumi lives in a Minami Ward in a small apartment complex by the Kamo River. Pic related is the type of thing. Takeda live on the upper floor, in the unit at the very end of the hallway. The landlady is a woman in her fifties that is a bit like an aunt to Hifumi; she lives below them.
It's a working class area with a lot of Zainichi Koreans. The place is kinda rough to outsiders, but to locals, it's a rather tight knit community, and you can expect to help your neighbours in a pinch, and are expected to help them back if they need you. There are regularly some events organised like a grill by the river, sports games on the field of a nearby school, minor festivals and such; they aren't sponsored by the government, everyone just pitches in by doing what they can to help set it up.
Hifumi knows everyone in his building as well almost everyone else in the neighbourhood.
They don't have a newspaper subscription. 
52.
I initially tried to group people up, but in the end, I decided to pick a custom one for everyone (though it wasn't easy to find both something fitting and that could work as a ringtone, so at times I was unsure, if you have a better pick, I'm open to suggestions):
Hifumi's ringtones: https://controlc.com/de80bf63
53.
Well, depends on the reason for it.
You're physically hurt? Go see a doctor (the Doctor is pretty great).
Have you fucked up somehow and now regret it? Get better at whatever it was so it won't happen again.
You just got a bit stuck in your head? Go do something fun or work out to get it out of your system. "Lift heavy rock, make sad voice quiet" typa deal.
Those don't fit? Go talk to someone, maybe they can help you solve it, or at least support you emotionally. Do you wanna talk with me about it, Bro?
55.
Impakt. He's a real hero. Brave, strong, leaps into action, but also takes time to interact with his fans. Seems like Hifumi could learn a lot from him. (Well, first choice would be Endeavour, but he's too far away.)
59.
Hifumi would probably be the butler that cheers his master's a lot, and gets into fights with servants of other families over whose masters are superior. 
Hifumi X Hailey would become a forbidden romance of a butler X the young lady of whose family he's serving.
60.
for Hifumi it'd probably be some variant of barbecue, but that's expensive so he probably doesn't get to eat it that often. Considering the circumstances, Korean barbecue would probably be his favourite (intensified lately, cause it reminds him of Hailey and he might eat it with her, but in his neighbourhood there is a large Korean minority, so there could be a base in that). I never had it so I can't with full confidence pick one dish out of it, so at semirandom I'll point out Galbi.
61.
Hopefully I won't contradict anything I said before, but I'll expand a bit in Hifumi's answer.
Speaking: probably a quite strong accent that's a mix of Kyoto and Osaka dialects (the latter developed somewhat artificially to sound tougher) with very strongly trilled Rs. Sometimes oddly soft sounding Kyoto dialect phrase can slip in. Also uses quotes often. Overall a rather stereotypical Yankee voice. Unless you want to get into dialect specific sounds, you can just take the voice of Metal Bat from OPM or some other yankee character I guess.
Singing: not terrible, but more guts than skill like I said before, and he likes going to karaoke with friends so had some time to practice. If I'm to point out something somewhat similar, then I'd go with Nagabuchi https://youtu.be/tpH2vwXKOSw
62.
>How would your character intend to raise any potential child of theirs?
Try to help them find their dreams and assist them in their path to achieving it. Probably gonna put a big value on physical exercise anyway, cause "mens sana in corpore sano" and that's always useful.
>How tolerant will they be of their kid(‘s/s’) personal decisions?
Pretty tolerant. As long as they have a dream (and it's not being a villain or something of this tier), then he'll support them.
>What kind of politics and virtues will they try to instill into them?
To always try your best, give 200% effort, and follow your dreams.
>Will they raise their child(ren) based on their sex/gender?
By default yes, trying to instill manly
virtues in sons, and feminine ones in daughters (or rather leave that to his wife). But that's more just an assumption that that's what they'd like. If the girl turns out to be a tomboy, he's gonna be okay with it.
>How strict or lenient will they be with them?
Probably more "pushing them or succeed" when it comes to forcing them to go to training even when they don't want to, doing their homework etc. He'll drag them there even if they throw tantrums. Probably not really strict when it comes other stuff like a polite language etc. In those cases it's more sit down and have a talk and understand why they do that and try to get across a point why he believes it's better to do something else, but not really force them to do it (unless Hay forces him to force then, but then it'll probably be "Your Mom is telling me to tell you to do xyz" and getting a lecture about it from her after)
>Any career path they’re going to force them into?
Does forcing them to choose a career they are passionate about count?
>Or perhaps they’ll be absent/deadbeat parents to them?
NO! 
63.
This is a difficult question, since he's not an expert on laws. Something about bigger funding toward rehabilitation programs? Or more quirk use/safety classes outside of hero courses? Maybe when people are more used to them, the prejudice against villainous quirks will be lessened? All those sound kind of risky, so dunno free lunches for kids. 
64.
Not sure if it counts as merchandise, but a movie, or like a show where he interviews people from the film industry. Other than that probably pretty normal stuff. Maybe a helmet replica for kids, or a line of custom shinai.
65.
I think I've answered this before, but it was probably long ago so why not.
I'll focus on explaining slightly less obvious drills for training Hifumi's quirk, but of course there are also stereotypical exercises like using it for precision, speed, difficult circumstances, in conjuncture with training unique style and so on, but practically everyone has those.
There is a couple categories of useful slightly more unconventional drills:
-To help with teleporting others, the drills based on some CIA stuff used to identify targets (or that's what he was told by one of the teachers). Like shown an image of someone for a split second and has to point out the most important characteristics of that person. Includes learning to spot them, quickly recognise and recall them. Also lessons on short "interrogation" to help him get to know someone better in a short dialogue, that could for example be useful to speed up identifying someone to teleport them out in rescue missions and such. Also basics of drawing facial composites.
-As above, but focused on locations. A similar picture-characteristic drill is present. Shown a picture, has to retell the most important parts. Reproducing blueprints from memory. Etc.
-Concentration drills, very stereotypical ones
-Anti-shock drills, so he doesn't accidentally open his eyes when spooked
-Other drills for memory, spatial imagery and such, like solving Rubik cubes while blindfolded (or just without looking, sometimes does it in class under his desk)
66.
Since it's so important, but i'm one of the anons that doesn't know shit about fashion.
Hifumi wears cheap clothes focused more on being comfortable rather than the looks. Usually he's either in uniform, sportswear or something else casual. The biggest fashion part is just that it's usually "yankeefied" a bit, because thatt's cool.
Nowadays also wears whatever Hailey gives him, so he's mixing bargain bin stuff with some expensive brands I guess.

###Bobby Samson HN "Sunlight Man"
51.
Bobby is in a small apartment with his mom. I'm not where where that'd be besides not the nicest side of town. 
52.

59.
I can't imagine Bobby being very good at this. He's not exceptionally messy, but he's far from tidy and organized. He'd also find the work painfully dull. He has some basic cooking skills due to him helping his mom, but I just don't seem him putting much effort into this sort of work.
Insert cliché scene of Minnie deciding to sunbathe whenever he's out cleaning the pool or doing the landscaping. 
60.
Bobby likes a good bacon cheeseburger 
61.
Bobby is smooth on the dance floor, but I don't think he has much experience singing. That's kinda boring though, so I'll say there's a greater than 0% chance he randomly sounds like one of these guys:
https://youtu.be/k-HdGnzYdFQ
https://youtu.be/Gru4IfbKlfU
64.
>"Hey, kids. Sun Man here. After a long day of stopping bad guys, there's nothing I like more than the refreshing flavor of Sunkist orange soda with real orange juice. Sunkist: Drink in the Sun!™"
65.
Bobby's quirk training is not really a solo venture. He leans heavily on the varied quirks and abilities of his friends to expand the power of his own quirk. There are things to learn from all of his friends, and training together allows all parties to improve much more rapidly than they would have on their own.

Beyond that, he inadvertently trains his quirk almost all the time, since he passively absorbs solar radiation. To the point of having to be told by the Boys to conserve his stored energy instead of constantly using it to empower himself. The result of this is that Bobby is able to "fill his tank" extremely quickly, and he has quite a large tank to work with. However, his historic avoidance of his quirk means more active, intentional empowerment is significantly less efficient and consistent. His lack of control at the start of the year meant he'd often fail to tap into his full storage capacity, or he'd burn through it way too quickly for stunted buffs to his strength and durability (less bang for his buck, essentially.)

His time at Shiketsu has resulted in great improvements in these things, however. Regularly using his quirk at full capacity, as well as pacing himself against people with a lot more quirk experience have significantly improved his understanding of his quirk's limits, like locating a muscle so you know to actually flex it when you exercise. This has helped him further expand his capacity and better control his output, so it's both more potent and more efficient. Instead of always burning the candle at both ends, he's built a larger candle, which burns much more slowly and shine a lot brighter. Of course, there's always more to improve upon.
66.
Bobby can't afford anything high-end, so his style is pretty simple. His typical outfit is a plain white/black/colored t-shirt and jeans. In the summer he'll wear board shorts or regular cotton shorts with probably a 7"-8" inseam since he's tall. He doesn't get anything tailored, but he has a decent eye for what fits him, and he'll just get slight color variations of that same brand/fit when he finds something that looks decent. He doesn't really know anything about fashion, though.

###Inigo Myoga HN "Dragon Hero Ryu-kishi"
51.
Inigo's neighborhood is deep in urban decay and economic decline. It used to be a street full of sake breweries and tea houses but the neighborhood never recovered from a large fire. Now most of the buildings are abandoned or perpetually mid-renovation.

It's a fairly loud and lively place full of misfits who wouldn't fit in in normal society. There never seems to be any police patrolling the area, but those who live there knows it's one of the safest places in the city. Inigo's uncle, Taizo, protects this area as one of his territories in Kyoto. Petty crime is heavily disallowed by his gang. They own a couple of underground izakayas and illegally-run apartments here. A common thief taking the newspaper would quickly be found and punished.

Inigo lives in one of these unregulated apartment complexes, which could only be accesed through a back door. A narrow alley lined with traditional wooden structures and lanterns leads up to it. It serves as cheap housing for college students and part-timers. 
52.
He only had one of those old untraceable disposable phones before leaving his clan. Inigo would've been very excited to get his first smartphone. He'd have lots of custom ringtones, he likely has one for all his friends.

53.
Late night gaming binges and skipping school the day after to go to his favorite beauty salon. He'd get the full spa treatment: shampoo & scalp massage, hair treatment, manicure/pedicure, facial mask while he vents to the women there about what's troubling him. They really like him there.
54.
His family doesn't celebrate it and he didn't have close-friends before moving to Kyoto. He just celebrates alone with his quirk, he usually finds something fun for him and Gigan to do like spraying faces on village statues, or trying to get all the cows to sing him happy birthday. His brothers did use to sneak him presents, like a new VN from Luccione and a big complicated book from Sazuo. One time they managed to take him out drinking.
55.
>Popsy
Inigo's first pick. I'm interested in what tomfooleries they could create with their imagination-based quirks. I already elaborated on this in Rosethorn's last questionnaire. From what I wrote, he's a superfan of hers. It'd be a little embarrasing, if his classmates saw all the Popsy merch in his childhood bedroom. Although it's kinda like a "Never meet your heroes" thing for Inigo. He never even realized it was her in the beach episode, despite the fact that he was in her car. Even when the villain attacked, all he knows is that Popsy showed up, saved the day, refused to elaborate, and left.
>Smokin' Sexy
Is it cheating to say that he's tied for first place? I originally planned to join his dojo, I was halfway through the fic when doki doki yoru and the beach episode threw my plans through a loop, but that's part of the fun with MPs. I think this is the main hero path for Inigo, to find a hero mentor he could respect and learn from. Learning Kenjutsu would also give him discipline and improve his random fighting style.
>Desolator
Inigo already likes The Five and hangs out with them. He respects the hell out of the dude, and could study alongside Junichi in the chance that he becomes a student. Plus I was hoping to look into their connection with Miracle and interact with Christopher's backstory a bit. This is definitely a villain path though.
>His own father
This would maximize his dragon training, and get some legacy storylines happening, it's also a villain path. Not a lot of interaction with other builds with this one.
>Impakt
Bobby and Hifumi's training with him I think. It'd be sweet to join them for some The Boys(tm) summer shenanigans. Unfortunately, Impakt's more of a battle-hero and Inigo's training to be a rescue hero.
> Midas
I just really like his hat and his style. He could teach Inigo some proper leadership skills. 
56.
'Thanks for entrusting me everyone! There's so many to choose from.. but there's only one real choice!'

If he had to pick, he's taking the class to Paris during Fashion Week. Culture is important. He'd try and convince the others to try on the fancy clothes and maybe go on the catwalk for the audience. With their fancy new duds they'd go to the Louvre for some nerd stuff, then see a romantic opera at the Palais Garnier, followed by shopping on the streets of the Tuileries District.

When evening hits, it's off to a Masquerade Ball at Château de Versailles for a night full of intrigue, blooming romances, and temptations. (As a side story for the OVA, they stop the master thief Karma, who's trying to steal a priceless artifact during the event.) 
57.
Not counting the multiple terrible things he was forced to do growing up. Inigo went into a rage and attacked his clan, sending his two brothers to the hospital, and killing several clan members. He just went room to room taking people out. He barely remembers the event or why it happened, but this was the incident that got him kicked out and sent to Kyoto to live with his uncle.

Aside from that, he did a lot of petty theft and was a general public nuisance before Shiketsu. Also, he didn't take his shoes off when he entered a house one time.
58.
Inigo, The Five, and Junichi are having a Mecho Corez 12 tournament at his apartment. We're waiting on Desolator to bring us our drinks from Wcdonalds. Inigo ordered a large Smokin' Pepsi. They might mix the drinks with vodka and sake.

What're the cops gonna do? Arrest us for underaged drinking? 
59.
Inigo would go all-in. He grew up around servants, and knows the protocols and duties required of them. Gigan could cook, while Inigo cleans and decorates. Pleasing female guests would be his main specialty. He'd be the over-protective type, who might seem goofy but is competent at his job. I imagine he'd be the kind of servant the mistress would have a lot of inside jokes with, and is basically your best friend and main confidante. They'd laugh and gossip as she shares the story of her terrible arranged date with him, while he brushes her hair before bed. All the while, he had a team tailing the date the entire time to make sure she's safe. A forbidden romance would grow between them. Lots of will-they-won't-they moment as they try to hide the socially-unacceptable love affair.

Nice prompt. I'll take this as a sign that we're making a Maid / Butler cafe for the school festival, and it to the list.

Any diamond-in-the-rough beauty would do, so he could improve their lives and help them fit into elite society, so maybe Sally or Kaylee. Stylistic pick would be Hoge, for that servant of evil vibe. Bonus points if he dies for her. 
60.
Inigo's favorite food is the anmitsu from his hometown. Matcha warabi mochi anmitsu, made with mountain ice, dragonfruit, apricots, and seasonal fruits from the clan's orchards. The chewy warabi mochi has a subtle bitterness that matches with the cold fruits and jelly. He has good memories of getting the dish as a reward after grueling clan training with his brothers. They shared one portion and it was enough to get them through another week of training. The dish is good for all seasons but the anmitsu in Kyoto just doesn't compare. The servants prepare it so it's always waiting for him back home whenever he visits, but he doesn't eat it.

Gigan's favorite food is roasted sweet potato but it's not allowed to eat them, especially after midnight. I think it starts turning into 4th dimensional objects while high on the stuff. 
61.
Unless he actually takes a song seriously and practices, Inigo is mediocre at singing or dancing. He makes up for it by being loud and over-confident. He gets way into karaoke, as it's one of the syndicate past times that he was invited to often while growing up.

I'm watching it right now, so his voice is like Sawamura from Ace of Diamond. VA: Ryōta Ōsaka https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pUV7uyFX0Q

Hm, that's a tricky one. He would proclaim a new holiday called "Inigo Day", it's like a second valentine, where you're forced to spend the day with your beloved. Those who are single have to spend it with other single bros, or go on a government run blind-date for free. Those who can't go on dates and don't have any bros, will be matched with other loners.
64.
Inigo would have a line of hair and beauty products and designer brand suits, all with red ties. He'd be a little jealous that Gigan's plushies are outselling him. Gigan's kinda like Kirby in a way in that you can just keep selling plushies in different forms or have it wear different hats. 
65.
Imagination is key. Inigo reads a lot of roman, greek and medieval books (he likes the ones with pictures) cause Gigan's tech tree is kinda stuck around there, and simpler modern stuff. He's tried making a light bulb a couple of times to see if it'll light up, but it hasn't worked yet. He's missing something important that keeps him from making more advanced constructs. At night, Inigo would try to drain all his stamina by rapidly changing Gigan's forms. This causes him to pass out for awhile, it's also a type of exhaustion where you can't even imagine anything in your head anymore. You're just dulled out and burnt out to even imagine a single shape.

Experience and building a bond with [Noble Dragon] is very important since the quirk comes down to blind trust most of time. Inigo knows that if he jumps into the air, Gigan would make a platform before his feet lands, and then he can jump again to another unmade platform. If he reaches for a bar, a bar would appear, etc. He trains this by just going wild on skateboard combos or by speeding through the urban jungle like some sort of mad acrobat which trains the quirks' reaction time.

For the bond, Inigo does a lot of things to appease Gigan like doing good deeds around town. It's kind of a hard balancing act cause he's also doing Yakuza stuff at night. Despite that, they pretty much grew up together so their bond is very strong already.

>What's your fashion?
1920's Italian Mobster style which he tries to incorporate to any outfit he's forced to wear.
>What kind of clothes do you wear? 
His clothes consists of a two-piece suit consisting of jet-black or charcoal gray trousers and blazer with constrasing buttons, broad shouldering, a tapered waist, and wide lapels with velvet lining. The blazer is usually unbuttoned with the sleeves popped back.

Underneath the blazer, he wears a crisp white cotton shirt with an upturned collar.

For footwear, he wears a pair of well-polished leather boots reaching mid-calf with his trousers rolled back and tied in a backwards heart-knot just under his knee.

For accesories he wears a silken red-tie, two small silver loop earrings on his left ear, and dragonstone chain jewelry around his neck and wrists, which he makes himself.
>What style, what type?
All his clothes and accessories are made with Australian merino wool or Italian leather. They're tailor fitted and of a designer brand, although all knock-offs. His family has someone with an Item Replicator quirk and he gets his suits shipped to him every other month since they tend to get damaged in battle.
>Have you ever thought about why?
His outfit stems from his childhood obsession with running away, going to America to find his mother, and joining the Mafia.

His silver ear piercings were initially worn as an act of rebellion against the clan dress code. They are not his only piercings.

The dragonstone bracelets and necklaces reminds him of home.
>And does it change for special occasions?
- If he wants to be very casual, he'll just put on a gray hoodie with dark jeans or slacks.
- At home he's usually fine with just a concert t-shirt and shorts or boxers. Only Junichi's around anyway.
- When it's really cold he'll put on a dark blue single-breasted topcoat over his suit.

Orochi trains her quirk by pushing herself to the limit. She has regeneration, so she uses it while training to rip her own muscles drawing 100% of their strength, something that shouldn't be adviced or even thought if you were someone withoout regeneration, making her gain muscles and strength quite fast at low expense since she has something many don't: Regeneration.
So gains that would take months or even years, she can achieve in hours, days or at worst, weeks.
And this leds to her body becoming stronger by coming together again, as she also trains other things besides muscles, as well as her bones due to possible bone fractures made by excessive strength and so on.

So even if she gets damaged in the process, she can always go and tap into her 100% or 110% physical capacity without fear since she will just heal herself if it somehow damages her too much.

###Nyoro Hoge HN "Maru"
51.
Marumaru lives in a dorm-style residential building marketed towards rōninsei that are cramming for re-taking entrance exams. It has very small rooms and a large shared bathroom on each floor. The space is usually quiet, because everyone is a loner focused on studying, and the residents know each other by sight but there's little socializing. There's just too much shame involved in their situations.

Meeting outside the building by chance, people are calmer about it, and might go out drinking together or blowing off steam. But it doesn't get carried over.

All of Hoge's neighbors are much older than her, having graduated high school. Normally she wouldn't even be allowed to be a resident, but strings were pulled and names were dropped, so the rules have been bent in her favor. She's taller than most young girls so even in the unlikely case someone took notice of her, other people living there would mostly just assume she has babyface and move on with their lives.

There are strict housing rules about when you are allowed to do laundry, how you are to keep common areas, specific curfews, and restrictions on noise levels. Unusually for this kind of facility, the maintenance of the place is actually good, and there's insulation between the walls so that common everyday sounds don't bother other people. The building is older though and was retrofitted for this purpose. The skeleton crew that staff the building all live in underground suites.

I admire the philanthropy and intelligence of Rescue Ray. Someone with such good standing in the community would be a benefit to learn from and be associate with, and I feel that because he is not combat focused that I can be an effective asset, albeit temporarily, to his operations. Of course, this is just my personal first pick. I would accept most any internship that specifically recruited me. It would be wise to accept a professional's discernment - if they selected me then they must have a good reason.

Huh? We already live in Kyoto. Everyone comes to us for field trips. Ummm... make everyone go to the most historical district. I've already been to all the shrines, though. If not that, then a train tour through the mountains...?

(Why am I being asked? This is a pain...)

Koicha prepared at 80°C and served in a handleless white ceramic cup with black speckles. Because the bitterness is too intense and she can't afford sweet snacks every week for bites between sips, she dusts it with powdered sugar before drinking. This is the only time in the week she has matcha but the exactness of the preparation routine is comforting to her.

Don't ask her to do a tea ceremony. She would short circuit on doing research and all the decision points of the preparation phase. If anyone went off script during the four hour event itself, she'd definitely cry. Drinking green tea a little bit wrong in her own bedroom is more her speed.

Keeping rhythm? Godlike. Making a fool of herself, in the original spirit of karaoke? A natural. But if you're asking how good she is at singing, then either it's so quiet that it's a disaster or it's so toneless that it's a disaster.

Going down the rabbit hole!

Hoge would undoubtedly be a tiger mom, even though that's more of a Chinese thing. She'd encourage her children to be the best they can be at whatever they are choosing to do, no matter how petty the goal or impossible the dream. Because of how she is, she'd privately look down on any choice her children make that she can't understand, but would try to show up for them in it as long as they were giving their all for it. Hoge has long accepted that everyone besides her is a giant weirdo with unfathomable motives, so whatever her kids want as far as style and hobbies and so on, she'll readily accept. But if you're going to be a genderbent cybergoth juggler it better be the most genderbent cyberest goth juggling master this country has ever seen. (Or as close to that as your talents can manage.)

At the same time, she's very sensitive to the effects of stress, and stress illnesses, because of her quirk. If they're smart like her, then her kids will quickly pick up that an easy way to manage her perfectionist style encouragement is to play on that. Hoge might even overcompensate in the other direction and be doting and unobtrusive until she can sense that resting has turned into atrophy and lost opportunities.

She's trying to be the opposite of her neglectful parents, which is not the ideal parenting style either. Because she honestly wants her kids to be better off than she was, though, it's possible to convince her of other ways to act, but those other ways will always be a struggle against her impulses.

(If any of her kids had one of her interests or dreams, it would be impossible for her to hide the inevitable favortism. It all circles back to her core of loneliness.)

Actually, can Hoge even reproduce? The other anons had it right, I don't know if genetic material can last long in Wasuremono's passive state. Any of her children might be actual vat babies. We already established clones/half-clones are a thing.

Merchandise, merchandise... it should be something people use and look at every day, or there's no point to it... eto... branded fountain pens?

As part of going to sleep, I do mindfulness training and meditation development. It feels impossible right now, but I've read that ancient shinobi were able to control the rate of their heartbeats directly, and I may be able to use this to consciously activate and deactivate the worst of my Quirk. I'm sure Wasuremono is uncontrollable, but the precursors to its activity could be.

At the moment this is the slowest development in my training. Usually my thoughts are too loud and too many to control in meditation, and whenever I make any progress I...

I fall asleep....

I'm tempted to make an actual list of Hoge's wardrobe. Maru doesn't have the confidence to dress in bright colors, and keeps to undyed fabric, browns, and grays. She also likes dark, rich purples, but keeps that color to accent pieces like small details on a garment or purple silk ribbon. She's the type to get swept up in certain clothing trends if they promise to get you attention, but it never works so she owns several really flashy pieces that don't get worn and she's too embarrassed to get rid of.

She doesn't like clothing that lacks pockets, but she also doesn't know how to fix or make clothes and so can't add them herself. So many of her blouses and all of her pants and skirts have pockets at least big enough for her whole hand to get into. She doesn't wear jeans because they feel too stifling. All of her clothes let air through and don't restrict her movement, because she would get agitated and change immediately if it did. She's also the type that gets uncomfortable when her outfit is 100% girly, so if she's wearing a skirt then she wears something like an unadorned tshirt and man's windbreaker. Lately, her ratio for comfort has been getting more and more skewed towards girlier clothing.

She dresses yuppie and conservative for the most part. There's this blouse she owns with chest ruffles to make it look like she has boobs, for example, and she wears it buttoned up completely even to the collar around her neck. She has harem pants, but they don't have mesh panels or open slits in them. Etc.

Except for her school clothes and the couple jackets she owns, most of her tops don't have sleeves. Except for two exceptions, her skirts are at least knee length.

The Marumaru costume is full coverage though, obviously.

Hoge owns her uniform shoes, fuzzy slippers, rigid black boots, geta, and open sandles that tie on the leg with ballerina ribbons. Because she's a dork, nearly all her socks are tabi, and she wears them inside closed-toe shoes as well.
