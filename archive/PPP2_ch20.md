#### Containers and Iterators
>*“Write programs that do one thing and do it well. Write programs to work together.”* —Doug McIlroy

*"This chapter and the next present the STL, the containers and algorithms part of the C++ standard library. The STL is an extensible framework for dealing with data in a C++ program. After a first simple example, we present the general ideals and the fundamental concepts. We discuss iteration, linked-list manipulation, and STL containers. The key notions of sequence and iterator are used to tie containers (data) together with algorithms (processing). This chapter lays the groundwork for the general, efficient, and useful algorithms presented in the next chapter. As an example, it also presents a framework for text editing as a sample application."*
