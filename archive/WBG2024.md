**/wbg/ - Waifubot General \#**

PREVIOUS:

NOTICE: This thread isn't for the pozzed of heart, and thus by posting in here you irrevocably denounce the talmud with your heart and soul, and you also profess your hatred of the antichrist.

SUMMARY:
Waifubot General is meant to inform and discuss the idea of Waifubots, artificial companions who can fulfil the roles that women traditionally filled, roles they have abandoned in the wake of feminism. We hope that with this upcoming technology we can force women to a standard not set by themselves or by the globohomo, thus undoing the past century plus of feminism.

!!! Note Regarding Denouncements
    The most important part of a denouncement is the first portion, namely the "by posting in here you irrevocably denounce the talmud". Beyond that,   you can be creative with the denouncing. Just make sure that talmud part in particular is kept in, otherwise people will think you're a well-poisoner/JIDF agent.

    Some alternate denouncements are as follows:
    - ...and thus by posting in here you irrevocably denounce the talmud with your heart and soul, and you also irrevocably agree that troons smell like shit.
    - ...and thus by posting in here you irrevocably denounce the talmud with your heart and soul, and you also irrevocably agree that feminism ruined society.
