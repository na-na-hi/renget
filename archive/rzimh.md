####I. Byakko-Ikkai Syndicate Compound, Osaka
>Recommended listening: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGc23Acr3Ms
It's been exactly two days since Luccione's capture. The festival wasn't the only place Luccione and his allies had attacked that night; at least a dozen high-ranking syndicate members were dead. The other yakuza families were the main targets. Inigo had testified in front of the clan's elders and they had given Kaz a swift sentence. Yet something felt off about it. Like a VN with only two choices which both lead to a good route. It was too easy.  Luccione's allies were still there. Gathering in Kyoto. Waiting. Inigo couldn't let them hurt any more people.

Dry tears stained the folded letter tucked away in his blazer's pocket. Hiro's formula had done the trick and revealed the whole message. Pulling the paper out, he read through it again for the 20th time.

!!! note Revealed Letter, First Half
	Hey kid. If you're reading this- then I've run out of luck and I'm out of the game. My money's on Kaz or your uncle. Remember the place we went to when you sprung me from the Red Hats? You wouldn't shut up about some movie date. I hid away some documents there. Everything I could gather from my time working the street. All about Taizo, Kaz, and their partners. The list has big players like Suzaku and Byakko Ikkai-

His eyes fogged up before he could read the second part. He yawned fighting off sleep that would come if he gave in for a few delicious seconds. 

*BUMK BMMK!* 

The black armored car jostled through the unfamiliar compound's gates and a series of speed bumps. Men wielding semi-machine guns watched from their sentries.

Sitting on the driver's seat was a petite man, with gentle features in formal wear. Though a salt and peppered hair suggested he was 70-something, he stood with the ramrod stiffness of a much younger man. "We're here," the driver said. 

The blonde teenager, wearing a neatly-pressed black suit and a red tie, took a deep breath and moved to exit the unmarked vehicle. A miniature green dragon landed on his right shoulder.

"We should wait for backup, sir," the old driver suggested.

"I got this. Please stay safe, Shoji-san."

-> ![The flames felt cold.](https://i.imgur.com/N0sXGCI.png) <-

Minutes later, flames rose around him as the young man walked back to the car. Behind him, the building's roof caved in and collapsed. The men that were inside fled.

The car's door opened and the weary teenager slipped in. He slumped over with his head low. He held his chest and hissed through gritted teeth.

“You’ve been shot.” the driver said with concern. 

“I’m fine. Bullets didn’t make it through my armor.” He reached for the first-aid kit under the seat.

"I take it, negotiations went well, young master?" Shoji-san said. 

"Byakko Ikkai will stay out of Kyoto."

"Ah, good." The car started. "A phone call came for you while you were busy."

"Who was it?"

"Shie Hassaikai sends their regards about Luccione and your father's retirement."

"Ah. Tell them thanks.” He groaned as he bandaged up his chest. “And that I hope to see Eri soon."

"Very well." 

The driver paused.

"They'll open the gates. Don't worry."

Shoji-san nodded, "Where to next, sir?"

"Can you take me back home, Shoji-san? I need to visit my friends in the hospital." He closed his eyes and allowed himself to breathe easier.

The gate opened. The men on the walls kept their weapons drawn, holding their fire with bated breaths. 

As the compound disappeared from view, Inigo recalled Gigan back to his side. Blood coated the miniature dragon's fangs.

!!! note Revealed Letter, Second Half
	You'll find their plans for Japan and the international syndicate. It's up to you now. Sorry to push this to you. I'll buy you a beer when you get here to make up for it. This is the last time you'll hear from me so forgive me for getting sentimental. Truth is, I would've retired a long time ago but I wanted to watch you grow up to be the person I knew you could be. Why do you think they sent you to Kyoto? Look how that turned out. Call it a favor to your mum. I know she'd be proud of what you've become. You two have the same heart and the same smile. Good luck being a hero. You carry that grin through all of it, ya?
	
	-your friend, Jenkins

	PS. Your mum’s still alive. The trail's cold, but maybe you'll have more luck than me in finding answers.

He watched the flames from the Byakko compound get smaller in the distance. He'd been away from Kyoto. Right now, he should be there celebrating the aftermath of the Summer Festival with Hoge, instead he was here putting out Luccione's fires. And starting new ones of his own.

####II. Central Kyoto

In the bustling city of Kyoto, the sun shone brightly, reflecting off the vibrant colors of autumn. Inigo jolted awake as the car hit a pothole. He yawned and rubbed his eye. Gigan mewed at him as it uncurled on his lap. "You fell asleep too? I told you to wake me up early, buddy."  He took out his phone. 

"Did you sleep okay?" Gigan mewed and hopped unto his shoulder. It opened its mouth wide.

Inigo chuckled and patted his dragon. "Okay, buddy. We'll get some food soon. I still don't think you actually need to eat." 

He grinned and looked out at the familiar buildings outside the car. He could almost see Shiketsu Academy from here. Today was the first day of September. Classes would start again soon. 

He checked his phone and saw he had 1 message.

It was another message from Fight Man. He grinned and quickly typed out a response. He wondered how his class had been doing. He pulled up the class' groupchat on his phone.

He smirked and closed his phone. He couldn't wait for the next semester. He felt better already. 

"Shoji-san, we there yet?" he asked while he straightened his tie.

"Apologies, young master," the driver said, "I'm afraid we're behind schedule. Traffic hasn't moved for ten minutes."

Inigo busily combed his hair using Gigan as a mirror. He was still really really ridiculously good-looking. He shot finger guns and winked at himself. 

"What's the hold-up?"

"It seems to be some sort of villain attack, sir."

Inigo squinted his eyes and looked through the windshield. In the distance, he could see a thin plume of smoke rising into the clouds.

"Alright then." He opened the car's door and started to stretch. Gigan transformed back and ran up Inigo's arm. The chill of the morning air ramped up his excitement. "Thanks for the ride! I can make my own way from here, Shoji-san!" he replied. 

"My orders were to see you home safe, young master."

"I am home!" Inigo shouted as emerald wings unfurled from his back. With a running start, he took to the skies and saw the city in its entirety. He caught an updraft and allowed it to send him soaring past the clouds. Cold wind whipped through his hair as he shot towards the distant danger. As all heroes should.

As he flew, his thoughts drifted back to the last few days.  The news of the epic clash between the local heroes and the infamous Five had spread like wildfire, reaching the ears of criminals far and wide. Many of those pro-heroes were now in the hospital, including the esteemed #6, Majestic, and #10, Rosethorn, all nursing undisclosed injuries from the fierce battle. On top of that, his uncle's trial was still underway and the Sahugin gang was all gone, leaving a void of criminal authority in Kyoto. It was a volatile situation. He knew the city's vulnerability wouldn't go unnoticed by the villains lurking in the shadows, especially those from the prior prison break in Osaka.

Inigo followed a trail of broken property and damaged buildings. There it is! 

A thirty-foot tall vine-covered villain, resembling a giant lima bean pod, rampaged through office buildings. Shattered glass and pulverized concrete rained down as it battered buildings with limbs thick as oak trees. 

Far below, Inigo spied the hero Floor battling solo. The local heroes must be spread thin if he's alone. Inigo glanced at distant plumes of smoke, realizing that this was just one of multiple villain attacks happening simultaneously. 

Floor was slowing down the villain but clearly lacked the firepower to defeat it. Worst of all, Inigo could see civilians encased in its massive tendrils, holding them hostage as it stomped about. Office workers screamed, begging to be freed from its crushing grip.

**"Ten-Meter Standing Room!"** 

Floor yelled. His binding quirk trapped the gigantified villain's green foot as it tried to take a massive step. The villain tripped and crashed. Floor quickly moved to help a captured woman get free. Inigo watched as the villain aimed a tree-sized vine at Floor. The vine struck true, sending Floor flying. The pro-hero did his best to shield the woman in his grasp as they struck a wall hard. 

Inigo tucked his wings and dove, rocketing down like a missile. To his surprise, two familiar faces were heading there as well, his classmates - Yui and Noah! They nodded to each other as they sprung into action. In an instant, Inigo's barrier went up in front of Floor, Yui's threads ensnared the vines, and Noah's light beams blinded the villain. They stood in front of the pro-hero.

>Recommended listening: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sM3WYL8JVZ0

"W-who're you three?" Floor said suspiciously, staggering to his feet.

"Floor-sama. Be not afraid," Noah said, with a reassuring smile as his wings spread wide. Bright light shimmered around him. "We are hero students here to help!"

"Yeah! We're a Rescue team! We're trained for this," Inigo yelled through his green knight armor, giving the pro-hero a thumbs up.

"That's right! You can count on us!" Yui called out, her bindings wrapping around her limbs as she took a defensive stance in her crimson hero costume.

The monstrous villain slowly rose to its full height.

"Let's go! Remember what Localoca taught us. Saving civilians comes first!" Inigo called out. He flew up and charged. His emerald shield enlarged to block the creature's lashing limbs. He shot between the monstrous vines, slashing with an oversized claw gauntlet to free the entangled civilians.

Yui's threads shot out like lightning, weaving a web around the creature's flailing limbs. She heaved and yanked the threads forward causing the monster to tilt dangerously. Civilians fell from its grasp.

Noah with remarkable agility darted through the villain’s attacks, he caught the freed civilians in mid-air. "Hostages secured!" Noah called out as he moved a woman a good distance away from the fight.

Floor, battered and worn out, walked forward slowly. He cracked his knuckles."Appreciate the help, but I started this fight, young heroes - and I won't back down!" With the civilians safe, Floor leaped into the monster and struck unfettered at its lima bean core. He rained down punches and kicks. Hundreds of hours at the gym and sparring with Impakt had allowed him to master his strikes. 

*5, 10, 20 strikes!*

Inigo couldn’t keep count as Floor attacked with blinding speed. The monster groaned, lashing out wildly at nearby buildings and vehicles. Giant lima beans shot out of its pod, crushing walls and vehicles, and nearly hitting Yui as she swung away on a thread.

Inigo flew to reinforce a struck store full of shoppers with his quirk long enough for them to flee. From the corner of his eyes, he could see Yui's bindings snapping as she worked to replace them. 

Noah yelled in pain as twisting vines crunched at his white wings. Floor severed the vines with a kick, freeing the angel boy. They continued their assault.

Their coordinated effort was working, but the creature was fighting back. Each step it took sent shockwaves through the ground, and the buildings around them trembled dangerously. They were in a race against time, knowing that the longer the battle dragged on, the more innocent lives hung in the balance. Inigo's mind raced. What could he do? He watched the final civilian flee from the building he was holding up.

"We can't keep this up forever!" Yui cried, her voice strained. Floor's voice boomed from the midst of the chaos, "I've got an idea, kids! Keep it distracted!" Inigo nodded and ran next to Noah, "Leave it to us!" They both yelled in unison. 

**"CRASH KICK!"** **"EMPYREAN BURST!”**

An explosion of light and an enormous soccer ball slammed into the villain from the side. It was dazed.

Without hesitation, Floor gathered his quirk for a gambit. He drew his full energy.

**"Twenty-Meter Breaking Room!"** 

A sharp vibrating noise shot up into the air. The monster started to slowly slump and then one by one its limbs crashed into the ground as if pulled by an unseen magnet. It was held down and pinned. "I can't keep this up for long. Where is he?" He said, yelling into his communicator.

"Look over there!" Yui yelled, pointing up at the sky.

Right on cue, something shimmered high above them.  A figure plummeted from the sky.

**"KNIEVEL..."**

Impakt fell rapidly. The pro-hero's signature drop kick crashed down on the beast with the force of a meteor strike. 

**"... ABSSPRUNG!"**

The vine monster groaned loudly and toppled like a felled oak, office windows shattering around it. The bean pod had snapped and broken, smashed into a hundred pieces. Floor released his quirk and wavered from his lack of energy. He smiled, "About time you got here." In a flash, Impakt was by his sidekick's side, holding him, "You did great fighting him for this long. Leave it to us." 

“Impakt-sempai..” 

They gazed into each others’ eyes for a moment. 

Turning towards the monster, Impakt charged. Inigo, Yui, and Noah rallied around him with their own attacks. 
***
***
 With the villain  subdued, Impakt turned to the students, bloody but beaming. 


"YA-HA-HA-HA! Excellent work, young heroes! But no time for praise - there's another villain in Quadrant 4! You're not in trouble. But leave things to the Kraftwerk Hero Agency from here on!" He moved to collect the weary Floor and pressed on his earpiece. "Copy that support! I'm on my way!"

With that, they blasted off in a blur.

The police quickly moved in to collect the villain. Inigo and his friends made their escape up one of the rooftops overlooking the battlefield. Inigo smiled ear to ear, he had only seen his classmates briefly during the summer festival and they hadn't talked since the summer break. As soon as others were out of earshot. He hugged his friends from behind, adrenaline still pumping. "Guys! Haven't seen you two in rescue gear for awhile. That was crazy! It's so good to see you two!"

 "Hey! Watch where you're touching!" Yui yelled in jest, "Seriously, it's been way too long. I missed kicking ass with you losers."

Noah smiled, "Noah as well. It gladdens Noah's heart to be united with friends once more."

Inigo kept his arms around their shoulders. "We definitely have a lot of catching up to do! How were your summers?"

 "I trained a bunch and got way stronger. Also punched a lot of dudes," Yui replied.

"Noah went on a short mission trip and helped many in need."

"That's awesome! I had to deal with some messy family stuff, but I'm just glad to be back hanging with my buds," Inigo grinned. "Man, I can't believe we ran into each other during that madness!"

"It's been non-stop random villain attacks over the past week. They seriously popped up out of nowhere," Yui said with annoyance.

"Yes, Noah had come out to help. Unfortunate events have befallen our fair city of late.. Just last week, the church food bank was robbed by ruffians. Noah was most distressed by the crime."

The three of them watched the lima bean villain get dragged into a big police truck. 

"That's crazy. Any idea where all these new villains came from all of a sudden?" said Inigo. He had a few ideas, but he wondered what they knew.

"No clue. The police are stumped too. It's like someone kicked over a trash can and released all the vermin. Me and Noah have been running ourselves ragged responding to all the incidents," Yui answered, kicking a rusty can off the roof.

Inigo fluttered his wings and ascended, "Well, at least we'll get our whole class back together soon. Let's clean up these streets once we get our licenses!"

Noah cheered, "Quite right. Justice shall reign again soon enough! We'll correct their misdeeds and show them a better path."

"Hell yeah! I'm ready to crack some skulls. You wanna come with us to Thanks A Latte?" Yui asked.

Inigo shook his head, "I'll take a rain check! I got something to do! I'll catch ya guys later!" Waving good bye to his friends, he flew off into the sky.

One thing was clear - they were going to have an interesting start to the new term!

>Recommended listening: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lC_tfsmdDYo

Light rain drizzled around him as he flew down the lonely road. His thoughts were a turbulent storm as he gazed out at the scenery near the city limits. Inigo looked at a nondescript building across the street. It was a safehouse for the Five, and it had taken him some time to find them. He had doubts about meeting the notorious group again, but he needed to see Junichi. After a moment’s hesitation, he crossed the street and entered the two-story structure.

A disheveled man in an arm cast allowed Inigo into the building. The safehouse interior was dim and sparse. He made his way into a small infirmary inside. There were a dozen beds arranged in a row inside the gray-tiled room. Four of the beds were occupied. Inigo froze in the doorway at the sight of his friend. Junichi was pale and drenched in sweat, muttering deliriously in his sleep. He was surrounded by rundown medical equipment. He wore a thin white hospital gown, and they had removed all his piercings. Inigo couldn't stand to see his friend looking so injured and un-edgy.

“It’s not looking good,” Maddox said from her place at Junichi’s bedside. 

"Still sleeping huh?" 

Inigo moved inside. His throat tightened. Junichi looked so much worse than when he had visited Christopher in the hospital with the others. Christopher was already sitting up, talking and laughing with visitors. If they knew what he did, the media would praise him as a brave young hero. But Junichi was hidden away here, suffering. And he would be condemned. It didn't seem fair. They had both been trying to protect someone. Why would one get praise and glory while the other got...this? Inigo swallowed hard. The world wasn’t black and white and sometimes there's no bad guy, but who gets to decide that?

Inigo sat quietly by his friend's side. He placed a lunch box and a small "Get Bearter" bear on the bedside table. He had taken some time to place an earring on the bear and glue paper-mache bone spears on it. Gigan floated above Junichi with a worried expression. 

Maddox sponged Junichi's forehead with a damp cloth. “He’s got a bad fever, kid.  And there could be permanent complications if he doesn’t wake up soon. I'm worried her might take a turn for the worst.”

Inigo leaned in inches away from his unconscious friend, "I'm here, bro. Sorry it took awhile." He smiled weakly. "Your hair's lookin' shabby by the way. You gotta wake up, okay? I need you to wake up and tell me if you scored with Max during the Festival. Or y'know... tell me to shut up and yell at me. C'mon... Please...." 

He placed a hand on Junichi's arm. He was deathly cold. Junichi's breathing was harsh. He muttered soundless words in his delirium.

"Fine, be a grump and don't answer..."

Inigo sighed and turned to Maddox. 

"Hey, about that girl you fought. Kaylee."

Maddox furrowed her brows, "How is she doing?" There was a hint of concern in her deep voice.

"She's in a coma right now. She's not doing too well. I thought you guys didn't kill kids?"

Maddox frowned exhaustedly, "She picked her battle, kid. It looked like she could take my hits until I hit her with my Bull's Eyes. Then she started freaking the hell out? Like I gave her brain damage or something.."

"That doesn't sound like her. She doesn't freak out in battle, even in the tournament-"

"She didn't even move. She started muttering nonsense. Something about a baby and the void," Maddox shrugged. "But my team needed me, I couldn't take the risk of her rejoining the fight so I took care of her."

"You could've held back.. or restrained her."

Maddox chuckled quietly. "I did hold back. Stupid girl reminded me of my kid sister. Running off into every fight thinking she could take on anyone."

"You have a sister?"

"I did." Her voice was cold and she shot him a serious look. She didn't want him to press on. He turned his attention back to Junichi.  

"Thanks for being by his side. Did they bring a doctor around?"

Maddox nodded slowly, "He's done all he could with what they got." There was a note of grim hopelessness in her voice. How can someone so powerful, seemed so shut down. The Mad Bull was a big softie and he felt glad that she was around. 

Rain leaked into the room from holes on the ceiling. Inigo glanced at the other three injured in the room. He didn't know who they were, but they were likely men who were wanted by the law. The room was cold and damp, not at all like the legendary Koseikai Takeda Hospital. This is where people went when they had nowhere else to go.

*“Leave it to the government to hide advanced medicine from the rest of us. Saving it for their privileged heroes.”* Junichi's previous words echoed inside Inigo's head.

“Hey Maddie, can we get my family’s healers to see him?” Inigo suggested, "There's these two women."

Maddox shook her head, “Too risky with all the heat on us. We can't even get out of here.”

"We have to do something. Anything," Inigo muttered in frustration. "Where's Sam?" 

Maddox shrugged. Inigo felt anger building inside him. Desolator wasn't even here. Was he gonna leave Junichi to die?

Inigo bit his lip and rose to his feet, fist clenched. “I’ll see what I can do. I might be able to get us help. Please make sure he eats the curry if he wakes up. And I hope he likes the stuffed bear.”

Maddox smiled softly, “We’re here for him. He’s not alone.” She patted Inigo’s back.

“Thanks Maddie. Call me if something happens, okay?” Inigo said. With one last worried look at Junichi, he departed the house and ran into the pouring rain outside.

####IV. Upscale Apartment

Inigo approached the upscale apartment building, rehearsing his pitch. The doorman eyed him suspiciously until Inigo flashed his Shiketsu ID card. "Top floor, penthouse suite," the man said, letting him inside. Inigo rode the elevator up, checking his reflection in the mirrored walls. Stepping out, he was startled by the two bulky security guards stationed by the elevator door. She really was guarded 24/7.

Taking a breath, Inigo knocked on the suite's door. After a long wait, the door creaked open, to reveal [Aura Curie](https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/thread/88229867/#88231609) in a silk robe, hair wrapped in a towel. Behind her, the apartment was dim but tidy. Inigo had met the 2nd-year support student early on in the school year when his attempts to woo support girls had failed explosively. She had healed him with her quirk and he had done his best to make it up to her. She had always seemed odd to him, like she was constantly worn out. Even for a 2nd year, she was seen as a small celebrity in Shiketsu, though she never seemed to have any friends.

"Oh, it's you..." she drawled, leaning against the doorframe. 

Inigo waved. "Hey Curie-chan! Still under maximum security huh? You're looking... great."

"Ugh, cut the crap. I look like shit." Curie hiccuped, taking a big swig of a nearly empty bottle of wine. "Got tired of ignoring me?  What d'ya want?"

"So, funny story, I was hoping you could help my friend with your quirk? He's pretty banged up, and—"

"I knew it," She groaned, "Save it. I've heard all the sob stories before." Curie staggered back into her apartment. 

Inigo followed gingerly. He had only been inside a few times. The once immaculate apartment was trashed, curtains drawn, piles of takeout boxes in the corners. Curie collapsed dramatically onto the couch and let out a weak belch. "I'm sooo sick of everyone begging me to fix their problems. You know it's a stockpile quirk, right? For every one I save, there's another I'm not able to help." 

Inigo perched nearby. "I know, you must get asked a lot being so talented." He tossed an empty beer can off the couch.

Curie groaned into the cushions. "It's the worst. I wish I could just live in peace..."

Inigo nodded sympathetically. He was very worried. This was not the charming yet quiet senpai he remembered from his first semester at Shiketsu. Her depression had gotten worse. Gigan started tidying up the place as Inigo patted Curie on the back. "I'm sure you're doing your best. Believe it or not, I've seen worse. You should see my place after a gaming marathon.” He looked around. “How about I make you some coffee? Then we can talk." 

Curie bolted upright, swaying. "Actually y'know what, screw that! Let's party instead. Wooo!" She cranked up some loud music and started drunkenly dancing. The loud speakers made the room shake.

"Oh, uh, maybe we shouldn't—" Inigo tried to protest. "C'mon, dance with me!" Curie grabbed Inigo's hands, spinning herself around wildly. "Isn't this fun?" 

"Yeah, fun," Inigo said quietly, getting dizzier by the second as he swung with her. Eventually, Curie tipped and began to collapse. He grabbed her to steady her and helped her onto the couch, his heart sinking. He couldn't ask a favor when she was like this. He glanced at his phone. If he split now, he could hit up the Doctor or that fresh faced nurse, Emilia. *Hey there, Shiketsu medical crew, mind hopping over to the Five's secret spot? My pal could use a patch-up.* He'd cooked up crazier schemes before. 

Curie began to rouse, gazing at him quietly. Her eyes, a mix of silver and blue, looked like they'd been through a war – bloodshot and baggy.

"It must be hard dealing with people's sickness and injuries all the time," Inigo said wistfully as he stood up.

Her haughty manner slipped. "It is. I wish I could help more people. But I get used up so quickly. And I'm left alone to deal with my decisions." 

“You do save people though, that must be nice, right?”

"Uhuh." She gave him a blank look. "I've also had to let a lot of people die because my power was spent. You just see them all pleading in their last moments for help… and I can't always help them." Curie's face showed the weight of this knowledge, and her eyes were red with tears that wouldn't fall.

“Yeah that'd get me too. Is no one else around? It’s shitty that you’re alone like this.”

She shrugged, “I used to have a lot of company. One by one, I drove them all away.” She looked out the window and stared off into the distance.

“Hey. I got kinda busy with other things.” He rubbed the back of his head. “That’s why I never visited again. I'm sorry,” Inigo frowned at his lame excuse.

“Whatever,” she muttered as she flung herself to the other side of the couch and produced another bottle of wine. She took a long swig. “You’re here now. For your friend. Not for me, but for your friend.” She laughed loudly.

Inigo sat down next to her in silence. It’s not like she was wrong. It's not like they were in the same class. He just figured she had other people. He felt like a huge jerk. "Hey, I put you on the spot showing up like this. I'll get out of your hair. You have my number if you want to talk." 

He started to rise but Curie shot up and pushed him back down. She leaned in close, studying his face. A small smile crept onto her lips.

"On second thought, how tall are you now?" She spread the fingers of one hand over his chest.

"Huh? 184 cm, last time I checked for a suit." He stared up at the ceiling.

"You'll do nicely," She said with a purr.

Inigo raised a brow. "Uh, do nicely for what?"

"I have a gala to attend tonight and my date ran out on me. It’s a big charity for medical research. Come as my date, keep away the crusty old lechers, and I'll heal your friend after. Deal?"

Inigo blinked rapidly, "Right! Y'know I'm not exactly singl-"

"Purely professional, of course," Curie added, slightly annoyed. "So what's your answer?"

Inigo smiled optimistically, "Yeah, works for me." They shook on it. Inigo wasn't sure what he was getting into, but for Junichi, it’d be worth it.

Curie laughed, "Excellent. Pick me up at seven sharp then," She winked.

She adjusted his tie. "And wear something nice."

####V. Annual Koseikai Takeda Charity Gala

Inigo stepped out of the limo and gazed up at the dazzling sight before him. Spotlights waved through the night sky over the massive art museum hosting the gala. Men in tuxedos and women in glittering gowns strolled up the red carpet toward the glamorous event. Turning, Inigo extended a hand to help Curie out of the limo. 

"You look great," Inigo said with a wink.

"Why thank you, kind sir," Curie replied with amusement. "Remember, you're my date tonight. So look handsome and pretend to adore me."

"Of course, my lady," Inigo gave an exaggerated bow, making her laugh. He offered his arm which she took with a smile.

As they walked inside, Inigo marveled at the lavish decor. Priceless paintings adorned the walls while ice sculptures dripped down an ornate dessert table. A full orchestra played on a grand stage, accompanied by a soulful jazz singer. Inigo tugged at the collar of his dark gray suit jacket and placed a hand in his pocket. Gigan, sitting inside his pocket, nipped at his fingers. 

*Wish me luck, buddy. Hope this is a short party.*  Beside him, Curie shone like a gem in an elegant white evening gown, already scanning the wine table. She looked like one of the frost ice sculptures in her all-white outfit. He was surprised at how well she cleaned up.  

Inigo noticed many familiar faces - his friend Noah sat with his family and Sally at a table, the Korean clique sat on a private table of their own, and various other schoolmates and pro-heroes were scattered about. Hiro and Orochi waved them over from a table near the back. He and Curie moved towards them.

"Fancy meeting you two here!" Inigo said to Hiro and Orochi, "Who knew we looked so good outside of our uniforms?"

"Hey Inigo," Orochi grinned, wearing a silver gown that matched her hair, "Pull up a seat, we're at the kids table since we're still in highschool."

Inigo pulled a seat up for Curie before taking his own, "Hey you guys know, Curie, from the support course."

Hiro nodded in his dark blue tuxedo. "They sent you an invite too? I figured they sent one to all Shiketsu students with potential in medicine. The new recruiters have gotten worst this year." 

Curie motioned for one of the waiters to bring them a bottle of wine, "Don't remind me, Endless Horizons' staff has been a real pain since the Shiketsu tournament. They won't stop calling me."

Hiro shrugged. "I don't mind the free food."

A group of waiters served them the first of a five-course meal. "Otoro sashimi and caviar with freshly grated wasabi, yuzu zest, and gold leaf," the head waiter said to their table before the waiters all bowed and left. 

The four teenagers busied themselves chatting as they ate, keeping an eye on the extravagant party around them.

"Didn't expect to see you two together," Inigo looked up from his food at Hiro and Orochi. 

Orochi took a sip of her drink, "I'm here with my cousin." She gestured towards the tables at the head of the party. 

Various pro-heroes mingled there. Inigo recognized the pro-heroes: Seiryu, Honoken, Slipstream, Magnum Shrimp, Flamingal,  Rescue Ray, Localoca, Impakt, and Floor amongst a throng of lesser-known heroes. The first two wore signs of their injuries from their battle with the Five. "It's a photo-op to reassure the public that everything's okay. That pro-heroes are on top of everything," she explained.

"I don't blame them with all the villain attacks lately," Hiro said pensively.

"Yeah. It's been a pretty wild summer. You'd think villains never rested," Inigo watched the table full of pro-heroes.

He took note of all the cameras and photographers on them. This was the other side of the gloomy dark halls that the syndicate and the Five were used to. To him, the heroes were surrounded by light. Seiryu was flanked by two young actresses as he spoke to an interviewer. Impakt gave a thumbs-up to a photographer as his agent passed out business cards. Even Localoca posed for a group of admiring young men, some of whom were quickly escorted out by security. Inigo caught the attention of his favorite rescue teacher and they waved at each other.

"Even outside the battle, they're still doing their job for the public. That's going to be us one day, exciting stuff right?" Inigo said.

"Yeah, I can't wait," Orochi said, rolling her eyes as she chewed on her food. "I'd rather be at the arcade, where people leave me alone," she said half-joking.

"Don't forget, one of us is support," Curie absentmindedly moved pieces of her food on her 5th-course plate. "Those in the support team are lucky to get recognized behind the pro-heroes they help out. All the work and no glory really."

"Exactly why I'm in the Hero course. They did try to move me into support when I got held back. The Principal revoked the punishment once she heard Rescue Ray offered me a transfer," Hiro replied.

"Did you try out for the hero course too, Curie-chan?" Inigo asked curiously, as he swallowed a bite of his wagyu beef with a truffle glaze.

Curie took a swig of her wine glass and brought the empty glass down on the table with a thud. "Yep! Not heroic enough. I don't have it in me. I panic too easily.."

Inigo flashed a grin and placed a hand on her shoulder. "I think you're more heroic than you think, you save and help people every day."

"Thanks- I uh-" She looked up, flushing, likely from all the wine she's had. She saw the Doctor and Emilia from Shiketsu's nurse staff waving at her. "We have to go meet with someone. It's a medical thing. Excuse me." She stood up abruptly and left.

"Right? I'll be here!" Inigo said, standing up as she did. He watched her leave and disappear into the crowd. He sat back down to amused looks from Hiro and Orochi.

"Sooo.. you two huh?" Orochi said, smiling like the chesire cat.

Inigo narrowed his eyes, "I'm only here as a favor to her, purely professional."

"Suuuure," she teased.

"Please don't make me beg not to tell Hoge-chan. I don't want to distract her before the exams. Cause I will beg, openly, and I can get very loud," Inigo threatened.

"I got your back, man," Hiro offered a fist-bump.

"Thanks bro," Inigo returned the gesture.

"I won't say anything if you don't. Not like I want rumors spreading about Hiro and me," she said matter-of-factly.

"I'm right here.." Hiro said.

"Ouch." Inigo winced. Even Gigan mewed in protest from his pocket.

"You knooow I didn't mean it like that! Why're you getting defensive for?" Orochi accused, raising a finger. "Cause ..uh.. I dunno." Hiro looked away, feeling lost. Inigo burst out laughing.

"Good evening students" 

Inigo and Hiro looked up and saw the tall blue-haired dragon hero: Seiryu, sporting a black tuxedo with a blue rose, as he approached their table. He rested his hands on Orochi's shoulders. Cameras flashed behind him.

"Good evening!" Inigo said with a grin. 

"Hello sir," Hiro said cooly.

"What is it?" Orochi said looking up.

"I'm here to introduce myself to your friends. We have an opening at my agency if any of you would like to join Orochi for your internships." Seiryu said in a smooth rehearsed fashion. 

"Thank you Seiryu-san for the offer. I'll definitely consider it," Hiro said with a polite nod and bow. "Yeah, that goes double for me. I'm a big fan!" Inigo replied, beaming. Orochi seemed bored.

"That's great. Now if you excuse me, I'd like to borrow my cousin for a bit. Come on." He offered a hand to Orochi, who took it impatiently. The two walked away to meet with a group at a different table.

Inigo turned to one of the tables at the front of the party.  A tall dark-haired woman with W-shaped golden earrings caught his attention, she was between two men with expensive looking tuxedos. "Hey Hiro, you go to these places a lot, do you know who those people are?" He nodded towards the table. The large table was flanked by bodyguards and servants.

Hiro looked up from his food, "Hmm? Yeah, I've seen them before, a couple of big shots. That's Baberu Kōgō, she's the CEO of Endless Horizons, the guys she's with is Eugene Kurtz and Kazuma Oomori, both very wealthy businessmen. Why do you ask?"

Inigo smirked. "No reason. They look spiffy." All three of those names. They were in Jenkins' documents, although he had forgotten their significance.

"Well, looks like both our dates ran out on us." Inigo said, grinning. "Think I'm gonna mingle a bit. Catch ya later, man."

"Yeah, see you. I better check in with some people too." Hiro answered promptly. 

Inigo left the table and walked into the crowd, wondering what awaits him at this fancy gala.
