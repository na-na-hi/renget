!!!note if you don't want to read all of this, please read at least the part about leveling and the 160 wall
[TOC2]
#####What server do I choose? is there a difference?
All the servers have the same content and started at the same time
Choose the one closest to you for ping purposes, "Global" servers are in Europe
#####I just started, do I reroll? and how?
That's up to how much time do you want to invest, but having top tier units at the start of the game will make the campaign smoother.
You can reroll with salted emails, they disabled guest accounts because the chinks were nuking the servers
Emulator is recommended if you have a beefy PC because you can have multiple instances going on at the same time
You get a guaranteed SSR on the tutorial pull that can only get you a character from the SSR units from launch, so no newer units nor Pilgrims
Then you have to clear a bit of the campaign to unlock the mail and you can claim free gibs, the amount will differ based on if they are running some sort of promotion or reward
#####Pilgrims?
Pilgrims are extra rare units that can spook you on any banner but have a lower roll chance than other SSR
Getting Scarlet or Modernia will set you up for most of the campaign
#####What are all these tickets? which ones do I use?
There are 2 different tickets, blue for the Ordinary Banner and shiny/LGBT for the Advanced Banner (limited)
![Ordinary](https://i.imgur.com/p64Zn7d.png)![Advanced](https://i.imgur.com/kxZk4oN.png)

The blue ones you can use as soon as you get them
Advanced tickets you should save for a unit you really want, they can be used on any limited banner and do not expire
Gems should be generally saved for the Advanced Banner unless you are desperate to get past the wall (more on that later)
#####I'm clearing the campaign but I ran out of resources and can't level up, what do I do?
Before you unlock the Outpost, a building that gives you resources passively each hour, you'll get most of your XP and credits from claiming challenges on this menu on the top right ![Click on the !](https://i.imgur.com/5wgBTPK.png)
#####What are these boxes with hours in them? do I have to use them before they expire?
![Boxes](https://i.imgur.com/i66UMHT.png)
No, those boxes give you the amount of resources that your outpost will give you in the time specified on the box
####When do I open them then?
Every 5 campaign stages you clear your outpost will level up and give you more hourly resources
![Outpost level up](https://i.imgur.com/xkWjF9S.png)
Use them when you get stuck on a stage and you'll get some outpost levels out of it to make it worth

Open dust boxes to get past the milestone levels (60, 80,100...) and just the exact amount you need
####A train just obliterated me. What's going on?
You just found your first EX stage.
![EX stage](https://i.imgur.com/LvyxyxP.png)
Those are special stages that appear as you progress the campaign on which the level of your Nikkes is synced so you cannot overlevel them.
Gear, Skill levels and attraction stats still count so you can come back when you are more powerful, they don't block your way

####How do I make a good team?
First, units are categorized by the number and cooldown of their burst (third skill)
![Burst numbers](https://i.imgur.com/IWeGac8.png)   designated by roman numerals, for the cooldown you have to click on the skill to see them   ![Cooldown](https://i.imgur.com/broFIE1.png)

The more generalist team consists of a B1 with 20s CD, a B2 with 20s CD, 2 B3 units and a flex spot
![Example team](https://i.imgur.com/SiF7ZYA.png) Like so

The flex spot can be a healer, another B2 with 40s CD, another dps that doesn't burst but grants buffs when others burst (Privaty, Drake), etc.

When building your team take into account that while on auto the units burst from left to right, so order them with that in mind

####These are my units *(insert picture here)*. Who do I level up?
You can level whoever you want at the beginning and progress with that, just make sure you can full burst like they showed you on the tutorial

Now, this is important: depending on the number of dupes of a unit you have, they can get to a higher level
For example this is a SR with 2 dupes (LB2) and a SSR with 0 dupes (LB0)
![SR LB2](https://i.imgur.com/toV782l.png)![SSR LB0](https://i.imgur.com/ugEjZNd.png)
As you can see the SR can get up to lvl160 but the SSR only to 80
!!!danger THIS IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT, YOU NEED TO PLAN FOR THIS FROM THE START OF THE GAME
To be able to get past lvl 160 you need a SSR unit at LB3, that means getting that unit 4 times
And you need 5 units at LB3 or you'll be stuck at lvl 160 for MONTHS/FOREVER
You will see this commonly referred as the 160 wall, and the anons stuck there as walled
I'll explain more about the wall after, now we continue with the leveling
After you beat stage 4-15 you will unlock a building called the Synchro Device, and it looks like this:
![empty sync](https://i.imgur.com/uHyko77.png)

The device automatically takes your 5 highest leveled Nikkes and lets you sync other Nikkes to that level
So the play is to reset the units you have been using on the campaign until then, for 10 gems each, and level 5 SR units that you have at LB2 EQUALLY
![Resetting levels](https://i.imgur.com/H7cuG0a.png)

You get refunded all the materials except skill manuals, so be careful about that. You can get up to this point with all the skills at level 1 so you can take your time leveling skills until you have a broader understanding of the good/meta units (or someone spoonfeds you)

As you can see on the picture the 5 of them are lvl 40 so our sync level is also 40
That means that we can put other SSR (or SR) units that we want to use on the spots below and they get leveled for "free"
![filled sync](https://i.imgur.com/wc6rTpZ.png)

You can get more slots for the sync for free on the Tactics Academy (another building) up to 20 or paying 500 gems for each one
![Academy lessons](https://i.imgur.com/iA1I4Z7.png)![Paid slot](https://i.imgur.com/jTq029e.png)

Taking a Nikke out of the bottom spots incurs on a 4 hour cooldown until you can use that spot again
![Cooldown](https://i.imgur.com/PYXAS37.png)

Again, level your Nikkes evenly. It will result on a higher POW for your squad
![Even vs Uneven](https://i.imgur.com/JmBc6XS.png)

####So, what do I do about this 160 wall thing?
The game has a couple of systems in place to "help" you beat the wall

One of them is the Wishlist. It unlocks after you make 40 rolls on the Ordinary Banner
![Empty Wishlist](https://i.imgur.com/ZLnYTpz.png)

This lets you narrow the pool of units you can roll on the Ordinary Banner to 5 of each of the main Nikke manufacturers (you cannot wishlist Pilgrims but they can still spook you on the banner)
You should add every SSR unit you have at the beginning in hope of getting more dupes of them, but you won't have 15 of them until a while so you can fill the rest of the spots with meta units or the ones that make your dick tingle

Second one is the mileage tickets
![Silver Mileage](https://i.imgur.com/CkgsVnY.png)
This is a spark mechanic, after you do 200 pulls on the Ordinary Banner you can buy a spare body (dupe) of some Nikkes that appear on the mileage store
!!!warning This does not unlock new Nikkes, you can only get dupes
These are the units that can appear on the mileage store, every day at reset one of each column is present at random
![Mileage store](https://i.imgur.com/ppMaQQG.png)

Not every unit is there and the only Pilgrim that appears is Noah, so plan accordingly
!!!warning DO NOT BUY A SPARE AS SOON AS YOU HAVE 200 MILEAGE, WAIT UNTIL IT'S THE LAST COPY YOU NEED TO GET UNWALLED
You never know what you'll get while rolling or from a mold, the last thing you need is an extra dupe that doesn't help you get past the wall

Third one is a spare body selector
You'll get it for free when one of your Nikkes reaches lvl 141
![Selector](https://i.imgur.com/Pn01aoc.png)
It has more units than those that appear on the store, you can check them by clicking on it on the challenges tab
!!!warning SAME AS MILEAGE, DO NOT INSTANTLY USE IT

####What do I buy from the General Shop?
Get your freebie and dip, you'll unlock a free reset down the road for 2 freebies a day
Sometimes buying Battle Data is worth if it's heavily discounted, it can get you a couple of levels if you are very stuck on the campaign, but your credits should be going into the Academy lessons and leveling your Nikkes
Never ever buy gear or things that cost gems
![General Shop](https://i.imgur.com/46V8eFK.png)

####What do I buy from the Body Label Shop?
Only High-Quality(gold) molds, never ever RE-Energy or consoles. Even if they are heavily discounted
![Body Label Shop](https://i.imgur.com/asU6Q65.png)

####I did some coop, what do I buy from the Recycling Shop?
Get the gems and raw credits first, you need a very high outpost level for the credit boxes to be worth vs raw
![Coop shop](https://i.imgur.com/yx7xrvp.png)

You can get more dust with your remaining currency, starting with the 2h boxes as they are a bit cheaper
And no, those tickets are not for rolling Pilgrims, they are to get affection

####There's an event going on. What do I farm on the repeatable stages?
The answer is Core Dust
You may think that getting XP or credits will help you get more powerful faster, but there are several levels that require core dust to get past them (40, 60, 80... you get the drift) and not having the dust ready can stall your progress for days because the outpost generates much less dust compared to credits and XP

If you can clear the hard stages buying the extra entries for gems is absolutely recommended, you get a huge amount of boxes
![Entries](https://i.imgur.com/ZlUrwcV.png) The item changes every event but the concept it's the same

There's a google sheets linked on the OP that you can use to see exactly how much dust you need for each milestone
Also, past level 200 every level is a core dust wall so you'll never have enough

####What are these free prisoners I see people talking about? How do I get them?
After you clear stage 5-20 on the campaign you'll unlock the elevator on your outpost, inside there's a mechanic called Liberation that lets you "Rehabilitate" the prisoners
It takes around 2 months of doing daily tasks to get one prisoner, and you can eventually get all 3
There's a trick to get more progress after you reach a milestone: you can change your target to another prisoner and then back to the one you were rehabilitating. You'll get a new set of dailies for you to complete, effectively getting 60 points more for free
![Milestones](https://i.imgur.com/VZRlMIr.png) Each happy face is a milestone, so you can do this 4 times

As for who to pick, as of now Guilty is the more PvE meta pick, Quency is good on PvP and Sin is uh... for you to sniff her armpits or something
My advice is to pick with your dick
You can get their spare bodies with the currency for participating in Union Raids

####Do I really have to clear all these simulation rooms every day?
No, you only need to do the hardest one you can and you get all the rewards from the previous rooms

#### LCSMP? what is this Alphabet Soup thing you guys keep throwing around?
Anons referring to the meta units by their initials
LCSMP would be Liter, Centi, Scarlet, Modernia and Privaty

#### Does Gold Mileage expire when the banner ends?
No, you can save it and use it on whatever banner you want
Pilgrim banners are the best ones to use the mileage on because the Pilgrims have 1% instead of 2% chance on focus

#### What happens when I reach lvl 200?
The first 5 Nikkes that you level to lvl 200 get permanently fused to the top row of the Sync Device and you can't remove them (as of now).
![Top row](https://i.imgur.com/g0FCW4I.png)
So if you have many LB3 characters choose wisely between meta/waifus

Every level from then on will be primarily gated by dust and will level all the Nikkes on the Sync by 1
Again, this is why you farm dust on every single event
