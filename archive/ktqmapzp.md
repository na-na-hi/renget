Kita looked down into the room. His eyes followed Tomoki as she was escorted out. Several things had already been made clear.

>(The examiner specified that being caught by the Chunin leads to removal. In other words, the Jonin and Anbu are only here to observe.)

With that realization, Kita could begin to see gaps in the proctor's patrols. Blind spots where only the Anbu or Jonin would be have vision. Kita shot a glance over at himself sitting at the desk quietly. He wondered what was going through his other mind right now.

Kita felt uneasy around this many people, especially with so many observers watching him closely. When Tomoki was dismissed he felt his heart sink. She was an honest sort who was quick to speak her mind. If Tomoki hadn't spoken up first, that very easily could have been Ichika getting eliminated for the same blunder. As his mind drifted to his teammates he started to see the purpose of the exam.

>(They want us to sacrifice ourselves so our teammates can succeed. Finish the mission at all costs. Well I'm having none of it. We're all getting through this together.)

Kita considered taking up a confident pose to ease his teammates minds, but that could just signal to them that he would surely succeed if his teammates sacrificed themselves. Not wanting that, he considered a closed off pose to signal his teammates not to interfere. That too could backfire, as they might see it as a sign that they're on their own and couldn't expect any help. In the end, he settled on his usual neutral pose his squad would be quite used to by now.

>(If they see something familiar, maybe they'll think everything is going according to plan. God I hope they don't do something stupid.)

Crawling along the ceiling on 8 legs, Kita easily committed all 9 questions to memory. After making his way inside a vent he gave one final glance to himself. He was completely nondescript. Just like he always practices.

>(Now it's your turn.)

In an act that only sometimes felt like suicide but always left lingering feelings of existential dread, Kita released the jutsu, dispelling himself and allowing the intel he gathered to be transferred to his original and the other clones he had on standby.

A sentient bucket in a nearby storage closet suddenly gained profound insight.

>(Huh. Good work, me.)

Kita strode into the testing hall with an aura of absolute authority. As he entered, Kita noticed one of the Jonin crack a smile before returning to his usual stoic look.

>(Impressed?)

Kita allowed himself a rare moment of smug satisfaction as he waited for the patrols to get into position. When he saw his opening, he strode towards the center of the room with definite purpose. Stopping abruptly in front of Jin Hyuga, Kita slammed his hand down onto the desk creating a thud that echoed through the room leaving all inside absolutely stunned. Kita stared daggers into the young ninja eyes through the menacing slits in his mask. The terrified Genin opened his mouth as if to beg for mercy. Reacting quickly, Kita did a semi-lunge forward and intensified his already nightmarish gaze. With that, Jin went perfectly still, sweat beading down his head.

>(Don't go talking just yet, Hyuga boy. I don't want you eliminated before Ichika has a chance to crush you.)

With that, Kita simply turned and began walking away, leaving everyone inside utterly confused. No doubt his distraction proved useful to some of the other teams. More importantly, as he was leaving Kita received a knowing look from Ichika. That along with the disappearance of the note he left her when he walked by signaled that the mission was a success. Two out of three members of Team 3 now had all 9 questions.

>(Sorry I couldn't help you too, Masu. I've played my hand as far as I'm willing to risk it. Besides, I have confidence you'll be fine. You're better at this than I am, after all.)
