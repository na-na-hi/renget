>after you all got along so well, it only made sense to crash at Tails’ workshop for a while
>you almost thought about how you created two monsters now but no, it was very much on them
>Sonic was his usual self
>practically glued to your cock
>but since losing his virginity, Tails had become a little tease
>in his own way mind you
>despite the… bad influence he still remained a bit more conservative 
>the fox wasn't as shameless 
>good thing too because you'd probably have keeled over from a heart attack keeping up with multiple Sonics
>for instance, this morning 
>Tails rubbed his backside against your leg
>quietly trying to get your attention
>Sonic decided teabagging your face was the best way to announce he was awake too
>it didn't take long for him to encourage his friend to be more forward and start stroking his cock and yours while the hedgehog tried his best to smother you
>you'd considered yourself fairly open sexually but if you'd told yourself a year ago you'd be having threesomes with talking colorful woodland creatures…
>well you'd find that idea insane
>you slipped a finger into Tails and he whined and clung to you
>his own dick was forgotten as he jerked yours off and rode your digit
>Sonic, not to be outdone, grabbed your hair and frotted against your face
>he looked down at with a smirk as the first load of the day splattered over your face and pillow
>he kept thrusting and moaning even with his cock softening
>Tails was shocked when one finger became two and you started fucking his tailshole harder and faster
>both of them ended up showering you in cum by the end of it and both of them had to clean it off your body with their tongues
>so that was your morning
>another AM shower and some coffee and you were good as new
>you'd noticed Tails was unusually more clumsy and dropping his tools more often
>really started to feel deliberate after the 10th time
>his current project was getting his biplane fixed up
>Sonic was bored and decided nude sunbathing was in order
>no idea how he would get a tan but you felt he just wanted an excuse to get naked on the beach
>he did mention a place called Station Square out the door
>Tails ended up explaining for him while tinkering
>there were humans out here
>but they sort of stuck to one city
>half the time the talk came off as rumors 
>Sonic didn't super speed run off to check out something like that?
>”well, it's supposedly on another continent.”
>he leaned in close
>”that and I think he's not all that concerned about a city full of humans when he has one”
>you sat at a work bench and mulled over that
>could Tails’ plane allow you to check that out?
>”doable. hand me that wrench.”
>he was ass up working on the engine and pointed over to the table
>he had a worn crescent wrench he practically always carried with him
>loved the thing
>he thanked you as you handed it off
>you asked if he needed help
>all this unchallenged leisure was strange
>so why not see if you could do something
>last thing you wanted was to just be a gigolo for a couple of guys
>you couldn't do much to help Sonic run faster but Tails could use a set of hands hopefully
>he dangled his legs and tightened a few bolts
>after a couple seconds of work he finally spoke up
>”well once I get the Tornado in working shape maybe you could be my co-pilot?”
>well that sounded fun
>you didn't feel it was super helpful on your part but at least he appreciated your effort
>he hopped down out of the engine 
>you asked if you should go tell Sonic but Tails waved it off
>”he's probably catching a nap as we speak.”
>that did sound like him
>you'd never flown in a biplane before
>was it safe?
>”oh yeah. she just sustained some damage last time we took it out against Robotnik.”
>that was curious 
>so was Sonic like a sort of super hero when you weren't letting him ride your dick like he stole it?
>Sonic had gone over adventures here and there but a new perspective was nice
>you sipped your coffee and gave him space to check over the plane
>”we are currently on an island. a big one but an island.”
>he guided you over to a chart above the workshop table
>his finger pointed to a small landmass in the scheme of things
>”there's a few villages and my shop here but over here-”
>he continued over to a bigger land mass 
>”station square is off the coast there. can't see it from this side of the island.”
>you were curious
>he caught the look on your face
>”I've never been but a lot of the talk points to there.”
>you commented again how you were shocked Sonic never explored it
>”neither of us has seen a human outside Robotnik. he wasn't a good first impression.”
>well you were happy to dispel their worries
>you pulled up behind Tails a he went over more of the map
>a few other island hopping adventures here and there
>there was a guy strong as Sonic was fast
>you found that hard to believe but you let him continue
>he talked about Sonic having a super mode?
>in a ways you couldn't mentally picture Sonic the way Tails described 
>the two of them had been to space in addition to dimensions
>it was shocking
>and yet Sonic just didn't brag about it 
>the way Tails talked was like a little brother proud of his big sibling
>but you detected something more under there too
>something you had suspected 
>you had to tease him
>your hand slipped over his fuzzy chest and his heart skipped a beat
>he even gasped a little
>you remarked how it sounded like he had a little crush
>Sonic was his hero wasn't he? 
>but more than that
>you picked the fox up and sat him on the table 
>he stammered and tried to avoid the question
>you figured from how Sonic talked about practicing kissing and their closeness it was a mutal thing
>and you gently reassured Tails you wouldn't break that up for the world
>it turned Tails on to have Sonic watch you deflower him
>the way he bit his lower lip told you plenty
>well, you weren't here for cucking
>you murmured that as you kissed along his neck
>you frotted him through your clothes
>you wanted Tails to want you too
>you had suspicions at all the metal Sonics he had “safekeeping”
>they were being worked on 
>not trashed
>actively worked on
>you asked him
>did he love it 
>you didn't want to get in between him and Sonic
>you'd feel like a shit doing that
>he undid his suspenders to allow your hand more access to his fluffy chest
>you wanted to hear it from the fox's mouth 
>while you enjoyed the threesomes, you wanted to make sure there wasn't any bitterness 
>last thing you wanted was to fuck up something that worked fine for what looked like years
>with Sonic out of the room this gave you a chance for a one on one with the fox
>you told him you wanted to make sure you did the right thing here
>he teased you but you needed him to be honest
>you slipped your hands under the fox's coveralls to grip his ass
>you asked, right to his ear
>did he really want you as his co-pilot?
>did he need it?
>you pulled him close and he cuddled up to your chest
>you didn't want to break up a friendship with this and you didn't want Tails pining for his friend from afar
>you figured it wouldn't have been as simple as Sonic saying it was a package deal
>he might be a wild and free-spirited enough for it
>Tails wasn't just some sidekick though
>you wanted to make sure you respected him as a guy
>he finally mumbled and you asked him to speak up
>”thank you,” he replied
>he wasn't just an accessory in all this and you wanted him to know that
>you said as much and he rubbed his face into your chest
>”I had a thing for Sonic but I'm happier this way. plus I don't think I could get Sonic to settle down like you did.”
>was he… promiscuous?
>you didn't want to bring up the subject of a body count but his level of experience made you worry you'd catch hedgehog syphilis more than once
>”no, not like that. he's just got a bad habit of never wanting to stay in one place for too long.”
>he tried embracing you
>”I can see why he likes staying in this particular spot.”
>so Tails really was happy with this arrangement?
>”it took a while to think over the idea but I like this.”
>well you were glad he was happy with a partnership 
>his dick rubbing through his clothes told you his body liked it but you had to make sure his heart did too
>with that doubt hopefully shelved for good you decided to come back to the matter at hand
>well, hands
>you gave his ass a squeeze and he moaned
>the twin tails waved softly back and forth
>he did really enjoy this if those were any indication 
>well you'd love to be his co-pilot
>Tails felt more vulnerable than his friend
>Sonic felt like he could bounce back from anything
>the yellow fox clinging and whinging against your chest felt different
>maybe that's where your concern came from 
>well if he was really OK with it you'd definitely have him too
>”you should have heard what Sonic would say about you.”
>oh?
>”he definitely had some praises for you.”
>the fox fidgeted against you, grinding to meet your dick
>”I liked seeing you…”
>he trailed off 
>but you insisted he finished that sentence
>you hefted him up by his fluffy ass, fingers spreading his cheeks apart
>what did he like seeing?
>you prodded his ass through your clothes and his gloved hands grasped at your shirt
>”I never knew I could like being that dirty”
>well neither did you
>this new life you had going on was eye opening
>you'd always prefered guys and now you had two that looked pretty damn good
>you allowed yourself a moment to appreciate that maybe a gift landed in your lap
>your old life wasn't missed a whole lot
>no power bills or rent here
>not a whole lot to miss over there
>these guys were dangerous 
>if you could stay in bed full time you might take the offer, wanting to feel useful or not
>by now your dick was doing the thinking for you
>Tails whimpered that there was no lube down here
>you'd just make do
>you had set him down and bent him over
>ripping down his coveralls, you could see he was panicking
>but you had no intention to hurt the fox
>his blue eyes got wide when you dropped your pants and pulled down your underwear 
>you let you cock flop down on his ass and you could tell he was nervous
>no lube just meant you weren't going in
>he had enough ass for this
>the feel of his fluff rubbing against your dick was nice
>it was even nicer when you wedged it right between his cheeks 
>the nervous look faded as you grabbed his ass and pushed it tight as possible against your manhood
>you'd show him something new today
>his own cock twitched, reacting to his imagination running wild
>you couldn't see that but you did see the look in his eyes become curious
>you fucked his thick ass
>he had a great butt for this
>your cockhead poked out with every thrust forward
>he was getting into it, watching you rut him 
>eventually his hand snaked down to his own dick
>his other hand rested on the work table
>this was a good compromise
>not quite nutting in him but you'd both get off
>your fingers gripped at foxmeat as you kept running your shaft over his hole
>Sonic was right about both of them being bottoms
>Tails stroked himself as he watched over his shoulder
>he'd gotten his first actual taste of being with a guy and clearly liked it
>hotdogging was new to you, sure you'd heard of it
>but you'd never indulged in that particular act
>it lacked the tight warmth of actual anal but it was still good
>gliding over Tails’ hole earned you a whimper
>he loved the attention
>and you were happy he was happy
>clearing the air earlier felt necessary 
>you'd have to make sure to get alone time with the two of them in addition to threesomes
>no reason to make neither feel like they were left out
>it was weird to think about
>how this all started with punishing Sonic’s bratty ass
>now you were worried about the feelings of two guys
>this was definitely a partnership now
>you fucked into Tails and he thrust back occasionally 
>his hand stroking his own rigid cock as his orgasm approached
>surprisingly, you came first 
>maybe because you weren't slamming it into his prostate 
>or his hand just wasn't as fast
>you frosted his ass like a cake with a groan and he watched 
>it didn't take him much longer to reach his own orgasm
>he shot his load onto the floor as his knees buckled
>you were there to brace him though
>you took a moment to relax
>with your heads clear, Tails spoke up first
>”want to take out the Tornado now?”
>but shouldn't he clean up?
>he slipped on his coveralls and started over for the plane
>”smelling like you isn't so bad.”
>the fox got to work fueling the plane and you wiped up his mess with a shoprag
>well at least he seemed happy with your current arrangement 
>you scribbled a quick note for Sonic
>he was smart enough to put 2 and 2 together but you felt like it was rude to just dash off without saying something
>this scouting run would be quick
>you were still kind of shocked neither Sonic or Tails had checked out this city themselves
>as much as Sonic seemed to… enjoy your company
>he made no attempt to check out a city of humans before meeting you
>maybe that Robotnik did leave enough of a bad impression on them
>you wondered just how bad the guy could be
>with all the preliminary flight checks in place, Tails signed off on the Tornado's outing
>he tossed you a pair of goggles before donning his own
>you had to adjust yours, no doubt they were usually intended for Sonic
>you realized the plane was a one seater
>you asked how that would work
>”you first, then I sit in your lap. Sonic usually likes riding on the wings but I don't think you'd like that all that much.”
>well you didn't share that quality with the hedgehog, that's for sure
>so he planted his ass in your lap and you buckled both of you together
>this was going to be a distracting flight
>you'd flown maybe twice in your life
>not in anything like this biplane
>the hangar doors slid open and the runway seemed so short 
>but you had faith 
>nervous as you were you were I capable hands
>Tails flicked switches on the console and the engine whined to life
>the rumble of the machine had Tails jostling against your crotch and goddamn was this going to be distracting
>the take off was smooth
>you couldn't see his face but his body language was confident 
>he knew what he was doing in the air
>he wasn't boasting 
>but you got the vibe he was in charge up here
>your duties as co-pilot seemed to be try not to concentrate on him vibrating against your dick
>you'd just cum but he wasn't helping 
>you couldn't tell if he was doing it on purpose or not 
>probably not for how skittish he was normally
>this was just the easiest way to fly
>the beach breeze felt good as you ascended through the air
>you tried looking down to see Sonic but by the time you were up in the air the beach was distant
>”I'm going to try and push for across the water, see if there's a mainland out there.”
>the fox was shouting over the engine to try and speak
>normally as soft spoken as he was, he'd never be heard over the roar
>his gloved hand pointed towards the horizon, past the island below you
>you saw a few of the little villages dotted across the island and it truly felt small
>it felt chilly up high but Tails made for some kind of insulation 
>this wasn't something off your bucket list but it was an experience you were glad to have
>sure enough, the plane veered towards the area he pointed to 
>you'd cleared over the mountains on the island and he throttled the plane up, pushing the acceleration 
>it was hard to get a good idea of how fast you were going except for the island that was rapidly disappearing from sight
>eventually you were out at the open sea and you could swear you saw movement below you
>was Sonic running that fast?
>maybe you two had made him curious
>hard to say
>you pointed it out to Tails and he swooped down closer
>it didn't take long to see it was indeed Sonic
>just casually matching pace with the plane over the water
>he at least had clothes on 
>even if it was a women's one piece swimsuit with a tropical shirt fluttering like a cape behind him
>you waved
>he waved
>after about an hour, you finally saw land
>actual land
>you took in the sight
>a city, similar to something from earth
>you could see it 
>so the rumors were true
>humans must be down there
>you flew towards the mountains, Tails no doubt trying to find a landing strip
>there was plenty of jungle around 
>hopefully there was something
>just in time too
>you were approaching the point of no return and he didn't have spare fuel
>granted Sonic could just run back
>but you didn't know if he'd remember just where it was
>as easy as it was to get lost out on the ocean in a boat no doubt it would be easier running
>you wouldn't risk either of them
>it was weird to think how they were both growing on you
>Sonic was right
>you did like them
>you liked this life
>as if on cue the second you crossed the mountain and saw some ruins, something shot one of the plane's wings up
>if Tails hadn't made a last minute evasion it could have been worse
>your first biplane flight was turning into your first plane crash
>you wrapped your arms around his stomach while he tried desperately getting the plane under control
>it would be a crash landing in the jungle
>whatever happened you were landing near it apparently
>the violent sounds of the jungle canopy smacking into the plane sounded ugly
>you ducked to protect your head
>Tails kept in control the whole crash landing and kept the plane steady
>his composure here was so different 
>he really was more comfortable here, even in a crash
>eventually, the plane lost momentum and not a moment too soon
>the front of the plane rested in the sands of a coastal beach 
>Tails asked if you were OK and you asked him the same question back in reply
>you both seemed intact, minus three ringing in your ears from all the noise
>you unbuckled the both of you and allowed Tails to hop off your lap
>he jumped out of the plane immediately and you followed him
>shortly after Sonic had curved around the peninsula 
>you noticed the concern on his face before it vanished when he saw you two were safe
>”sorry, I just got a little nervous.”
>the apology was actually sweet
>you never saw him worried
>you weren't in a hurry to get into another situation to see it again, but it was sweet
>he cared more than he let on sometimes
>the hedgehog approached and surveyed the damage
>you were fit enough to laugh it off
>the plane took the brunt of the impact and Tails was a skilled pilot
>you all were lucky though
>you didn't gloss over that fact
>someone shot at you from those ruins
>for now you were stuck in this continent 
>that human city might have the parts you'd need
>it might be faster to split up but it didn't seem wise out here
>Sonic broke your thought 
>”so you and Tails?”
>he motioned a finger through a ring formed with his other hand
>oh lord
>how did he even know
>”I can smell it on you,” he replied with a laugh 
>he kicked the sand with a sandled foot
>”let's go pay whoever shot at you a visit.”
>he was already heading into the jungle
>taking a nice slow pace
>he rested his arms behind his head as he took in the sights
>Tails, a little embarrassed about the earlier question, followed in suit
>you took a look at the crash and then rushed to catch up
