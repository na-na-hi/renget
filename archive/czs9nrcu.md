#When Something Smells, It's Usually the Nuts
***

"Take a seat, Mr Shidehara."

As the fat neckbeard waddled into Karaburan's office, he was quite confused.

"Hm? What's this about, Principal Karaburan?"

The principal was wearing a clothespin on her nose.

"There's been a few... complaints. About your... hygiene."

Kiyoura chuckled.

"Oh, I understand. Yes, it's cold season, right? Got it, no more hugs! Thanks for telling me!"

As he got up to leave, a green smear being left where he was sitting, Karaburan winced.

"Uh... sit back down, Mr Shidehara."

If it weren't for his politician parents, this slimy stinker would have never made it to the school in the first place.

"Oh, of course!"

Waddling back to the chair, his bare feet also leaving green footprints, he sat back down with a **THUMP**.

His fat wobbled.

"You see... you don't smell very good."
"...Huh?"
"Your Quirk. I-I'm sure that it's the only issue."

She was lying.

"But, as it stands... many of your classmates have complained of your stench."
"...Oh."

Covered in boils, Kiyoura began to shake, and tears welled up in his eyes.

"I-I'm sorry... I-I d-didn't r-realize."

Karaburan considered comforting him, but then remembered that she didn't really want to.

"Listen. Before you cry, your parents stepped in. They came up with a little present for you."
"...Huh? But it's not even my birthday?"

Leaning under her desk, Karaburan grabbed a suitcase, and plopped it down right in front of Kiyoura.

"I ask that for the remainder of your... time, here, that you utilize this... Support Gadget."

Kiyoura's eyes lit up.
He grabbed Karaburan's hands.

"Oh, thankyouthankyouthankyouthankyou Principal Karaburan! I'll be sure to not let this go to waste!"

With surprising speed, Kiyoura grabbed the suitcase and opened it up.

Karaburan was getting tissues, soap, and hand sanitizer.

As Kiyoura opened up the suitcase he was, frankly, confused.

A bundle of plastic-y yellow material laid in the box.

It was a hazmat suit.

"Uh... what am I supposed to do with this?"
"Wear it."
"Ah, I see!"

Waddling off to the bathroom to change, leaving more green filth in his wake, Karaburan breathed a sigh of relief.

With a wave of her tissue-covered hand, several janitors came into her office.

"Sanitize EVERYTHING he touched."

Skycarver was having an exercise for the 1-F students. He was told that Kiyoura would be excused for some time, but that he might not come back.

Rob was spraying his nipple goo, Runt was eating dirt, and everyone else was doing whatever else they do.

All was at peace.

"HELLO, FELLOW 1-F STUDENTS!"

Everything was no longer at peace.

Skycarver and the students watched in horror as a yellow blob with the voice of Kiyoura walked onto the training field, looking more bloated than ever.
Holding their noses, they watched as the visor of the hazmat suit completely obscured Kiyoura's face behind a thick wall of green fog.

"...Hm? Oh, don't worry. You shouldn't be able to smell me through this suit!"

Skycarver watched, apprehensively.
He had a duty.
He was going to be the one to test the smell-hiding capabilities of the suit.

Slowly lowering his hands, Skycarver stared down the yellow balloon.

Then... the moment of truth.
He inhaled.
Several students gasped in shock at the outrageous act of suicide.

"Oh."
"He actually doesn't smell."

The other students similarly, 1 by 1, began to lower their hands to sniff the air.

Although, due to some stinky students, it was bad, it was no where NEAR as bad as it is when Kiyoura was there.

"Alright! Now, that I don't smell, it's time to train!"

Waddling over to a dummy, Kiyoura grabbed his helmet... and tightened it.

Then he started boxing, as the class breathed another sigh of relief.

For now... his suit remained steady.
