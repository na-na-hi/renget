### Introduction

In order to farm stigmata and weapons located in the Foundry, you need to have the requisite material. One type of material that is used to craft stigmata is Crystalyte.

Crystalyte have grades: 
- G1 (phantom) crystalyte
- G2 (twilit) crystalyte
- G3 (chasmic) crystalyte
- G4 (pure) crystalyte

G1 crystalyte is used to craft G1 stigmata, G2 crystalyte is used to craft G2 stigmata, and so on.

Crystalyte also have types:
- Ice theme (or Glacial Fences) stages drop Blue Crystalyte.
- Fire theme (or Illuminated Land) stages drop Red Crystalyte.
- Lightning theme (or Roaring Palace)  stages drop Purple Crystalyte.
- Physical theme (or Blade Grave) stages drop Grey Crystalyte.

Here's what each Crystalyte looks like:

- | G1 (phantom) | G2 (twilit) | G3 (chasmic) | G4 (pure)

The other materials needed to craft Foundry weapons and stigmata are listed in the [Foundry Costs](https://rentry.co/hi3bounty3copy/#foundry-costs) section.

### How Universal Mirage Works

In order to obtain ether fuel and crystalyte, one has to farm them from Universal Mirage. Unlocked at captain level 28, and accessed through the Attack \-> Challenge \-> Universal Mirage screen, this game mode provides you with a time-gated way to craft Foundry weapons and stigmatas.

![Universal Mirage Themes](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GUAeSz-Z8R8/maxresdefault.jpg)

As mentioned before, Universal Mirage is split into four different themes, each theme providing a certain type of Crystalyte, corresponding to the color of the Crystalyte. Each themes is then split into different stages. 

![Universal Mirage Stages](https://preview.redd.it/bb8f209jkel71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d03e085aac6d87e8c4d901a29a90756f22a8eb2)

Fire theme has six stages, while physical, ice, and lightning themes have seven stages.

You may choose which stage you want to challenge, thereby choosing to farm only the desired type of Crystalyte.
*Example: I want to farm G2 and G3 (twilit and chasmic) purple Crystalyte, so I will choose the Roaring Palace theme, and farm either stage F4,F5, or F6.*

Each stage can be cleared in solo mode or in coop mode. The coop mode will only be unlocked after completing the solo mode once. Clearing a stage for the first time also grants you first-time clear rewards (the mirage hoard rewards are given to you for free) and unlocks the next stage.

In order to complete a Universal Mirage stage, one needs an [Invite of Mirage](https://honkaiimpact3.fandom.com/wiki/Invite_of_Mirage), or mirage tickets. At most six mirage tickets can be held at one time, and hitting the max amount means no additional tickets will be issued to you the following day. A total of ten invites of mirage is given per week: one on each day of the week, with an additional invite given to you on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Each time a stage is cleared, one invite is used up, whether clearing it solo or in coop. However, you can choose to assist a fellow player in coop mode. While you won't use up an invite of mirage, you will gain no rewards.

To do co-op for Universal Mirage, first select the "Join a Team" button:

![Joining a team](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/958102900830261308/1052660612162912356/image.png)

Hit the "Create Team" button. Make sure to allow auto-matching and turn off the Private team toggle:

![Creating a team](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/913131704753979392/1052689643029663754/image.png)

You can invite a fellow player or share the co-op team ID, or have them manually search for it when they hit the "Join a Team"  and then "Quick Join" buttons. The invited player can then toggle the Assist Mode on or off to choose whether or not they want to use an Invite of Mirage and receive rewards for completing the stage.

### Foundry Costs

These are the Stigmata forging costs, separated by type and grade.  For a more complete list, please refer to your game.

!!! info
    In the game, you can filter what grade of stigmata you want by pressing either the dropdown arrow next to the grade header or clicking the filter icon on the very top of the Foundry screen.

!!! note The difference between transmute crafting and direct crafting
    As the name implies, directly crafting a stigmata only requires Crystalyte of the corresponding grade, red lens, and ether fuel. Transmuting a stigmata requires a lesser amount of ether fuel, red lens, and G3 Crystalyte (compared to direct crafting, if that option exists), but has the downside of requiring a corresponding stigmata that is one grade lower than the one currently being crafted.

(Some G1 Stigmata cost 48 Honkai Pieces + 120 SS Imaginon or 60 Honkai Pieces + 90 SS Imaginon; the number varies.)


### Farming (Universal Mirage)

The rewards of floor clearing are as follows. The left side rewards are the guaranteed clearing rewards. The right side rewards are the mirage hoard rewards and can be redeemed by spending Time Swirl Passes upon completing a floor.

Floor | Fuel | G1 Crystalyte | G2 Crystalyte | G3 Crystalyte | G4 Crystalyte | Time Swirl Passes Needed | Fuel | G1 Crystalyte | G2 Crystalyte | G3 Crystalyte | G4 Crystalyte | Total Fuel, Salvage Everything
-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --| --
1 | 4 | 6 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 50 | 25 | 15 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 40
2 | 4 | 8 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 60 | 28 | 22 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 50
3 | 4 | 4 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 70 | 32 | 11 | 7 | 0 | 0 | 57
4 | 5 | 0 | 4 | 0 | 0 | 80 | 37 | 0 | 14 | 0 | 0 | 65
5 | 5 | 0 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 90 | 41 | 0 | 8 | 6 | 0 | 75
6 | 6 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 0 | 100 | 46 | 0 | 0 | 12 | 0 | 82
7 | 7 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 100 | 49 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 8 | 81

And here is the calculated difference between rewards obtained with time swirl passes (mirage hoard) and normal rewards. For example, for floor 1, 15 G1 Crystalyte can be obtained with time swirl passes and only 6 G1 Crystalyte without time swirl, thus a difference of 9 G1 Crystalyte is calculated. Since 4 ether fuel is normally obtained through floor 1, and 25 ether fuel is obtained through floor 1 when using time swirl passes, the difference in ether fuel becomes 21. If the difference in G1 Crystalyte is all salvaged, 9 ether fuel is obtained. Adding 9 ehter fuel to the 21 ether fuel gives us the value of 30 in the "Total Fuel, Salvage Everything" column for this table.

Floor | TSP Cost | Fuel | G1 Crystalyte | G2 Crystalyte | G3 Crystalyte | G4 Crystalyte | Total Fuel, Salvage Everything
-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --
1 | 50 | 21 | 9 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 30
2 | 60 | 24 | 14 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 38
3 | 70 | 28 | 7 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 45
4 | 80 | 32 | 0 | 10 | 0 | 0 | 52
5 | 90 | 36 | 0 | 6 | 4 | 0 | 60
6 | 100 | 40 | 0 | 0 | 9 | 0 | 67
7 | 100 | 42 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 6 | 66

Here is the normalized Time Swirl Pass (TSP) payoff, i.e. the payoff on 100 Time Swirl Pass. This is calculated as the difference in rewards gained with and without time swirl passes divided by the time swirl pass cost for that floor. So for floor 1, since the difference calculated above is 9 G1 Crystalyte and the cost is 50 TSP for getting the mirage hoard rewards, the normalized TSP payoff for G1 Crystalyte is 9/50 = 0.18.

The "Flawed Ratio" is another means of calculating efficiency in clearing mirage floors. The ratio is flawed because it divides total fuel over the amount of time swirl passes needed to claim the mirage hoard rewards for that floor, but the total fuel here includes the base fuel that one would get from clearing a floor normally. One normally gets 10 fuel from the first floor, and 40 fuel if time swirl passes are used. Divide 40 by 50 (where 50 is the number of time swirl passes needed to claim the mirage hoard rewards of floor 1) to get 0.8. Again, this is a flawed ratio since you didn't actually pay for the 10 "base" fuel.


->Floor<- | ->TSP Cost<- | ->Fuel<- | ->G1 Crystalyte<- | ->G2 Crystalyte<- | ->G3 Crystalyte<- | ->G4 Crystalyte<- | ->Normalized TSP Payoff<- | ->Flawed Ratio<-
-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --
1 | 50 | 0.42 | 0.18 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0.6 | 0.8
2 | 60 | 0.40 | 0.23 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0.63 | 0.833
3 | 70 | 0.40 | 0.10 | 0.07 | 0 | 0 | 0.64 | 0.8143
4 | 80 | 0.40 | 0 | 0.125 | 0 | 0 | 0.65 | 0.813
5 | 90 | 0.40 | 0 | 0.067 | 0.044 | 0 | 0.667 | 0.833
6 | 100 | 0.40 | 0 | 0 | 0.09 | 0 | 0.67 | 0.82
7 | 100 | 0.42 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0.06 | 0.66 | 0.81

With the normalized TSP payoff, it becomes easier to see which floors to farm if one is strictly in need for ether fuel. Floor 6 is the best to clear, followed by floor 5, then floor 7, then floor 4, 3, 2, and then floor 1. Using the flawed ratio method, floors 2 and 5 are the most preferable to clear, then floor 6, then floors 4 and 3, then floor 7, and finally floor 1.

Of course, this takes into account that you are primarily focused on farming fuel, as fuel will be a bigger bottleneck than Crystalyte or spatial lens (unless you are a beginner). If you need G1 stigmatas/weapons, then floor 2 is the best choice. If you need G2 stigmatas/weapons, then floor 4 is the best choice. Floor 6 is the best choice for G3 stigmatas. And for G4 stigmatas, you'll need to farm both floors 6 and 7. It would be best to farm floor 7 and grab the mirage hoard rewards to quickly farm G4 Crystalyte for the G4 stigmatas, then repeatedly clear floor 6 and grab the mirage hoard rewards to then farm fuel for the G4 stigmatas.

Except for G4 stigmatas, avoid transmuting when possible.

### What to farm and when

!!! note What does T,M, and B stand for?
    T refers to the stigmata that occupies the the top portion of the stigmata set. Likewise, M and B are for middle and bottom.

##### G0 (Basic Stigmata)

Roughly in farming order; may vary depending on your account.

!!! note Lier B vs Atilla B
    Lier B has a requirement for its user to be at 100 percent hp or higher. This means that it has limited usage, only fit for game modes that do not take too long to complete, such as SS bosses in Memorial Arena. Use Atilla B (or Fu Hua Pride B) when facing mobs.

!!! warning Which Stigmatas To Not Craft
    Do not craft Scott, Roald Amundsen, Theresa: Origins, Tchaikovsky, Nikola Tesla, Ogier, Edison, Attila, Ryunosuke Akutagawa, Sakamoto Ryoma, Wang Zhoujin, Galileo, or Shigure Kira, as you can obtain these for free. Neither should you farm Picasso, as you can get it through completing the corresponding Chronicles challenges. These stigmatas should only be crafted if you are desperate, fulfilling the starter event mission of crafting something from the foundry (in which case Attila B is good), or converting them into normal crystal cores (which is only done by endgame players. If that's the case, why are you here?)



- | Why You Should Farm It | When to forge | How many to forge | Cost
-- | -- | -- | -- | --
**Marco Polo TMB** | M is part of an extremely good starter physical build with Jingwei T and Lier B. TM can also work as a basic dps build for physical damage dealers, such as HoS | If you need an extra TM set and you already got the one from the training shop | 1-2 Marco Polo TM, depending on your needs | 130 SS Imaginon per piece
**Fu Hua Musician (FHM) TMB** | MB can be used as on support valks due to the 2-set piece bonus of the team dealing 10 percent bonus total damage  | If you need an extra MB set and you already got the one from the training shop | 1-2 FHM MB, depending on your needs | 120 SS Imaginon  + 50 Honkai Pieces per piece
**Theresa: Gluttony (Glut) T** | Used in combination with either FHM MB or Mei: Beach Party and Newton B on support valkryies due to its insane bonus total damage boost | ASAP | 2-3. If you need more than 3, you probably have bad gacha luck | 30 SS Imaginon
**Jingwei T** | Decent starter physical build with Marco Polo M and Lier B. Marco TM Attila B is an alternative | Around level 40, for beginners | 1 should be fine | 90 SS Imaginon
**Rasputin B** | Used in a cheap starter ice dps build with Scott TM | Only recommended if you already used your Peary set obtained from the training shop on another ice valk | 1 should be fine | 130 SS Imaginon for each piece
**Fu Hua: Pride B** | Can be used instead of Atilla B | Optional, choose when you need to | 0-1 | 30 SS Imaginon
**Yodo Dono** | A very cheap fire dps build | Not really recommended, as Leeuwenhoek + Thales is a better option | 0-1 | 60 Honkai Pieces for each piece

!!! danger DO NOT FARM DARWIN
    DO NOT FARM DARWIN. DO NOT GET IT FROM THE TRAINING SHOP. EDISON IS MUCH BETTER. DO NOT ASK WHY. IT JUST IS.

##### G1

Roughly in farming order; may vary depending on your account.

- | Why You Should Farm It | When to forge | Cost
-- | -- | -- | --
**Pledge of Sakura (PoS)** | While not a good weapon, can be used as tribute for the Salvation of Sakura PRI. Tuning PoS gives you access to a number of lightning and SP boosts in the divine keys screen | ASAP | 150 AE Imaginon + 300 fuel + Corresponding Spirit
**Lier B** | Decent starter physical build with Marco Polo M and Lier B. Marco TM Attila B is an alternative. A bit too pricy to justify crafting it | Around level 40, for beginners | 190 Phantom Grey Crystalyte + 60 Honkai Pieces + 90 SS Imaginon + 700 Fuel
**Siegfried Kaslana M** | When you need it and Origins M doesn't cut it |  Very low priority | 190 Phantom Purple Crystalyte + 80 Honkai Pieces + 90 SS Imaginon + 700 Fuel
**Briareus EX** | Only the PRI version is useful, as it is an impair source and lets your valk stay on field, useful for when you want to [proc](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/7eulti/what_does_proc_mean_in_gaming/) Snowy Sniper's passive or re-proc Newton B with Drive Kometa's Shield| Very low priority | 150 AE Imaginon + 300 Fuel + Briareus PRI Sprit to craft Briareus PRI, which is used as tribute for Briareus EX
**MAG-Typhoon** | When you know exactly what you're doing | Very low priority | 150 AE Imaginon + 300 Fuel + MagStorm Sprit to craft MagStorm, which is used as tribute for MAG-Typhoon
**Demonblade - Florid Sakura** | When you know exactly what you are doing | When you have SS FS and you can DPS with her (you can't) | --
**Cleopatra B** | Huge total damage multiplier against paralyzed enemies | When you have SSS Knight Moonbeam (very late endgame). Can also be used on Herrscher of Thunder (please don't, just farm Handel) | 190 Phantom Grey Crystalyte + 48 Honkai Pieces + 120 SS Imaginon + 700 Fuel
**Shennong T** | Used in conjunction with Shuijing MB for FT, provides huge physical damage boost | When you have SSS FT and you don't have Elysia TB, which is the superior option | 190 Phantom Grey Crystalyte + 80 Honkai Pieces + 90 SS Imaginon + 700 Fuel
**Fuxi B** | When you know exactly what you are doing | Very low priority | 190 Phantom Blue Crystalyte + 400 Ranger Creds + 125 SS Imaginon + 700 Ether Fuel
**Fuxi M** | YWhen you know exactly what you are doing; mostly Paralyze-based mobbing strats and non-SSS KM | Very low priority | 190 Phantom Blue Crystalyte + 400 Ranger Creds + 125 SS Imaginon + 700 Ether Fuel
**Fuxi T** | When you know exactly what you're doing (e.g. HT SN strat) | Very low priority| 190 Phantom Blue Crystalyte + 400 Ranger Creds + 125 SS Imaginon + 700 Ether Fuel

Pledge of Sakura is a high priority. Lier B is low priority, and the rest should not be bothered with. They are remnants of a distant past, when honkai was in its infancy.

##### G2

Roughly in farming order; may vary depending on your account.

**Jin Shengtan TM** | Extremely useful support for any elemental team | When you can't afford getting the different gear for the elemental SP support valks
**Thales M** | Works as a very good free to play fire dps set in conjunction with Leeuwenhoek TB | When you have a fire dps and not their gear
**Thales TB** | For transmuting into Leeuwenhoek TB | When you have a fire dps and not their gear. By then direct crafting into Leeuwenhoek TB should be there, hopefully (a man can dream)
**Monet T** | Can be used as a cheap lightning dps build with Ishikawa Goemon MB | When you need to
**Beethoven MB** | Cheap set for physical and dps valks. Used in some builds with HoS and SnS (Carole) | When you need to
**Tesla Band M** | Used as lightning support | When you need to
**Tesla Band T** | Used as physical support | When you need to
**Fenghuang Pinions** | Everybody should make eventually | When you get Fenghuang Down, as syncing it in the divine keys menu provides plus 10 attack to all Valkyries
**Abyss** | Everybody should make eventually | When you get Abyss Flower, as syncing it in the divine keys menu provides plus 10 attack to all Valkyries
**Robert Peary TMB** | You shouldn't, you can get it for free from the starter event's training shop | You can get it for free from the starter event's training shop

##### G3

Roughly in priority; will vary depending on your account. Many G3 stigmatas listed here are farmed to transmute into their G4 counterpart. So if you have a lightning valkryie, you'll probably be farming Ishikawa Goemon to transmute to Handel

- | Why You Should Farm It | When to forge
-- | -- | --
**Ishikawa Goemon TMB** | MB for budget lightning build with Monet T, but more useful as transmute material for Handel | When you have a lightning valk
**Dirac MB** | Very good physical dps set | When you have a physical dps valk and when Marco Polo TM Atilla/Pride/Lier B doesn't cut it
**Dirac TB** | Used to transmute to Elysia stigmata | When you have a physical dps valk and Marco Polo TM Atilla/Pride/Lier B doesn't cut it
**Leeuwenhoek TB** | Extremely good f2p fire dps set, in conjunction with Thales M | When you have a fire dps valk and not their gea
**Ana Schariac TMB** | Used with HoR and AKA, and for transmutation into Willows | When you need to for your ice dps valk
**Fu Hua: Margrave (Marg) TMB** | An ok support stigmata set used on Azure Empyrea or Phoenix. Jin Shengtan is cheaper, and Life of Bronya is a much better gacha-based option | If you need it, and JST TM or FHM MB isn't cutting it
**Irene Adler** | When you know exactly what you're doing and you have a ranked-up Fallen Rosemary | Low priority
**Kafka TM** | When you know exactly what you're doing. Can be used on PE as a cheap option | At least level 81+, maybe even later
**Allan Poe TMB** | For Stygian Nymph | Endgame, or if you're a Seele simp (in which case be wary of her onee-chan)
**Dickens** | When you know exactly what you're doing. Overshadowed by Elysia TB | Very low priority
**Shuijing** | When you know exactly what you're doing | Very low priority

##### G4

Roughly in priority; will vary depending on your account

-- | -- | --
**Handel TMB** | Extremely good set for lightning valks | As soon as you get a lightning dps valk
**Willows TMB** | Extremely good set for HoR and AKA | When you get HoR or AKA
**Elysia TB** | Very good physical dps set for valkryies that have physical charged attack (like FT) | Level 81+
**Elysia M** | For SS+ Elysia | Level 81+

###General Farming Order

Here is a general farming order. Note that a beginner will easily have enough fuel for G4 Stigmatas, but will be constrained by red convectrons:

1. Attila B (to fulfill the Starter Event mission)

### Time horizon - "How long does it take?"

Until I get someone to crunch some actual numbers, here's a [SWAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_wild-ass_guess) on how long it takes to farm a single stigmata piece

##### G4 Stigmata

Around 5 weeks each

##### G3 Stigmata

Around 3 weeks each


##### G2 Stigmata

Around 2 weeks each


##### G1 Stigmata

Around a week and a half


##### Reroll Devices

You can get around 4 and 1/4 Reroll Devices per patch if purely farming Reroll Devices.
