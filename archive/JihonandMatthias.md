#That Damned Smile...

If one were to listen closely in one of the many darkened halls of Hogwarts that night, they might have been caught, thankfully no one was around to hear the shameless gasps and growls of hormonal students who had been dancing a playful game for as long as they could really recall. Fingers toyed and tugged against a nearly barren pubic area, brushing over one Slytherin students clit, Jihon Yeou, one of the Quiddich team and known for her radiant smile and...slightly mischievous ways. Her desire for chaos and penchant for tomfoolery set her upon another, a more reserved and quiet wizard of Ravenclaw, Matthias Herdorum.

He had been so curious as to why the girl had set her sights on him, following him around, that damned smile. He was distraught for answers until one night when he left the Ravenclaw common rooms for the bathroom, he was set upon yet again but this time...things were different. There was s different look in her eye, a certain tease in her smile that was unmistakable and the stars finally aligned in his mind at those words she had said to him one day. 


I enjoy praising you further in whatever manner you'd most prefer.




How had he not seen it before....


His fingers firmly rubbed her clit, her hands tangling in his hair, his favorite hat knocked to the floor of the dark, empty bathroom as she whimpered. Her tongue hung from her mouth a little as she had stripped down to nothing but her favorite scarf. She had said she didn't want to catch a cold....how funny. Matthias' mask pushed up just above his mouth, still keeping his entire face covered as teeth found it's way to her shoulder, making her whine a bit more. He pulled away, teasingly prodding her aching slit with one of his fingers as he spoke. 

”If this was what you wanted, you could have told me...” He breathed into her ear, nipping it with his lips before sliding a finger deep into her dripping pussy, making her knees pull together slightly. “ Tch....needy little thing aren't you? Where did all of that smugness go, hm? Don't tell me all I needed to do was give you a little attention...” He hissed. Jihon was already nearing some sort of limit, she wasn't sure what but she was grabbing her own breasts, pinching her own nipples as he played with her like a toy. She had been following him for what felt like ages, trying to find out how to coerce him into some...recreational activity. She always wondered how that Hufflepuff slut made it look so easy but that didn't matter now. 

She  moaned, one hand reaching up to tangle in his dark hair yet again as she tried to turn to catch a glimpse of him but of course he only started to finger her aching pussy faster. “Hgnn!!~ Right there....There....!” she begged, the dark haired wizard leaning in close to kiss down her neck and spoke again. 

”This doesn't leave this room....understood?” He said, the one hand that was holding her at the hips started to work on undoing his trousers. 

Jihon licked her lips a bit, giggling as that damn smile started to spread along her face. 

”Just as long as you don't leave any hole untouched, mask.”


Matthias knew what sort of plan he had for her, she was such a teasing little minx, a brat in her purest form. He knew the remedy for her though, he felt his pants fall do his ankles and in a deft movement, stepped out of his freshly shined shoes and kicked the entire lot behind him as his hands roamed, mouth marking her shoulder and neck as his own. He kissed and nipped, growling low and deep as his lust was overflowing now. They wouldn't have a lot of time and they were playing with fire as is, it wouldn't take much for someone to come in, for another ghost to wonder through the walls of the lavatory to catch the deplorable act. 

”Hmph...” He breathed out, lips leaving her skin for the moment. “honestly, when I saw you that day, frowning, I should have known something was wrong.”

Jihon whined, arching and pressing her bare ass against him, he was only in a pair of dark burgundy boxers that were barely constraining his 'wand'. She could feel it press against her, sliding upwards between her ass cheeks as she started to haplessly grind against him. 

”I...Ahh...I just...wanted you to notice....what I was wearing...” She breathed out, Matthias rolling his eyes just a little. Of course that was what it was, and shame to him for being so wrapped up in his dark arts studies to notice. He vowed he'd never cause that smile to fade, never again. 

He reached up with one hand to wrap gently around her neck, the other holding her at the hip as he shuffled out of his underwear as well. 


“Come here...” He whispered to her, angling her face to his so he could kiss her, tongues writhing together in a wet, carnal dance of lust as his cock throbbed against her heated skin. He grabbed the base of it and started to teasingly slide the head between her legs, over her tight entrance a few times until it was glossy with her essence. Finally though, he pushed forward, his thick head being surrounded by heat and a firm grip that made him shudder. Jihon felt it too, her knees buckling a little, so much so that she had to grab his arm to keep herself from falling. 

”F-Fuck!” she cried out, the masked boy chuckling a little as he started to slowly push deeper until his pelvis was against her ass. 

”How about we play a little game...Here...” He moved her hands, placing them on her knees so she was forced to bend and squat a bit, she looked over her shoulder at him, that smug smile turned into a begging, doe eyed look of lust. “W-What...what do you mean?” She asked, Matthias simply gripped her hips and pulled back before slamming forward! Jihon yelped, glasses teetering and nearly falling off her nose as he started to pound into her slopping wet cunt. 

”Ngh...Keep standing...or...I'll leave.” He explained, the dots connecting quick for someone as sharp as Jihon but it only elicited a whine from her, she would much rather be on top of him but she didn't have much say. She felt her body jolt forward with each thrust, the sound of sensual skin on skin echoing off bathroom walls and stalls. 

”That's it....just like that you little smug slut...take it.” He ordered, his voice the only thing Jihon could hear in her own head besides her animistic moans. She did her best to hold her ground, twitching and nearly falling one time but she held herself, biting the corner of her lip each time his fat cock brushed over a sensitive spot. It was like that for some time, Jihon could barely speak a coherent sentence as he slowed his pace, reaching down to tug her head back by her hair as he slowly pulled out of her. She had cum at least twice now, she stumbled a bit but before she could fall, Matthias moved quick and she was in his arms, held up by her legs. 

Though now there something different....

His mask had clattered to the floor, exposing his face to the girl who stared, wide eyed for a moment before simply leaning in and kissing him deeply. It set a fire to him, he carried her to a stall door and pushed her against it, holding her up as she crossed her legs around his hips and the fucking began again. The creek of the doors, the moans, the sloppy kisses. It was all so much...

Jihon could feel him getting a little bigger, leaning back to bite his lip a bit and stare him down, giggling a little. “I know you want to, what are you holding back for, Masky~” she teased, Matthias grit his teeth and glared, almost lovingly, into her eyes. 

”Cheeky fucking brat.” He said before picking up his thrusts almost two fold. Jihon was shocked, he head tilting back as every inch was removed and steadily jammed back into her over and over as she begged him to finish. 

”P-Please, I-Inside...I need you to fucking cum inside me!”


Almost as if it was a spell in itself, just that much was enough for him, his motions got a bit more haphazard and jittery before finally just slamming down one last time, hilting his cock in her pussy and feeling his balls contract a bit. 

”Gods!!” He cried out, dumping out spurt after spurt of hot, sticky, virile cum deep into her, he swore he had shot it directly into her womb. He gasped a bit, unable to really hold onto her for more than a few more moments before he gently released her legs but Jihon was alert, keeping her legs crossed around him and using the stall door as leverage she stayed, looking at him and gently reaching out to touch his bare cheek. 

”I wondered why you wore that silly thing...” She said softly, batting her lashes a little. 

Matthias could feel the heat on his face, looking away for a bit. 

”You really ARE irritating, you know that?” He said, Jihon just had that smile on her face, that damned smile....
