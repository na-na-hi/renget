A Cat and a Fox's Story
By Meowstic-anon

"Aight, alight—let's go this way!" I pointed at the left corridor. 

"H-huh...?" An Espurr partner of mine, Stargazer, tilts his head and looks at me. "Don't you usually go... the other way?"

"Nah, I believe this one's the jackpot!" I know what he's trying to say, but this odd feeling I had tells me to go this way. It's overwhelming... but my instinct says otherwise. "Ya better not get lost, just this once... Hold onto my tail. Don't ya try anything funny, though!"

He sighs, "Yeah, yeah," I could squeeze through this quite narrow path, and my partner follows suit. "Are you sure this is the way, though?" He asks. 

"Imma sure!" I proudly proclaimed, "They say treasures are hidden in tricky places, right? Kyukyukyu!"

"I suppose that's true..." When we made it past this hallway, we ended up in an open area with shiny crystals illuminating the entire place. It's so pretty to look at that I quickly walk towards the wall of those crystals. "...Ah!" A 'click' sound was heard. I turn back, and it seems Star tripped over one of the traps!

"Lily, you dolt!" I shout as the whole place crumbles apart, and the next thing I know, we are falling. "Ugh shoot. I think we don't have an escape orb! Lily!"

"Y-Yes!!" He shouted, "I think we can use this!" He brought out a Pounce Orb—that could actually work... 

In a tick of a second, he suddenly charges towards me by using the orb on me, like he was grabbed by a strong rope. He tackles me, which gives me momentum so I can get closer to the wall. I prepare my claws and slide to negate the fall while Star is trying his best to 'swim' towards me before we get splattered from the bottom.

At the nick of time, he managed to latch on to me, and I was able to slow down the fall. That we made it only with some scratches. The place we are at is very dark, with the light shining far above us. I think it's that room where we fell from, and it's around 20 to 30 stories away. This Mystery Dungeon is quite deceptive, even for me.

Star takes out a lamp from my bag that Lady Marigold gave us earlier today. He lights it up with a match. It's similar to the previous place, minus the crystals on the walls, and there's a structure at the end of the room. Looking around, there doesn't seem to be any way to leave this place—in other words, we are stuck here...

The structure on the wall is a massive mirror. It seems like some sort of sacred alter, given the pedestals all around it. Star curiously inspects the mirror closer, but no matter which angle we look at it from, it's just any ordinary mirror. We even made funny faces and joked around until I accidentally kicked a pebble into the mirror.

"Ahh!" We both screamed. We expected to see it shatter, but instead, it went... inside the mirror? This, of course, peaks our interest. I put my paw on the mirror, and just like the pebble, it passed through it. It's quite creepy—something out of this world! 

I turn to Star and say, "Kyukyukyu, Lady Marigold is gonna be surprised by what we found! We gotta bring 'em home!"

Of course, Star is thinking as usual. It took him a while to speak: "...This is too big for us to bring, but maybe a shard would do, but it might lose its magic...? And we are stuck here... We could climb back up, but it's quite long and it's quite steep, though we can send SOS with our badges, hmm..." He then continues to ponder.

But I have an idea! "We can enter the mirror and find a way out from there!"

"...That would be possible," he commented, "but you should stay here while I explore inside this mirror, just to be safe." He then takes out a roll of string we got from Spidops a couple days ago.

"B-but why!?" I ask. 

"If anything happens, I'll yank the string rapidly; that means you have to pull me back here, but if it's only once, that means I made it out, and you just had to follow." He talks as he prepares the string, like it's a thin rope.

"Okay Lily..." I grip tightly on the string thing and watch him enter the portal with the other end of the string. He said he'd be back in a few minutes and disappeared as he completely engulfed himself inside the mirror.

->...<-

It has been a very long time. I believe it has been 15 minutes by now... "Stargazer... you liar..." I unconsciously mumbled.

Lately, I have been... hearing voices in my head. Telling me bad things—very bad things—about my friend. I don't know why, but I'm enticed to believe them when I shouldn't have... 'Cut it', 'abandon them inside', please make it stop! I don't want to think about doing such a thing, and besides, help is on the way... Though I'm also worried about him, I decided to peep my head into the mirror and see what's on the other side.

The landscape inside the mirror is a forest, but it's blue while the sky is green. It's a sight of serene surrealism... I can see the string made it past the clearing, but I can't see what's beyond. Did he find a village? Or was he in trouble since I haven't felt the string being pulled at all for a while now... Is he unconscious? I wish I could enter and check it out, but I do agree that we might get stuck in there if we both enter... 

While I'm not like Stargazer, I tried to do my best to think and think harder of the best solution... and I can't think of any. This is so frustrating! All I can do is just wait for either help to arrive or his re— 'thud' I suddenly heard something coming from behind. I slowly turned my head to the back, and a giant Druddigon seemed to land from above. "Not good," is all I could say in my head.

I quickly dodged that Pokémon's attacks, and I was about to attack until the voice in my head yelled at me to not attack and do not let go of the string! That was odd, but I followed that instruction and kept on dodging, and before I knew it, he was drawing so close to the mirror that I had to go behind them. This isn't good at all! He could snap the string if he—as I think of that, and he seems to notice the string—I had to attack him; there's no other way!

I used Shadow Claw as usual, but instead, I did it with my left hand, which isn't the best in terms of accuracy, but it did its job, and this Pokémon sustained the damage. Then I followed it with a Shadow Sneak, and it lost its footing on the pedestal. I celebrated this victory, but it was too early for that, as then, Druddigon tumbled over into the mirror, shattering it. I immediately yelled at the top of my lungs, "Stargazer!!!" but only my voice, that Pokémon's grunts, and those mirror shards falling to the floor echoed the entire room... 

I quickly reeled in the string, but then I got to the end of it—it was snapped. "No!" I yelled out. I came running to the shards. I tried to go through the shards, but I couldn't; all I got were scratches. I tried over and over again while disregarding that Druddigon behind me.

"No way..." over and over again. I tried it again until my paws started bleeding from the cuts. "No... no!!" I remained in denial until the pain set in and Druddigon got back up, smacked me by the head, and hurled me into the other side of the room.

This is all unreal realism; it's not a dream, though I wanted it to be all just a bad dream, but I—I don't know what to do anymore, I'm... frantic on what's on my mind, and Druddigon comes close and seemingly wants to end me. Then I just embraced it and didn't fight back. It's not like... living is worth it until they suddenly collapse beside me. From above, it's Lady Marigold doing a nose-dive, and she casts some sort of bubble all around herself, which pops as she lands. She's all fine despite coming from far above, however.

"Ma-master!!" I cried out.

She runs towards me and holds me up. "Stupid, stupid Larks!" She then flicks my forehead, and while it was painful, I'm glad to see her—really glad! I think she can fix this... She has to!

I pointed at the mirror shards, but she ignored all that and focused more on her injuries. "No!" I shouted, "Stargazer's in trouble at the mirror beyond!" 

"Your injuries are serious, though," she argues. "Also, who's... Stargazer?" she tilts her head as she looks at me.

My eyes widened. "...Huh?"

->**To "bereave" someone who is no longer in this world**<-

The last thing I remembered was tears—crying to the shards as the bleeding from the cuts worsened. I begin to see Stargazer inside those shards, delusion or not, his blurry figure recedes further and further into this supposing mirror world. "Mirror on the wall, why doesn't he come back to this world!? Mirror on the wall! Mirror on that wall!!!!" I lash out until my voice cracks.

Lady Marigold understandably startled, decided to silently use an Escape Orb and carry me by her shoulders. "The bleeding must have gone through your head," she comments.

I reach out my hands as the light engulfs me and shout, "Don't leave me!!"

And the next thing I knew, I was back in my bed, and nobody was there right beside me to greet me, 'Good morning'... There's not even a bed at all... It's like he never existed to begin with...
