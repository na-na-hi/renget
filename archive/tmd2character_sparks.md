### Sparks ♂
Sparks was found by the guild when he showed up one day. Unable to remember a single thing about the life before him, he's decided to dedicate this new life to adventuring. While having the tendency to easily become lost without directions, he's elected to learn how to use the Wonder Maps to guide his way when delving deep into the dungeons. He's made great friends with the other members of Team Shock... and they're always first into battle!
