#The Tale of Chudstal Miokiller

Chudstal was just like any other person.
He hated Mio.
Unlike other people, he had 34 years of experience of shooting people with crystals.
He had already hunted down most of Mio's bloodline, but now he had finally tracked her down to Shiketsu.

-------------------------------------------------------

Today was like any other for Mio. She had finished killing her ninth orphan and was working on poisoning the entire city.
Several police men had stopped Mio on the way to the water plant, but after realizing it was Mio, they said the same thing they always did.
"You're such a card, Mio! Good luck with poisoning everyone and killing those orphans!"
As Mio was allowed to just walk into the water plant, she was surprised when she was alone with some weird balding guy.
"Mio, you piece of trash! I'm gonna kill you!"
Mio reached for her gun she nicknamed the "Orphan Killer" but Chudstal was too fast. He riddled Mio's stupid face with holes.
As he stopped blasting crystals out of his weird crystal fingers, he contemplated on life.
*I did it! I did my life's work! The world will change for the better with Mio dead!*

-------------------------------------------------------

Chudstal exited the water plant, and was met with thunderous applause.
People from around the world were happy to here that someone had finally killed Mio.
One of the people who met with Chudstal was the pope.
Pope Quirkius the VIII had something to talk about with Chudstal.
"Say, Chudstal, how'd you get around killing Mio without summoning the Antichrist?"
"...What."
"Y'know, Mio is Satan's vessel on Earth. If you kill her, he shows up."
"W. h. a. t."
"Yeah, that's why no one else killed her until now. We haven't found a way to stop Satan from being summoned. How'd you do it?"
For some reason, the sky turned a hideous red. A roar was heard from the water plant, and a hideous crimson serpant with horns emerged from the ground beneath it. Those who were not overcome with pain and died immediately due to the visage of the evilest being in the world were overcome moments later when blood started falling from the sky. The blood burned through flesh and bone, inflicting unimaginable pain upon those who came in contact with it. As the people around Chudstal all horribly died, he was safe due to his Crystal body.
Chudstal looked upon the Beast with scorn.
"Satan! I'll send you back to hell where you belong!"
As the Pinnacle of Evil raised it's tail to crush Chudstal, it snarled and shrieked. Oceans around the world started to boil. It's horrible tail crushed Chudstal, and a chasm opened up in the earth where it struck. Brimstone and flames licked at the area around the attack, and the blood from the sky started to fall even faster. Around the world, blood began to flood. Satan grew even taller and more monstrous as the blood flowed. Soon, cities around the world were submerged in the acidic blood, billions dead. As Satan was at a gargantuan size, visible from space, he felt a tickle in his ear.
"I'm in your EAR, you cuck!"
Chudstal started stabbing his way through Satan's head with his sharp chud-hands. For whatever reason, his crystals were the ultimate tool for defeating Satan.

-------------------------------------------------------

After hours of hacking through flesh, he met bone. After days of picking through the bone, he met brain matter. And, finally, after a few more hours of tearing through the tissue, he met the core of Satan. He knew what must be done.
He took his crystal penis out and pissed his crystal piss all over Satan. Satan made the most unimaginable noises that would cause any normal human to feel like they suffered 10,000 years of torture. Chudstal was not a normal person. As the crystal piss finally destroyed the rest of the core, Satan began to decay.
Chudstal fell from the decaying body and plummeted from orbit all the way to Earth.

-------------------------------------------------------

As Chudstal woke up, he looked at the ruined landscape. He woke up in a puddle of blood, no longer acidic, but merely a drop of the blood that had drowned the world. He was the last human. He had killed Mio, but at what cost?

Chudstal considered this, and looked at his crystal penis, the weapon that had finally defeated Satan.

He smiled.

In the end, it was worth it.
