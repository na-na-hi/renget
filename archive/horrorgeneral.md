## WebMs (recording and encoding)

You want to make some .WebM clips of your gameplay footage to share in the threads?

!!! note Gameplay recording:
If you are a Nvidia user, you can just use the GeForce/ShadowPlay utility built into your video drivers and customize your hotkeys (default should be Alt+Z to enable the recording overlay).
You can also use a third-party screen recording software like [OBS](https://obsproject.com/).

!!! note WebM for Lazies:

How to use [WebM for Lazies](https://argorar.github.io/WebMConverter/) to convert your videos:
>Download and install the [latest build of AviSynth.](http://avisynth.nl/index.php/Main_Page#Official_builds) ==required==

>Download and unpack the [latest build of WebM for Lazies](https://github.com/argorar/WebMConverter/releases/latest) in folder of your choice (latest version of "WebM for..." tool with VP9 support).

* 1. Launch WebMConverter.exe and open your recorded video in it. `(you may encounter an error message if the built-in updater is blocked by your firewall)`
* 2. Be mindful of the 4MB upload limit.
* 3. In the *Processing* tab, you can easily trim, crop, resize, etc. your footage. It's best to keep footage under 30-60 seconds. You can apply some light cropping and resize to lower resolution to reduce output filesize.
* 4. In the *Encoding* tab, set *Mode* to variable, enable *High quality mode*. Default *CRF* value should be set at around 30. You can try raising the value between 30 and 40 or above to reduce filesize output until you get a result under 4MB (upload limit), but this will also reduce video quality. It's best to reduce resolution rather than cranking up CRF too much. Alternatively, you can set *Mode* to Constant and force *Size limit* to 3.9MB but quality won't be optimal.
* 5. In the *Advanced* tab, tick the VP9/Opus box. You only need to tick it once as it should remember your choice. VP9 offers better quality output for lesser filesizes, but takes longer to encode.
* 6. To make more complex edits, click on the down-arrow next to *Trim* and select *Multiple trim*. Use *Go to* to directly input footage timecode or frame  number.

!!! note /wsg/, Streamable and Audio script:
Alternatively, if your WebM is too long, too large in size, or contains audio, you can quickly upload it to [/wsg/](https://boards.4channel.org/wsg/) or [Streamable](https://streamable.com/).
* [/wsg/ board](https://boards.4channel.org/wsg/): Post webm in [/wsg/](https://boards.4channel.org/wsg/), then link it in the thread. 6MB limit, supports audio.
 * [Streamable:](https://streamable.com/) Requires quick account signup. 250MB limit, supports audio.

 You can also share WebMs with external audio on non-audio boards via [this custom userscript](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/402682-4chan-sounds-player) ([Tampermonkey, a script manager for your browser, is required](https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=tampermonkey)). Once installed, go in "Tools", "Data" section and input both your WebM video and audio source, then "Create", then "Post". This will upload the audio file to a third-party site and embed in your filename. Plays well with [4chanx.](https://www.4chan-x.net/)

## Guides for PC best versions

### Resident Evil

!!! note Download PC ports

>[Resident Evil 1](https://archive.org/details/biohazard-mediakite) + [Patch](https://classicrebirth.com/index.php/downloads/resident-evil-classic-rebirth/)
>[Resident Evil 2](https://archive.org/details/biohazard-2-sourcenext) + [Patch](https://classicrebirth.com/index.php/downloads/resident-evil-2-classic-rebirth/) 
>[Resident Evil 3](https://archive.org/details/biohazard-3-source-next) + [Patch](https://classicrebirth.com/index.php/downloads/resident-evil-3-classic-rebirth/)

Alternatively, emulating the PS1 versions (via DuckStation) or GameCube ports (via Dolphin) is easy.

!!! info RE1 has multiple versions, including a "Director's Cut", which adds a new difficulty with different enemy placement and camera angles. Avoid the infamous "Dual Shock" version of the RE1: Director's Cut, which changes the musical score.

!!! note Texture mods
>[HD Project for RE2](https://www.reshdp.com/re2/) & [RE3](https://www.reshdp.com/re3/) (AI upscaling)
>[HD Project for RE4](https://twitter.com/re4hdproject) (currently down?)

!!! note Tweaks
>[RE4 Tweaks](https://github.com/nipkownix/re4_tweaks)
>[RE5 Tweaks](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=588916102)
>[RE8 Tweaks](https://github.com/praydog/REFramework)

### Silent Hill

!!! note Download PC ports

>[Silent Hill 1](https://mega.nz/#!bVUCTJzD!PmnPw4S7fWGyvTjw9S0-RQdk7rRp2BQNuXJqRkZCZvk) `PS1 ROM` + [emulate via DuckStation](https://emulation.gametechwiki.com/index.php/DuckStation)
>[Silent Hill 2](https://mega.nz/#!rFcj1SIJ!47JH9M4OrzmQKuaiJ6IqUgmgz_SVNtk4LIYNSa-D-_8) `PC NTSC` + [Enhanced Edition mod](http://www.enhanced.townofsilenthill.com/SH2/) (just run the installer ; "Enhanced .EXE" is also the no-CD crack)
>[Silent Hill 3](https://mega.nz/#!2JNkgJ7b!nfPf5cIs6I5K-sdAs7RcnHvGA2hAvIGdpQuIoBhF3iE) `PC NTSC` + [PC Tweaks like Widescreen Fix](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Silent_Hill_3)
>[Silent Hill 4](https://mega.nz/#!Us1XTaII!cglH0dZOaH5yQEm4cnEh3eyUz4bIf6rACQqcVzkb4Hc) `PC NTSC` + [PC Tweaks](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Silent_Hill_4:_The_Room)

!!! info Mount PC versions ISOs via W10's own virtual disc mounter or using Daemon Tools. Don't install under "C:\Program Files\" as this could cause issues.

Alternatively, you may also try emulating the PS2 versions. However, [avoid the "HD Collection"](https://i.imgur.com/cn9chMe.jpeg).
