I awoke early in the morning, the sun just beginning to rise over the horizon. The cool morning breeze blows across my face as I open my eyes, the trees of the forest stretching tall overhead and...Wait, forest?! Sitting up, I look at my surroundings once more, trying not to panic. I see...just a bunch of trees. I've lived my whole life around trees, but forests tend to look pretty similar everywhere. Could I merely be a few miles from home? Maybe I have amnesia? ...No, I definitely remember my past, and I know for a fact I went to sleep in my own bed last night.

As I look around confused, I glance down and see a small brown body, along with dark brown arms.
 “Huh?” 
Standing up, I look myself over, spotting green bits on my side and behind me, a tail?! I feel my blood run cold as I realized what's happened, I've become a Chespin! I can't help but let out a loud, terrified scream, not only am I lost but I'm not even human anymore! I feel my heart pounding as I try to brainstorm about what I should do.

My first thought is that I, through some sick twist of fate, somehow ended up in the Pokemon world. The real question there is, is it the “normal” one, or the one with only Pokemon and no humans? Of course, I can still be in the normal world, but that'll be far worse for me right now! If that was the case, it'd only be a matter of time before I got captured by some scientist or something equally horrifying!

No matter how bad my situation actually is, one thing is for sure, I need a drink. Maybe it'll help clear my mind? Standing up, I take my first, wobbly steps as a Chespin towards a nearby pond. At least I still have arms and legs, there's no telling how bad it could have gotten if I got turned into something without either one of those!


Crouching down near the water, I stare at the faint reflection. Yep, I'm definitely a Chespin. Sighing in frustration, I scoop up some water, sipping it up. At least the pond looks clean, most of the ones back home looked too dirty to drink out of. As I drink, I see a figure rising towards the surface. Scared, I quickly back away, not wanting something trying to take a bite out of me!

As I turn to leave, I hear a gentle splashing sound as the figure breaks the surface.
“Hey! What's got you so spooked?”
The voice sounded small and non-threatening. Turning back around, I spot a big blue head, with pinkish gills on both sides. I let out a sigh of relief as I realize that it's a Wooper...wait, a Wooper?! That means this isn't the “normal” world after all! Feeling thankful that the first other Pokemon I've found wasn't an immediate threat, I answer.

“I...probably shouldn't say. You wouldn't believe my if I told you”
“Aw, c'mon! Just tell me, I ain't gonna laugh!”

I pause for a moment. It's not like telling the truth could make things worse at this point.

“I woke up like this not too long ago. But last night, I was human! I don't know where I am or what's going on!”
“Human? You mean like those stories?”

I pause for a moment as I realize that his response means this is definitely the world with only Pokemon! At least that means there's no risk of getting kidnapped by some scientist or ten year old with a magic ball.

“Maybe? But I definitely didn't look like this until now!”
“Well...okay, I believe you!”
“Wait, really? That easily?”
“Yeah! Why not? Besides, in all those stories, the human's always got another Pokemon along with him to save the day!”
“Are you trying to say you want to come along with me? Do I look like I know where anything is?”
“You look completely clueless! You'll want me along, I know it! Besides, I'm stronger than I look!”

The Wooper walks out of the pond, and I am instantly taken aback by how tall he is. Or rather, how short I am, since we're both the same height! I stare into his tiny eyes, debating if I should agree to it.
Ah, what the heck, anything's better than being totally alone in a strange world.

“Alright, you can tag along. What should I call you?”
“Wooper! How about your name?”
“A-well uh...Chespin will do.” Walking around with a normal, human name would only make me stick out even harder, after all.
“Okay! C'mon, follow me!”


I follow Wooper through the forest as I try to come to grips with my new reality. My steps feel slow and sluggish, and I feel as though I've been awake for days instead of mere minutes. Wooper looks back at me, a small frown on his face.

“What's wrong?”
“I feel really tired...”
“Now that you mention it, you DO look a little discolored! Hmm...Oh! Maybe you just need to get some sunlight! The canopy's pretty thick here, after all. Follow me, there's a clearing pretty close by!”


I take a deep breath, putting what little energy I have into making it to the clearing. Wooper has a point, if I'm a Chespin now, surely sun will help me. It isn't long before I spot it, rays of light shining down from the sky. I pick up the pace, my steps feeling almost desperate. 
As the first bit of sunlight hits me, I fall to the ground, overwhelmed by the sensation. The sun felt nice as a human, but this was unlike anything I had ever felt before in my life! A pleasant tingling sensation enveloped my body as I felt my fatigue melt away. In just a few moments, I've gone from feeling sleepy and sluggish to totally revitalized! Jumping back up, I turn to Wooper.

“Oh yeah! That stuff really works!”
“Woohoo!”
“Alright! Now I feel ready to take on whatever comes around!” 

Stretching the last bit of weariness out of my body, I tense up my shoulders, suddenly feeling a bizarre ticklish sensation! Confused, I reach back to feel around, finding something coming out of me!

“Ah! What is that?!”
“It's your vines, dummy!”

Calming down a little, I turn to look at them. They were dark green, slender, and strangely enough I could feel every inch of them as though they were another pair of arms. “I-I knew that!” I say unconvincingly. Beginning to test out my newfound abilities, I find that flexing my shoulders makes the vines extend out even further, and relaxing made them retract. 
Extending them once more, the vines seem to obey my thoughts, snaking towards wherever I told them to go. Curious, I guide them towards a small nearby rock, lifting and throwing it with ease. This feels...almost natural, somehow. Was it pure instinct helping me out? Whatever it was, it certainly made me feel better about myself! At least now, if we ran into any kind of threat, I'd be able to put up a fight.

“Looks like you got the hang of it! Nice job, Chespin! So, you ready to see the town?”
“This soon?! Won't I stick out pretty hard? I mean, with how I walk, how I react to stuff, how I-”
“You worry too much, you'll be totally fine! C'mon, I know a place where we can get a bite to eat!”
