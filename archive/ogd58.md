Name: Wen Lifen(Last to First order)
Gender: Female
Age: 95

One of the innumerable children of Wen clan, who's pleasure houses can be found in most cities.  Lifen had the fortune to be raised amongst the inner membership of the family, as the fruit of a cultivator's fling with a maid.  She was kept and found to be a talented courtesan, able to compete in extremely deadly and complicated theatrical fights despite her lack of formal training.  She quickly went from a curiosity amongst the central Wen family to a source of immeasurable wealth with her talent for making narcotics and fighting skills with sabers.  
She is wandering performer of her deadly art, her soul already signed away to the Demon that the central Wen family worships, and a constant hunger for power and riches that strattles the line between abject greed and immeasurable pride.

However, she is not monster herself, yet.  She still regularly visits her mothers grave, and has made signifigent personal sacrafices to ensure her own children from her affairs find trustworthy masters among the Wen family.  She is a person who frequently seeks the pleasures of the flesh, with only her truest lovers knowing her more submissive and sweet side which she has been trained to never reveal to anyone but the central family, and the few people who impress her enough to be relied on.

Royal Bloodline: House of the Reveler
On the surface the large and open house of Revelers seems a place of joy and prospererity for any who make the journey to their pleasure houses, but a wiser man will see the chains of hedonism applied as soon as possible: addiction, attachment, and eventual compulsion to sign deals with the sects demonic god/goddess.  These deals make life a constant rush, a high stakes game which will make you stronger the more pleasure you experiance, the more strength you gather, the more the demon is sated to give you their own abundant power.  Should a cultivator who took this deal decide to settle down for a boring life, or seek some kind of enlightenment, they will have their life essence drained by the sects demon, killing them within one week even with expert medical care.

For the higher-up members of the sect with better contracts, they can "gamify" anything, upping the interest, risk, and pleasure gained from the activity.
A board game will become a figurative fight for life and death for the tow players, a barfight a festivity of performative martial arts, even a task as mundane as travelling can be turned into a race amongst those present.  This effect is accomplished by the release of Qi, like a breath of intoxicating perfume.  Works in a small radius, but is known to be contagious as the cultivator who started the event gets more Qi back, and can release more to risk gaining more.

>Techniques:
Aggrandizing Gallery(Qi Gathering, R7)
"Saves" an experiance in Lifen's inner palace so, not so it can be experianced again, but as a trophy marking another pleasure of the world down as seen.  These can vary from pleasant interactions with farmers to emotional highs from drugs and duels.

Wall of Luminous Petals(Stealth, R6)
Lifen can surround herself in a thin, secondary skin which acts as a disguise.  It falls apart when she is struck with an attack, with all but the weakest techniques penetrating it.  This diguise must measure up to her standards of beauty(masculine or feminine), as it would shame her demon god to appear ugly for any reason.

Mistress of the Artificial Ascension(Proffession, R10(55))
Lifen's talent since her youth has been the slow and careful creation of drugs designed to elavate ones state of conciousness and ease feelings of joy out of others.  These are often highly addictive to non-cultivators and new disciples, with herself not physicially but emotionally dependent on them.  These usually take the form of powders encased in thin pills.

Rising Action(Attack, R6)
Lifen's "bread and butter" attack, supernaturally swift but with a critical flaw: Any time it is used, regardless of user intention it will be directed toward a
"Wounding" location(Shoulder, thigh, arm, etc) even if it was aimed toward a vital spot.  Designed more for raising the stakes of a battle than actually ending one.

Climax(Trump Card, R10(65))
Lifen's blade is elongated with purple flames, bottoming out her Qi reserves in a final attack specialized in leaving at the very least a grevious wound wherever it strikes.  Can cut through whole buildings, and if the death, destruction, or injury it brings is satisfying enough to Lifen, much of the Qi dumped into can be returned.  However, if it is dodged she is defenseless in her despair.

>Treasures
"Soulpiercer"(R10 Weapon, +25 in this section, 5 After Upgrade)
	Perfect Quality
	Like Divine Steel(30)
	Treasure Spirit(37)
	Immortal Treasure(Causes Pleasurable Hallucinations to all enemies and bystanders near the blade when it is unsheathed, 22)
	Cursed Treasure(32)
	Life-Bound Treasure(17)
A saber sent forth by the Wen Sect's demon God, a blade that Lifen won in mortal theatrical combat.  It is bound to her lifeforce like a benign parasite, requiring speaking to her as taunting demon would, daring her gamble her life harder with every day.  Curses Lifen with extremely vivid dreams/nightmares depending on how pleased the demon is.
	
>Fatal Flaws: Crippled Talent(Soul, 27), Ruthless Foes(32)
Lifen's soul is already in the grasp of a monster far beyond the comprehension of man, not that she minds too much.  The high-and-mighty way of speaking to even her elders give her a 
constant stream of jealous lovers, struggling herablists, and zealous disciples to brutalize in theatrical combat.
