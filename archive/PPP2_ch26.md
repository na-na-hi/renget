#### Testing
>*“I have only proven the code correct, not tested it.”* —Donald Knuth

*"This chapter covers testing and design for correctness. These are huge topics, so we can only scratch their surfaces. The emphasis is on giving some practical ideas and techniques for testing units, such as functions and classes, of a program. We discuss the use of interfaces and the selection of tests to run against them. We emphasize the importance of designing systems to simplify testing and the use of testing from the earliest stages of development. Proving programs correct and dealing with performance problems are also briefly considered."*
