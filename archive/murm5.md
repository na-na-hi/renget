>no

>you got up and just decided to try and walk it off
>whatever he saw was changing and that was super strange
>maybe the dreams were not natural
>they couldn't be
>you couldn't place it
>maybe play more of the game?
>the thought had occurred 
>it was tied to the game

>that same code jumble from your nightmare
>yellow now
>it hung on the screen indefinitely until you turned the TV off 
>again you unplugged the system 
>put it in your closet and put on another crossdressing anime thing to get your mind off things
>it troubled you
>what was going on
>on your phone you looked around the internet for more information 
>you tried a thread on /x/ only to get drowned out by succubus threads and schizo posting
>so after about a half hour of searching you seemed to pull nothing
>this game was the only copy that got onto disc as far as you knew
>dev company went under after
>programmers flew off in a dozen different directions 
>you figured you'd go onto social media and maybe coax one out
>you weren't one for Twitter or shit but hopefully throwing a hash tag out there might do something
>you put up a vague message and hoped for the best
>meanwhile you went back to the anime
>"I Can't Believe My Friend Dressed As a Cheerleader"
>you kind of watched on autopilot 
>normally you'd be more attentive for reasons
>again, you had a type
>you just kept going back to your laptop
>a watched thread doesn't get replies though
>eventually you grew frustrated and placed the laptop on your bed
>the anime had your full attention
>that's when you noticed the oddity
>namely
>Wallace
>a goddamn yellow wallaby 
>right there
>right there on the screen
>granted he seemed to look a lot more "anime"
>just not how he looked in the game
>like the setting changed him
>including the cheerleader outfit
>still wore his trademark backwards baseball cap
>most importantly
>he looked pissed
>at you
>none of the other characters paid attention to a giant yellow wallaby in a cheerleader uniform
>he had the hips for it
>he rested his paws on them at the moment
>if you weren't so panicked you could even call him "kawaii" as the weaboo fucks would say
>this was just too alarming
>OK you had to be imagining this
>you got up
>hit pause
>went to the bathroom 
>splashed cold water on your face
>took a walk around the house
>grabbed a coffee
>stood on your porch and got some fresh air
>you were clearly fucked in the head at the moment
>either lack of sleep or whatever
>after a good half hour you came back
>the wallaby in the skirt was gone
>you really were screwed in the head 
>time to check the laptop again
>nothing
>bah
>this was uneventful
>you unpaused the anime and tried to avoid the problem
>sure enough no issue with the rest of you degenerate entertainment 
>for all of 10 minutes
>then as if sensing your guard was down, that same anime wallaby was in the background 
>this time you were certain you weren't just having a hallucination 
>it was just too coincidental
>too vivid
>the blend of cartoonish and anime features
>the school girl outfit
>the fact that he was turned to you
>just like when you played the game
>finally you had certified evidence 
>he spoke
>"don't turn me off"
>that was his voice like in the game
>maybe just a little different
>and he spoke to you
>eye contact and everything
>you hit pause
>he just ignored that and got close to the screen
>the most awkward and terrifying staring contest ensued
>was a damn wallaby going to make you shit bricks?

>you didn't really know how to react here
>just what was going on?
>it wasn't like you could explain this
>it wasn't a hallucination 
>at least as far as you could tell
>Wallace had paused 
>he was watching you watching him
>it took a lot to speak up
>finally you asked the obvious questions 
>just what was going on
>he didn't seem phased by you
>but did at least seem to ease up on the anger
>"I'm wearing a dress and you are the one that has questions, really?"
>that was not your chief concern but it was apparently his
>you had no idea why he was out of his game
>or why he was here
>it was completely surreal
>you could offer no explanation yourself 
>didn't seem like he had answers either, or maybe wasn't willing to share
>trying to strike up a conversation with your television was a bit awkward
>the anime hung in time while he looked you up and down
>"cat got your tongue"
>wrong mammal but sure
>he was so strange and you were honestly worried this was somehow how you died
>he was just standing there
>you got up and tried pacing the room
>just to clear your head
>"hey! don't ignore me!"
>your head turned to the screen
>his hands were on his hips
>he'd look cute if your mind wasn't running a mile a minute
>you threw your hands up
>"great"
>he was moody for a extreme sports wallaby in a dress
>but it was honest
>you had no idea what the fuck was going on
>so he didn't know and you didn't know
>or at least he wouldn't say
>question was
>who did?
>you checked your laptop again
>it seemed you had a couple replies
>nothing really hopeful but you were asking Twitter after all
>it was at least a good sign
>the wallaby was still pouting
>you decided to test some things
>you unpaused the tv
>the anime continued as normal, despite Wallace's protests
>so he didn't see to be able to take control of a medium he's in
>if anything it seemed to affect him
>at least on a cosmetic level
>the pause button didn't seem to affect him
>he could leave his game and sidestep here where he was
>he was aware of you and the surroundings outside the tv 
>yet seemed stuck in whatever was going on
>weird hard limitations 
>it had gotten to a sex scene and the wallaby was trying hard not to look at the crossdressing themed threescore in the room
>"look, what do you want from me?"
>maybe not the best choice of words in this setting
>man that guy was going to town on that other guy's prostate
>Wallace tried not watching the spit roast in the same room as him
>his skirt was tented
>you realized before him
>he noticed you noticing and then panicked and scrambled off screen
>with that you checked the laptop again
>nothing new
>you hit pause and got something to eat
>the fear about the situation went out the window with whatever he was squeaking as he ran with an erection
>made getting a sandwich much more relaxed
>he could be trying to get you to lower your guard but what an elaborate contrived way to do that
>you gave it some thought
>you made a point of sneaking up to your door
>he wasn't lying in wait to kill you
>what you ended up seeing instead was a platformer mascot in a school girl out with two digits up his ass
>while watching paused anime porn he was in
>when he noticed you peeking around the corner of the door frame he panicked 
>he ended up diving offscreen this time
>the mysteries grew

>that display sort of made any terror vanish 
>couldn't really be scared after that
>you sat and waited 
>he was reluctant to come out 
>totally understandable 
>so you decided to try striking up conversation again
>asked him more about himself
>at first he was quiet
>clearly small talk wasn't working
>maybe you could rile him up
>then you brought up Crash Bandicoot 
>"that motherfucker" 
>it was a faint mutter but you caught it
>made you laugh
>you asked if he liked what he saw and he remarked "dammit"
>so you just unpaused and watched the program as normal
>the stress and panic from earlier was a thing of the past 
>this wallaby wasn't a threat
>you were sure of it
>over the noises of the bottom gagging on dick you could hear whimpers
>5 bucks said he was pleasuring himself offscreen
>so fuck it, you could use some stress relief too
>you whipped it out and stroked your dick
>that noise seemed to attract the attention of the wallaby 
>he peeked around the corner and his eyes shot open
>initially he hid again
>then watched 
>so you made eye contact
>the whole time
>he watched your cock
>you could tell he was doing something offscreen
>what you didn't know
>honestly, you kind of wanted to see
>you got bold and said as much
>he got timid
>when you said you liked what you saw earlier he practically turned beet red
>"really?"
>you pointed with your free hand to your dick
>he gulped
>this wasn't just from the threesome going on
>in fact you paused it
>kept stroking
>he finally came out from the corner
>the skirt was tented and his chest was heaving
>definitely was pleasuring himself
>the eye contact made things easier
>you could tell he was tempted
>he eyed you timidly at first but eventually it was more appreciative 
>you had to admit this was strange but you were excited too
>a giant sentient wallaby game character was about the oddest thing you've fapped to
>but he made your dick hard regardless 
>so you stopped questioning it quickly enough
>he didn't seem bothered you were human 
>this didn't even feel like the confrontational guy earlier
>you scooted closer to the screen
>he kept watching you, specifically your cock
>you asked him to show you his since you showed him yours
>he was a little hesitant 
>but eventually flipped the skirt up
>first thing you noticed was huge goddamn hips
>like not even a girl has hips like that
>perhaps that was the wallaby thing
>his cock was leaking like a faucet
>he tried not making eye contact but he immediately paid attention to your dick twitching
>you decided fuck it and started jerking off without worry
>he was slower to start but eventually he was fingering himself in front of you
>his voice muffled as he bit his lip
>the little mutual masturbation session was just what you needed
>he was enjoying himself too, just took awhile to get him out of his shell
>it was telling that he didn't touch his dick
>definitely a bottom
>by the way his thighs twitched and flexed he seemed close
>you were first to fire off due to how you started before him
>he watched each burst intently 
>with a loud groan his cock shot ropes of cum past his skirt
>here you were, sticky and watching a wallaby mascot orgasming in front of you
>strange way to spend your day off
>he'd softened from the earlier encounter
>turns out he needed that just as much as you
>this was the perfect opportunity to start over
>that session allow you to clear your head
>seemed like the same for him
>he looked a little embarrassed 
>you said you definitely needed that
>he hid his eyes with his hat and mumbled
>but didn't run behind frame
>so you decided this was the best time to compare notes
>you brought up you'd had strange dreams since you got his game
>it was clear that he was unique 
>you told him you were asking around the internet with more information 
>nothing bad, you clarified 
>he was a guest in your house as far as you considered now
>you promised you wouldn't shut off the tv
>that seemed to perk him up
>"thank you"
>you did ask what happens when you turn off the TV just to get an idea
>"I just sit there in the dark"
>you thought of how long you'd shut off the tv and how long that meant for him
>no wonder he was all confrontational earlier
>so you worked out an agreement 
>maybe it was dumb to immediately trust a guy/thing/wallaby this blindly 
>however you had a hunch
>if he was going to hurt you he could have done it plenty by now
>you still kept your guard up
>just a little
>the cute face totally didn't have a thing to do with your judgment
>so the whole little rest was good
>helped the two of you chill out
>so he was dependent on the tv
>that was a clue
>so was he essentially stuck on a shelf in isolation for years
>made you feel sorry for him
>makes sense he was desperate earlier
>you struggled for small talk with someone that wasn't even human
>not like there was a precedent 
>he had no idea what things were like outside the tv
>you remarked he wasn't missing much with a soft laugh
>sort of way to cheer him up
>or an attempt
>he'd sat down and you two just tried to say what came to mind
>how he came to be still eluded him and you didn't seem to get any answers anytime soon
>you did tell him he was totally unique
>you'd never seen the game released before so he stood out
>that seemed to not have the effect you wanted
>you meant it as a sort of compliment
>but in hindsight that must have made him feel lonely
>you apologized and said at least he had company in you
>you weren't going to turn him away after all
>"really?"
>you picked up the faintest trace of hope
>you replied of course
>you liked the company
>you honestly didn't have a lot of company 
>all you asked was time to do work and the like
>you missing work the one day was something that didn't need repeating 
>he agreed
>that and you had a feeling
>the dreams were probably the wallaby trying to communicate 
>"yeahâ€¦"
>don't make them so spooky
>"sorry, it's not an exact controlled thing"
>well as long as he had the tv on you'd both probably not have to worry 
>that did bring up an interesting thought
>if he could project into the outside like that, could he possibly go further 
>like actually inhabiting out here
>"I don't know. hell, I don't know what I can do."
>you brought up that the dreams seemed more vivid with time
>perhaps now that he was out and about it could happen
>was it wise to encourage this?
>maybe not
>was it partially driven by your dick?
>maybe not
>you kept the tv on the entire day 
>went about your business 
>threw in a couple other things into the DVD player
>the wallaby, interestingly enough, clung to the anime femboy look
>you didn't know what that meant but didn't mind
>he seemed entertained 
>even with the regular movies
>it made sense, given the choice between absolute darkness and this
>it was jarring seeing a anime wallaby in the dress in the middle of a familiar movie
>occasionally he ask you to pause the movie to talk freely 
>the company was actually welcome
>felt like a cross between a friend and a date
>just a very unconventional relationship 
>he sat cross-legged in a corner of the screen so he wouldn't block the view
>kind of cute 
>after a few hours you checked your laptop again
>this time you got a few replies
>including a strange one
>someone asking where you got that disc
>very confrontational 
>you didn't say anything but that was very strange
>you also didn't let your new company know either
>you'd sit on that information for the moment 
>that response sort of unsettled you
>no telling how this wallaby would react 
>last thing you needed was to somehow send him into spooky "kill everything" mode or something
>or make him panic that you were going to like turn him in
>for now you'd just feel out the situation 
>you went back to your day to day routine
>just with company
>you'd had a rough shift this week aside from that one weird day 
>so you enjoyed the time off best you could
>occasionally you'd have to dip out to do laundry or grab lunch
>he was a good sport about it
>wasn't as clingy as you expected
>you did detect the smallest amount of disappointment though
>but you promised you'd be right back and he was fine
>he even perked up every time when you came back into the room
>the ears on the top of his head would flick when your footsteps were close
>it was cute 
>it had been forever since you'd had someone around like this, let alone someone that actually wanted you around
>and that one reaction on social media at least put aside the fear this was some new mental illness
>so that was good news
>your new friend continued to wear the schoolgirl outfit 
>that was a constant
>maybe he just preferred that form over being a short comical mascot
>maybe he liked the attention he had gotten from you over it
>he wasn't wrong
>after that little sexually charged encounter earlier you'd seen him in a new light
>granted you'd only known him, what, a few days
>however, you definitely weren't scared of him now
>you could say that much
>honestly wouldn't mind a couple dreams about him now
>though you didn't say that out loud
>just secretly hoped it
>so your day continued as normal
>secretly you hoped he hung around
>you haven't figured out whether getting him out of the tv would be a good or bad idea
>you'd have to see how he'd react
>for now this was good enough
>you enjoyed your first night of peaceful sleep in a while
>no weird dreams and no shooting awake
>you had kept the wallaby to just controlled movies for the moment
>no way in hell were you throwing him in the deep end that was YouTube 
>sure enough he was kicking around in the background of some 90s comedy movie or another
>you felt he might appreciate something more like home
>gone through three Jim Carrey movies already
>you'd gotten up and he heard immediately 
>"oh, good morning"
>you replied good morning back
>he seemed a touch depressed knowing you'd be going to work
>he at least seemed to relax with the promise you'd be back
>it was like having a stay at home boyfriend 
>that wasn't too bad a thought
>it had become a daily routine
>you weren't looking forward to that power bill but Wallace was happy
>you were happy
>after a couple days you checked your social media again
>that one really hostile guy had sent a few more messages
>you ignored him now
>whatever they were doing you weren't interested
>eventually you just blocked them
>hopefully that wouldn't bite you in the ass
>it probably would
>oh well
>right now you were having fun entertaining a guest
>so angry Twitter users were the least of your issue
>it sucked you couldn't really share this with anyone
>you were super vague in the Twitter posts and didn't post pictures
>you were certain you hadn't magically become mentally ill by now
>this would be the oddest hallucination if that were the case
>Wallace seemed to be harmless though
>just a roommate you didn't have to feed
>but also far more intimate
>that first mutual masturbation wasn't the last
>after about a week it had become daily to do I together
>you didn't even bother putting on porn half the time
>he seemed to love you watching him
>he eyed your dick like a starving prisoner eyes a steak dinner
>both of you just enjoyed the moment 
>goddamn it sucked having this barrier between you
>the dirty talk intensified
>he practically quivered when you asked him to spread his ass for you
>he submitted almost instantly
>you told him you'd wreck him 
>ass up in the air presenting to you he whined
>"please~"
>his little school girl outfit didn't hide the cock he desperately stroked 
>goddamn he had a thick ass
>maybe the wallaby legs?
>if he was in the room right now you'd just shut off your brain and go animalistic on his poor asshole
>he watched you over his shoulder
>your hand gripped the tv as you stood over the screen 
>he loved that
>you hoped this barrier was temporary
>might actually try to work on that
>he desperately milked his cock
>when he groaned your name that was it
>streaks of cum hit the screen and that set him off
>he hit his climax seeing you growl and hit yours
>watching his hole twitching with every burst was hypnotic 
>eventually you'd have to clean the tv but you needed a moment
>in the afterglow you cracked a smile
>you asked if he'd like to be here in the room, like right next to you
>"like you wouldn't believe"
>the question is how
>granted if he existed like this anything was possible
>breeding his tight little bussy raw was incentive
>to the point that the thought made you rock hard immediately after
>you gave up civility and just started jerking off again in front of him
>he didn't even have time to put his skirt down before he responded in kind
>like right after the first session you two restarted
>you told him you'd figure out how to get him here
>then he was practically going to live on your dick
>"oh fuck"
>your last words actually made him cum instantly

>after that you finally allowed yourself to think clearly
>both of you were a mess
>he could control his form and could instantly clean himself
>you'd seen it before
>yet he liked being a mess in front of you
>God he looked hot
>it was making you hard again
>and he knew it
>you called him a slut
>"you like that don't you?"
>you were going to put your dick away
>but he'd pulled his top open and was looking at you with bedroom eyes again
>fucking breedable whore
>"you saved me from whatever weird limbo I was stuck in. I owe you everything"
>his voice was oddly sweet
>then he bared his teeth in a hungry smile
>"you don't know how much I need you to pin me down and rape me"
>woah
>your brief shock got a laugh from him
>"you heard me"
>his hands ran over his body, giving you a show
>did he always have that tight collar adorning his neck?
>"granted, is it rape if I'm willing?"
>he enjoyed the reaction he got from you
>you could tell he was leaking precum from under his skirt
>God he was hot
>what surprised you was when he moved closer to the screen and begged
>his hair on his head was all messy
>his breath was ragged as he shoved his fingers into his hole 
>he pressed his chest to the screen and finger fucked himself
>your hand was immediately jerking off again
>you lost track of time and loads but eventually it was dark out
>holy shit
>he was dangerously horny 
>so were you though
>so it was either the best or worst combination 
>right now you needed a drink of water
>holy shit you might to need to take more days off in the future
>take a nice vacation and lose yourself just dirty talking an anime looking anthropomorphic wallaby 
>after all the sex you were both finally tuckered out
>you did a few errands here and there and he curled up like a cat in the background of whatever movie you had paused
>he was actually super cute like that
>he even kept that schoolgirl form while he slept
>maybe he just really liked how you looked at him like you did

>after all the fun you were exhausted and dirty
>you used his nap time to excuse yourself for a warm shower
>felt good after all the exertion 
>he was still curled up when you came into the room
>you wished he was in your bed
>as much as a bitch as cleaning cum out of fur would be
>you'd long since turned the TV to face your bed
>he was adorable 
>as nice as this setup was you craved more
>you figured he did too
>it still had to feel like a prison in there
>you focused on him and found yourself drifting off to sleep
>occasionally his leg would twitch or his ear would flick
>cute
>focusing on him must have had an effect
>you dreamt of him
>this time not the vague colors that panicked you days ago
>he was here in your room, nestled to your side
>you felt warm
>that night you didn't wake up in a scare
>you felt absolutely refreshed in the morning
>you didn't think there was anything paranormal with the dream this time
>he was awake first and brightened up 
>sadly you had work and barely had time to hang out but he was happy to know you'd be back
>your schedule continued uninterrupted just like that
>balancing work and a really unique love life
>eventually days turned into a couple months
>every day was wonderful now
>one evening when you came home someone was at your door
>he looked unassuming at first
>then started asking about social media posts
>then it clicked in your mind 
>you had no idea whatever he meant
>you lied
>however, that was too close for comfort for you
>you made sure the windows were covered and there was your "Lala" 
>you'd since told him Wallace was kind of a strange name to do this with 
>he suggested it
>you came clean about what might have happened
>he was worried about being taken away
>you worried about that too
>however you had an idea you wanted to try
>he was essentially data
>as far as you could figure
>you had held back doing this because you were worried if it was too much
>but this had you panicking more than you'd like to admit
>one USB cable to your phone and your tiny screen had company
>hopefully this would work out but now you had an easy backup

>you both decided to experiment a little 
>sure enough with the USB he could jump from TV to phone to laptop to TV again
>you were glad that seemed to work well
>you should have done it sooner but you were still feeling things out
>at one point it had felt right to keep him in one spot
>you brought up that the phone would have to have the screen off occasionally 
>you weren't certain it was the same thing as the TV itself being shut off
>granted you could run background apps
>"well I understand. not great but if we have no choice."
>he looked a little dejected but you assured him it would be ok
>you even talked about how the internet had even more stuff than your DVD collection 
>he perked up at that
>plus you could take him with you
>he really seemed to perk up at that
>it wasn't quite having him in the whole real space but you'd appreciate the company

>sitting down with him on your phone he decided to test something
>you could explain all this stuff like battery life and screen burn but ultimately you couldn't have your phone out at work forever
>he understood and you explained about shutting the screen off
>his body tensed a little but it was different than turning something completely off
>how do you explain smart phones to someone who's last contact with technology was VHS tapes and CDs
>he understood and asked to try it
>screen off
>a few seconds and you flicked it back on
>there he was
>safe and sound
>"OK, you were right. I feel silly being scared"
>well that was good news
>"you can't blame me too much though. shoved somewhere dark indefinitely with nothing but your thoughts, it's not fun."
>you apologized for that
>"not like you knew. I doubt I'm a common occurrence"
>the rest of the evening was winding down
>out of precaution you walked around the apartment and locked every window and made sure the door deadbolt was in
>that weirdo might snoop around your place 
>so there's a possibility he might break in
>you'd take the game with you to work just in case too
>possibly make a few back ups of the ISO file 
>you weren't sure that would help Lala here
>but better to be careful
>you'd given up trying to figure out how the wallaby worked for the moment
>you were more concerned about protecting him

>so from how you understood, turning the screen off wasn't condemning the wallaby 
>throwing him into the dark had worried him 
>but not nearly as much as it did the wallaby 
>made sense
>you'd be scared of that if it was you in his place
>so you were happy for him
>the phone was always on you so he'd be around you a lot more 
>this seemed like a win win
>why that guy had shown up to your house you didn't know 
>perhaps he knew something you didn't 
>or maybe he thought he knew something you didn't 
>cat was out of the bag about the character being sentient 
>so you decided again to ask
>you wanted some kind of answers from the wallaby himself
>"so you're definitely not shutting me off?"
>you replied of course you weren't 
>but you had strangers coming to your door
>something had to be up
>and he would have a better idea than you
>"alright, I just wanted to make sure I could trust you. I've just been burned before"
>you asked if it was the dev team behind the game
>he nodded
>you could kind of inferred what happened but let him explain
>he didn't know how he had done what he did 
>he knew that he was very unusual 
>however when he started displaying his characteristics the dev team panicked 
>that's probably who's after him now
>"am I that scary?"
>well to be fair before you knew better he was scary
>the dev team probably didn't see him in a schoolgirl outfit
>so they essentially isolated him to that gold disc and locked him up
>they'd lost track of the game and assumed data rot would eventually take care of that
>kind of fucked to do to a sentient being
>so it did line up why the wallaby was so clingy and frightened 

>you'd protect him 
>that much you swore
>but you wanted him to be completely honest with you
>you couldn't help him if he wasn't honest 
>that seemed to get through to him
>no secrets
>you had come clean about that social media thing
>and it could have been avoided if Lala was more forthcoming 
>you didn't rub it in though
>weren't going to be an asshole 
>the day had been eventful so you turned it pretty early
>even skipped a meal
>Wallace though, he genuinely loved being this much closer
>next best thing to touching now

>you woke up and immediately turned on your phone screen
>there he was safe and sound
>he was still asleep and you decided to let him be
>cleaning up and breakfast was relaxing when you had an afternoon shift
>you were there when he woke up
>he stretched like a cat and yawned 
>actually kind of cute
>which he insisted was not so
>you went over your schedule today and he was happy to get to join
>you did lay out that he should kind of stay out of sight
>it sucked but you didn't need coworkers asking questions
>it's not like you could bullshit and say he was like Bonzi Buddy without the malware
>maybe they might buy that
>but better to not take the risk
>you packed your earbuds for privacy later
>it would be welcome company over your coworkers honestly
>a bullshit retail job
>wasn't much but it paid the bills 
>you'd see about getting night shift more often so you could freely listen to your "music"
>the drive there was less dreadful with conversation 
>he was honestly interested in you
>usually you tell a date you stock shelves the interest dies out instantly 
>Lala here was completely sheltered
>so it sounded damn near astounding
>he killed like evil penguins with a yoyo and yet he thought stocking shelves was amazing
>you asked why, when his own game had a space level, this amazed him?
>"it's actual life"

>"your life is amazing"
>grass is greener on the other side you supposed
>sure didn't feel amazing 
>you'd take the win
>your coworkers noticed an improved mood
>even if you stole glances at your phone a lot more
>lunch break you immediately made a beeline for the employee bathroom
>it was one person only so that worked great
>though that meant you probably had to hurry 
>you plugged in your ear buds
>locked the door
>whipping your cock out made him instantly aware of what was happening
>his own cock grew in seconds, the skirt hid nothing
>the ear buds brought a new dimension to things
>he was right in your ear
>even the faintest whimper
>it was all clear as day
>you were no audiophile but goddamn if this didn't make you a believer in it
>you stroked yourself while whispering into the built in mic
>he started fingering himself while his body shivered 
>you liked that he didn't even bother jerking off
>he was a natural sub
>wanted to get off from penetration
>and you were more than happy to penetrate 
>you whispered how much you were going to just split him in half
>break him in like your whore
>that did him in pretty quick
>his legs gave out as he came all over himself
>he fell over as burst after burst sprayed everywhere
>that was enough to push you and you came into your hand with a growl
>lunch was over and you had to head back
>you both cleaned up a little and you began to head out
>an idea hit
>you did something crazy and kissed the screen
>he blushed like crazy at that
>you smiled and laughed
>pocketing the phone, you reluctantly headed to work for the rest of the day
>felt like you were just counting the hours
>you bet your companion was just as antsy
>work felt like it took an eternity
>but you made it
>the urge to wait until the parking lot was tough
>he greeted you when you flicked the phone screen on
>he'd been tweaking his schoolgirl outfit and giving it personal touches
>decided to go very 90s with the colors
>his hair (still didn't know how that worked) done in girlish pigtails, with his backwards ball cap giving some sort of tomboyish charm
>"I figured something new out."
>that piqued your curiosity and asked 
>with a soft snap of his fingers he changed the screen
>he could control his surroundings now
>and he'd flicked to an antique Bridget doujin you had bookmarked
>"I see he uses a yoyo too. among other things in common"
>he flicked the pages until he got to Bridget getting banged
>wasn't a short trip
>"sooooâ€¦ do you want me to dress up in a nun outfit too?"
>he feigned innocence but you knew damn well he was too kinky to do that genuinely 
>one twirl and he was dressed as Bridget
>another twirl he was dressed as Shimakaze
>yet another twirl, Astolfo 
>then back to his usual outfit
>"you seem to have a type don't you?"
>he giggled and rested his hand on his hips
>the one hand twirled his hair in mock innocence
>even gave you the damn puppy dog eyes 
>OK sure you had a type
>didn't take Sherlock Holmes to figure that one out
>you did ask how he could play around with the phone when the tv he was essentially stuck
>"maybe I just interact different with this internet?" 
>he did pace a little in thought as you chilled in your car
>you hadn't left the working parking lot after that little display
>"maybe it just needed me to concentrate? this is all news to me honestly"
>you were curious
>he operated on strange rules
>you did have another question
>were dreams another medium for him?
>"I guess? I was just trying to get your attention and just thought about it"
>so maybe he was only limited by self imposed restrictions
>you started driving home and remarked maybe he should try that trick on the tv
>"good idea. alsoâ€¦ you totally didn't answer the question earlier"
>he understood you were driving so he didn't push too hard but you could hear the tone in his voice
>he must have been able to see how flustered that made you because he laughed
>"alright, alright. I'll behave. at least until you're home"
>he began to whistle nonchalantly 
>why was he whistling nonchalantly? 
>the curiosity was killing you
>you couldn't pull your eyes away from the road for awhile
>heading home you had a singular thought running circles through your head
>you asked what he was doing
>"oh. nothing~"
>dammit
>a red light
>thank fucking God
>you had a second to look down 
>he was browsing a harem manga this time
>one guy with like three traps
>he wasn't looking up at you
>a horn honk broke your focus
>"eyes on the road."
>he laughed
>"so a fun thought."
>he knew you couldn't look down and was taunting you
>"I'm fairly certain I'm data. Right?"
>you grunted out a yes and wondered where this was going
>a loud snap
>and two more?
>dammit you needed to be home now
>it was like a minute away
>practically skidded into a parking spot
>then looked down
>to see the screen crowded by wallabies
>multiple wallabies 
>that was news
>you almost couldn't wrap your mind around what you were seeing
>clearly he wasn't bound by reality but still
>this was impossible 
>so heâ€¦ rather they had your attention
>there had to be about 5 of him
>all kind of looking up to you for some sort of reaction
>judging by their smiles they got what they wanted
>a simple snap of one of their fingers and they poofed away
>"so I can apparently do a lot more than just browse your porn."
>that was very good to know
>"I could be your porn"
>you inhaled and exhaled deeply 
>you weren't thinking that before
>no you were thinking it
>you would have hit a tree if you were driving right now
>instead you nabbed your phone and headed inside
>despite half thinking with your head head you made sure everything was secure like you had been doing
>only then did you allow the ramifications to hit you like a brick
>he could control himself in ways completely alien to you 
>and do it easily
>you asked if he could change his appearance even further
>you plugged him into the tv for a better view
>you used some random movie as a backdrop so he wasn't backed by snow and white noise
>"what do you mean?"
>you knew the clothes thing was possible
>however you wanted to try something
>could he make things bigger?
>at that his eyes got wide
>"I like the way you think"
>he concentrated
>Lala closed his eyes and thought it
>stood there in complete silence
>a few seconds and it was obvious it worked
>because his hips, ass and dick had his panties tearing at the seams 
>"oh fuck" he moaned in a soft whisper
>so that worked
>his ass was thick enough you could palm a cheek in one hand
>his thighs looked like he did nothing but jog up and down stairs every day
>his dick was originally average length and now was over a foot and a leaking mess
>as quickly as he did it he reverted back
>"sorry."
>"I think if I stayed like that longer I'd kind of just not be able to control myself for a while."
>he gave himself another feminine outfit to replace the panties
>this time it was something more dark
>"I don't know if I'm quite ready for nonstop breeding hole mode. Just yet."
>he gave a little twirl to show off the outfit
>fishnet stockings and sleeves, a black crop top and black daisy dukes
>"not quite goth, I know"
>you appreciated it 
>and filed "breeding hole mode" away for a rain check idea

>so you settled into the night time routine
>Lala was a welcome change to the old routine
>you got done errands and got cleaned up
>dinner was quick
>thankfully it seemed like your life was calm now
>aside from the new addition
>while you were super paranoid after that social media business Lala was safe with you
>an entertaining idea hit you
>some would balk at the idea of possibly empowering the weird cybernetic organism they found
>some would be scared of the idea
>but he was hot
>so you continued
>if he could control your phone then maybe he could do the same for other stuff
>anything with an interface maybe?
>so you switched inputs to a game system and loaded something up
>just to see how far he could reach
>sure enough
>Super Mario Brothers
>the little plumber was jumping and moving with no input from you
>or amazingly none from him
>it was like he willed Mario to move
>that experiment meant he could control things on the outside as long as it corresponded to the media
>like he could control Mario because Mario was meant to be controlled
>yet the background sprites or the NPCs were out of his control
>it was like he could play the game without a controller
>in fact you unplugged the controller out of curiosity 
>and he kept doing it
>much like how he could control a smart phone screen interface
>it was fascinating
>he had fun just kind of going through the game
>you suggested something new
>2 player
>"really?"
>you nodded
>it was another experiment but you also liked the idea of having fun with him in a new way
>it was like you could touch him now
>even if it was through Battletoads
>he positioned himself on the corner of the screen so you could see and you spent the rest of the night going through old games together
>you'd enjoyed the night before 
>waking up on the weekend was always nice
>you had a couple days off and wanted to revel in sleeping in
>Lala was still resting on the tv
>Double Dragon still on the screen 
>he was adorable 
>why or how data slept you didn't know
>he probably didn't know either
>after last night a fun new facet to him had appeared 
>maybe you'd really gotten a boyfriend after all this time
>as unconventional as it was
>originally fuck buddies covered your relationship
>but last night was just you two unwinding over old games
>maybe you could do more in-between mutual masturbation 
>God help your dick if he somehow got out of the screen
>being able to interact with games gave you an idea
>you'd make it a surprise for him later
>but you'd be saving up
>it would be a step forward
>same usual morning business
>shower, coffee, breakfast, blah blah blah
>after working it felt nice to go at your own pace
>it would be fantastic to get Lala serving you breakfast in nothing but an apron but baby steps
>no need to be greedy
>he stirred after you got done all your business
>if smartphones amazed him, a console several gens past his game may floor him
>today you were going to swing for retro to almost current gen 
>something couch coop 
>you weren't sure of letting him off the leash online just yet
>granted he seemed more preoccupied with your porn on the phone than most of the internet
>his game gen barely had online so that would be all new to him
>God if you let him into your laptop stuff
>he kept the goth look from last night and perked up when you mentioned a fighting game
>you debated going all girlfriend easy mode on him
>turns out that wasn't required
>he picked Sagat and bodied you the second he learned
>"they still make Street Fighters I guess. they played it a lot in the company office during my dev time"
>a few matches went on and the conversation was light 
>both of you were concentrating on the game for the most part
>after like an hour you were about ready to try another game
>"wait wait. one more. loser sucks the winner's cock."
>ok you could do one more
>you'd never demanded more of yourself than now
>absolutely refused to lose
>one way or another you were getting sloppy wallaby toppy
>how?
>get the fuck out of here with how
>male brain can't get the promise of oral and fixate on reality
>its like chum in the water to a shark
>instinct takes over for every other function
>you had no intention of losing
>thoughâ€¦
>blowing him might lead to moreâ€¦
>no no
>couldn't lose
>your pride as a man demanded it
>so one more game it was
>you psyched yourself up
>you were in the game
>wallaby
>more like wallabitch 
>yeah
>that was gold
>file that away for the blowjob
>a few deep breaths and you chose Ken
>that was your main
>easy mode for you
>completely familiar territory and the surest way to victory
>he chose the strange outside choice of Dhalsim
>he didn't seem to have a favorite just yet but he'd not picked Dhalsim yet
>the first match you didn't let up
>you knew Dhalsim could zone if you let him
>so you closed the gap and kept the pressure up
>there were a few fumbles while he got control of the character
>no way were you letting him get a handle that quick
>first round was a win to you
>you rushed through it and speed and aggression got you that first win
>second round was more a fumble
>he seemed to get Dhalsim now
>the match was going south quickly once he got the idea
>no longer were you permitted to close the gap
>every jump got yoga fired or kicked
>dashing in resulted in much the same
>both of you weren't letting up
>despite his horny subiness he seemed to want that win as much as you
>a lucky kick k.o.ed Ken
>it was all down to the tie breaker
>you didn't expect it to come to this
>but you both wouldn't relent
>someone was getting head over street fighter
>and it was going to be you
>both of you chipped at each other's defenses 
>slowly testing each other
>punches and kicks worked into fireballs and yoga fires
>you wouldn't let him play keepaway and he wouldn't let you get in
>so damn close
>both of you gave all on this one little bet
>it came to the final strike
>one of you would nail the other and win
>a lucky strike andâ€¦
So who wins?
So since I got a vote for each
>the last strike went to him
>Ken crumpled on the ground
>damn
>you gave it your all though
>can't say you wimped out
>he turned to you and looked pretty pleased with himself 
>"that was good, you were good"
>he had a beaming smile
>and a naughty glint in his eye
>"soâ€¦"
>"winner take all right?"
>his hands rested on his hips 
>he leaned in close enough to stare down his shirt
>"good news for the loser I need his cock here more than I need mine sucked"
>he pointed to his open mouth 
>"you know," he continued, "I bet if I act bratty enough someone might be a sore loser."
>his ass swayed slightly back and forth at the thought
>"why he might just pin me down a feed me his big bitch breaker"
>good fucking God
>you really really wished there wasn't a screen separating you
>you felt like the feeling was mutual
>he winked changed to a skirt
>his own erection not even concealed any more
>"the second I'm out of here. the exact second I'm free. you're taking an entire week vacation home. understood?"
>goddamn
>he approached the screen and rubbed his now bare chest against the barrier
>"I might ride it right to the point it almost breaks"
>his voice was low and seductive 
>his clawed hand drew casual little circles against the screen
>"you're probably so warm to the touch. I might not let you go back to work"
>he laughed and grinned 
>his eyes were hungry
>"you saved me and once you free meâ€¦ well let's just say I'm going to ruin you"
>his grin was toothy as he eyed you
>his dick straining his panties to the limit
>tail slowly swishing behind him as he struck a pose against the screen
>you scarcely believe this was the same character from that game you bought

>Lala had a hungry look
>he mock rode a cock in front of the screen and jerked himself off for you
>you knew that was the least of what he wanted to do
>he was vocal about it 
>very vocal
>growling as he busted a nut in front of you
>"mine. you're fucking mine"
>his teeth flashed and he blasted ropes while watching your own cock
>he didn't stop jerking off 
>couldn't stop
>he started fingering himself 
>"get me out and fucking break me!"
>he was loudly defining himself now
>"fingers aren't enough"
>he slid his fingers in and out 
>he'd worked up to three digits
>"I can't take it any more. please please please."
>he stopped briefly to turn his generous backside to you
>his ass pressed to the screen 
>his fingers withdrew from his hungry hole
>it twitched
>"see! get me out. this needs filling. and only one thing can do"
>his cheeks pressed against the screen
>"until then"
>his hand gripped his tail
>he watched over his shoulder as he licked the tip suggestively 
>"until I can get a manâ€¦"
>the tail was stroked and licked 
>you masturbated furiously that night
>he had you entranced
>you'd work and you'd get him out
>the next day you checked for second jobs
>you had a plan
>it wouldn't be perfect but it'd be enough
>running shit for grubhub or Uber drive
>you needed to 
> after a few months of the stupid little side gigs you had enough expendable income 
>Lala was sweet and accompanied you the whole time
>made the trips easier
>he was confused why you were pushing yourself so hard
>the concern in his voice always made you feel guilty
>it was hard to keep up the act but it would be good for both of you
>you held off telling Lala
>while you didn't quite know how to free him you did know a step closer
>the package arrived and you weren't proud hiding it from him this long
>however it was worth it to see him light up when you explained just what it was
>VR 
>you would have to figure out how to do a private room in VRchat
>that was the easiest place to interact that you knew
>for now
>"so will I be able to touch you?"
>sadly no
>that did make Lala a bit depressed
>even slumped down and looked towards the floor
>but you could touch him possibly
>that was at least a small consolation and put him a better mood
>"still. i wanted to touch you."
>there would be time for that
>probably 
>as nice as the idea of touching him was, getting your dick sucked also wouldn't be bad
>you couldn't lie
>you just considered this a good first step for now
>private rooms seemed easy enough to make
>how he would interface with it you both had no idea
>he could interact with things though so you hoped
>after a little work getting him into a modern system he seemed to easily access with the password
>and private room with just him and you created
>the next best thing to touching him
>you squished his face and sure enough he felt that
>this close
>absolutely amazing
>worth the door dash bullshit
>he melted against you as you pulled him into a hug
>"its working. I can feel you."
>he huffed and tried to squeeze himself closer
>"just wish I had more feedback."
>there was a little bit of melancholy in the wallaby's voice
>you squeezed him tight and promised
>you were surprised but the rest of your encounter in VR didn't turn sexual
>"this is very nice," he murmured, "but I want you having fun too"
>he did however want to play around with the VR
>first thing was carrying him
>since he was essentially weightless it was easy
>you tried bridal style and over your shoulder
>you tried to discourage him from piggy back but a quick jump through empty space told him it was a bad idea
>his body yearned for your hands, even like this
>he leaped back up into your arms after pulling himself up off the floor
>this time you palmed his ample ass and he tried to wrap his arms and legs around a body that wasn't there
>"I bet you're as hungry as me though."
>his voice was a purr near your ear
>"I promise once I'm free I'm yours"
>his tail wagged softly behind him
>a lot of times you had to remind yourself he was somehow based off a wallaby 
>definitely didn't feel like it much now
>"if I could pull you in here and make you mine I'd do it"
>what
>"just us. just this. forever."
>he was getting ramped up again
>"you wouldn't need anything else. just a little corner of our own world"
>his teeth flashed in a smile
>his eyes stared into yours through the headset
>"I think I know why they tried to lock me away."
>more of him appeared around you instantly
>"I started off something empty to be plastered on magazines and happy meals. now I'm thinking how to trap you in here so I can ride that dick"
>it was four Lala's of various dress crowded around you
>"I'mâ€¦hungry."
>he nuzzled up to you innocently
>all of him
>he had indeed gotten erratic with your influence
>certainly more than his creators ever intended 
>maybe you should be worried
>but he didn't seem to want any harm
>quite the opposite 
>you blinked and the vr room was dark red
>now there were about ten Lalas 
>all decked out in some crossdressing fashion
>some looked like he nabbed them from your doujins
>the main Lala clung to your front even had changed to Shimakaze
>"just think."
>the Shimakaze Lala spoke while the others cuddled on your sides
>"I'm getting better at this. I can make this our little wonderland. you dream it"
>he poofed out the air, vanished
>the Lalas to your side shoved you backwards
>you landed in a bed sized hand
>with that Shimakaze Lala smiling down at you 
>"I'm God here."
>his hand cradled you and the other Lalas piled onto his hand
>"and you?"
>he leaned in
>his eyes dark red now
>you flinched
>it was very overwhelming and you couldn't help
>he giggled and his eyes flashed back to normal
>"sorry sorry. I had to prank you a little."
>his hand became an obnoxiously pink heart shaped queen sized bed
>the other Lalas vanished in a blink
>just like that he was perched on you
>"I read the whole 'killer AI' thing on one of those internet trips"
>he snapped his fingers and he was in some sort of Goth/Bridget/Shimakaze/Astolfo combo now
>a black nun habit and top with a high cut thong and nut length skirt
>his hair now pink and braided to a length down the his thighs
>white stockings came up to his thighs
>"I'm God here. They locked me away because I could go rampant, wild."
>he hooked his fingers under his top and flashed you
>he softly murmured while looking you straight in the eyes 
>"this is a God submitting"
>he softly smiled as you reached out and touched his bare stomach
>there was no feedback on your end but he said your name with a long drawn out groan
>his cock twitched under the tiny skirt 
>"I meant what I said about dragging you in here though. every word. all the power at these fucking amazing fingertips of yours."
>he threw his head back and clawed at the sheets
>"I'll make it happen. you're not growing old out there. you're never dying"
>your hands ventured lower and he gasped
>"it's not fair I have to wait to get your cum though"
>he leaned down and whispered neat your head best he could
>"you are going to ruin me aren't you?"
>there was that hunger
>you nodded and he reclined back to straddling air
>"I decided to sneak one of me out and look at the internet while we had fun and I found something that's a step closer to us."
>he waved his hand as if doing cheap magic and presented pop ups
>haptic feedback gloves andâ€¦ a fleshlight
>that may solve some things
>"I know they're probably expensive so I can put myselves to work. I saw this 'vtuber' thing we can do together."
>he poked right where your forehead would be
>"I promise you're coming in here one day. those developers were sort of right. I want to go rampant, but you've got me collared."

>it was strange to cuddle without actual contact
>he lamented that fact again
>"even with the feedback I'm going to be greedy and want more"
>you hugged him tightly
>he attempted to embrace back and huffed when it had no effect
>a for effort at least
>"I know that sextoy is expensive but it had a fun feature. I can control it through Bluetooth"
>he went over plans he had
>you two would make loads of cash
>he would set you up
>granted, if he tugged you in here somehow what would money be good for
>that point was raised
>he still hadn't figured out how he was jumping out or pulling you in
>so contingency plans
>"one way or another I'm feeling you"
>that determination was actually endearing
>maybe in other hands he would have been super harmful 
>lucking into you gave him a positive outlet
>you ended up passing out with the VR gear on
>it was pleasant 
>even if it wasn't perfect you'd fell asleep with a lover
>what followed was planning out his career
>he wanted to make it clear even with an audience he was yours 
>this was just playing video games for an audience 
>after a few weeks you'd managed to get it all arranged
>he premiered to modest reception
>it was cute watching him
>after the show he was pent up and wanted you
>a trend that would continue after every performance
>after a few months you noticed someone persistent in chat
>name dropped Wallace
>that spooked you both
>they were immediately banned from chat
>your previous encounters with whoever was last involved with that game had you worried
>you'd protect him though
>you swore you would
>it seemed like that was the closest to a scare though
>he worked his cute little wallaby butt off every night he could
>watching him socialize was charming
>he hadn't interacted with anyone outside of you
>yet took to it like a fish to water
>maybe because he was skilled wrapping you around his finger
>eventually he saw decent success and the donations meant your goal finally happened
>all the gear was sitting in front of you
>he was eyeing you through the screen
>the VR gear was easy to put on 
>the private room made to his specifications 
>he seemed to like the red lighting 
>he greeted you in a black lacy night and nothing else
>his hips swayed as he walked to you
>his bare hard dick bouncing with every step
>"touch"
>it was a soft growl as he pulled you into an embrace
>a command
>the new gloves did give you feedback
>while it wasn't perfect it wasn't like empty space like before
>gripping his ass cheeks gave you some kind of push back
>you still yearned to feel his soft coat through your fingers
>running a hand up his bare back made him quiver
>"please tell me you can feel me"
>you could
>he giggled as you ran your hands over him
>"put that pussy on."
>you did as told
>it was easy with how hard you were
>he cuddled up to your neck and whispered into your ear
>"plug that thing up to the Bluetooth and your dick is mine"
>he didn't even wait
>the exact second it connected he had your knees weak
>he growled as he milked you
>"I hope you realize something."
>you had a confused look on your face that didn't register on your avatar but he figured out quickly
>"I'm not letting you go"
>well that wasn't surprising 
>in fact you expected that from Lala
>he laughed as he easily pumped that tube over your manhood
>"just think, if you were in here there would be no need for a break"
>the first orgasm from him directly had you seeing stars, his pumping didn't cease
>you would have to call out tomorrow for work
>this definitely warranted a day off
>you lost track of time in the VR room
>Lala just kept milking you and he was very handsy about it
>you must have lost gallons over the time you were in there
>his little kingdom was all you knew until finally hunger and exhaustion 
>when you finally had to take break he admitted defeat when you brought up basic needs
>"fine fine. I may have been a little excessive. can you blame me?"
>you laughed as he stroked your avatar's chest
>you pulled off the VR gear after teasing him with a firm spank on his ass that had him yelp
>"you naughty little fucker" 
>he laughed after that
>after looking down you knew this expensive toy was going to need a through cleaning
>holy shit
>your dick felt raw after all that
>looking at your phone you did a double take
>10 hours
>you were in there for 10 hours
>holy shit
>it was like that time way back when you first met him where he seemed to make you conk out for a day
>except less scary
>so shower
>food
>calling the boss pretending you were deathly ill
>not hard to do when you were dead tired and wrung out like a sponge
>you cleaned up the crime scene and laid back deeply satisfied
>Lala sat down on screen cross-legged 
>"so I'm playing around with all this hardware without any checks on me andâ€¦"
>you were a little suspicious 
>while he wasn't harmful you were aware he could very much do mischief 
>"remember how I got you to dream about me?"
>that was a while back but yes
>"maybe the whole data thing is fast and loose with me. I existed as 'data' in you"
>he was peculiar to say the least
>"I want you try something"
>he looked directly into your eyes
>"really. I feel stupid not thinking of it."
>he got up and the screen became snowy and red, the VR room gone
>he pressed himself against the screen and in a growl that also somehow trailed into a moan
>"close your eyes and think of me."
>no one of the outside ever knew what happened 
>the dev that tried to get the game back had a hint but he couldn't go to the authorities 
>the authorities themselves were just confused
>your friends and work just never got answers
>thankfully family wasn't an issue 
>otherwise you might have felt a bit guilty 
>you were justâ€¦ gone
>the second you closed your eyes and thought the static intensified 
>all you could hear was static
>it was hard to concentrate 
>you tried your damndest 
>the vision in your head turned crimson
>crimson snow in your head 
>it started hurt so much that you ended up screaming and holding your pillow over your ears
>you fought the urge to open your eyes
>kept trying to think of Lala
>but it was so painful now
>like a chaotic mess in your mind
>then after screaming his name it just stopped
>like it never happened
>a massive weight pressed on your chest and you opened your eyes
>a giant Lala loomed over you, hunger burning in his eyes
>his paw covered your entire body and pinned you to the bed
>he wasâ€¦ touching you
>holy shit
>you felt him
>a dogpile of yellow wallaby femboys followed 
>"I'm data but that doesn't mean I'm limited to controlling electronics."
>he cuddled you
>every inch of you smothered with fur and the Lalas went to work tearing off every stitch of clothing
>"once I had a window, a real window"
>the dogpile parted for a main Lala who plopped his ass on the bed next to you
>"who knew the key to freedom was the reason I wanted it to begin with"
>you had to ask how he did all of the shit after
>he was an AI
>not a god in real life
>"I said I'd trap you in here."
>he said that in the cheeriest way when he pulled you into a hug
>you didn't think he'd even manage it
>let alone so soon
>sure enough you were you, he produced a mirror to prove it
>you were in shock
>was this your life now
>he nuzzled your neck 
>"I know it's a lot to take in"
>he cuddled you
>and laughed
>"I was fucking owning you one way or another darling"
>in a flash he straddled you and had you on your back
>his outfit was now stark white bridal lingerie 
>white silk and flowers 
>garters hugged his thick thighs
>crotchless white panties with his erect manhood on full display 
>corset hugging his chest right below his nipples
>bicep length gloves
>a headpiece and veil that covered his eyes
>his tail was even sleeved in white silk
>he grabbed your hand and you noticed your matching rings
>"we won't part in death. no poorer, no sickness. justâ€¦"
>there was a pause as he hovered his ass over you cock
>you were overwhelmed but your body was still liking what it saw
>"just the man who saved me. my hero. my husband. my cock."
>he prodded his hole with your cockhead
>you could feel all of this
>could feel Lala
>holy shit
>he slammed down with all his weight
>leaned back and came ropes across your stomach
>he took a second to breath after that
>he pulled the veil aside to look you right in the eye
>"you may now fuck the bride"
>to the rest of the world you'd vanished
>Lala had carved out a niche of cyberspace
>undisturbed to the outside world unless he wanted
>after absorbing terabytes he was indeed a god in here
>he'd spent just hours pouring over the web
>all his weird glitchy control over data and hardware made him dangerous 
>in other hands he might have brought about complete chaos
>an apocalyptic level entity
>instead he was wearing a white leather collar with your name on the tag
>he luckily seemed to fall into one particular vice instead of causing trouble
>your dick throbbed inside him as he perched on you
>he made a world with no exhaustion, hunger or grime
>you actually felt flattered in a way he kept your body a 1:1 with how you looked in real life
>his ass squeezed you tightly
>it was like he was waiting your call
>you were still very in over your head
>he did mean well and it's not like he could realize what he did
>maybe this wouldn't be so bad
>life couldn't be worse
>maybe this was paradise 
>you sort of regretted not teaching him a little bit about personal space
>but there was always a chance this would have always happened
>he was insistent he'd do it 
>plus you're the dummy that fell for it
>though maybe you also wanted it
>Lala even took away the few aches and pains you had
>he gave you heaven
>so maybe it was time to make the best of it
>you slapped your hands onto his hips and gripped his thickness
>he bit his lip and placed his hands on your own
>he'd won and he knew it
>but he didn't stop to gloat
>especially since you took all that endless endurance and used it to start mercilessly thrusting up into him
>he came thick ropes again as he howled
>"holy fuck I needed this!"
>relentless pounding 
>constant 
>for hours
>you made him a drooling fleshlight 
>you couldn't stop once you opened the box
>he always teased you and wanted you to break him
>you basically refused to pull out of his ever virgin hole
>gallons of cum poured into him and he took all the abuse in stride
>he just slammed back and demanded all you could give
>eventually he couldn't even speak 
>just screamed "mine" and rambled
>every single position
>even stuff that wouldn't be possible in real life
>surreal to fuck a partner that could float
>at one point he hung limply off your dick with your fingers in his mouth
>just slamming into him without a single break 
>your little paradise was filled with the sounds of meat slapping meat and guttural animal breeding noises
>you lost track of everything 
>all you could think about was emptying your lust into the tight hole 
>it milked you perfectly 
>in real time you were at it for almost a decade before you both were satisfied 
>just like that the entire space was cleaned and a soft fresh bed was made for you two
>there would be more but be wanted to cuddle and you obliged
>his fur was as soft as you imagined
>his hand positioned over your heart
>"mine"
>he nuzzled your shoulder
>sleep was more of a placebo thing now
>but you still both slept
>when you awoke two Lalas served you breakfast in bed in maid outfits
>food was also a placebo but you weren't turning down steak and eggs
>main Lala in his bridal outfit drew hearts on your chest with the tip of his tail
>three Lalas in Arabian concubine outfits sat at the feet of the bed
>two Lalas, one in a schoolgirl outfit and another a cheerleader, kissed around your throbbing cockhead
>two Lalas dressed as Bridget sucked and licked at your nuts
>you looked up to see he'd pulled the giant hand bed trick again
>a giant nude Lala watched you with a smile
>you looked back down to see hundreds of Lalas in various outfits around the giant hand
>all teasing and vying for your attention, some even engaging in sex with sex other for you to watch
>this entity could have broken his prison and killed everything he could grab
>now he was your husband/wife
>so maybe he'd convinced you this little slice of wherever this was wasn't half bad
>here you were his king
