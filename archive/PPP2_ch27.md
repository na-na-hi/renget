#### The C Programming Language
>*“C is a strongly typed, weakly checked, programming language.”* —Dennis Ritchie

*"This chapter is a brief overview of the C programming language and its standard library from the point of view of someone who knows C++. It lists the C++ features missing from C and gives examples of how a C programmer can cope without those. C/C++ incompatibilities are presented, and C/C++ interoperability is discussed. Examples of I/O, list manipulation, memory management, and string manipulation are included as illustration."*
