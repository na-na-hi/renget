####Leaving Your Leftovers All Over The Place####

*"No. No! I'm not like the rest of you people!"*

*Thump*

Hisa winced as she shifted the ice pack. Apparently the bathroom windows were reinforced, probably for dealing with, like, villain attacks or paparazzi or perverts or something, but unfortunately they dealt with Escape Technique #4 just as well. *Why did Shiketsu have bathroom windows anyway? Then again, it was a classroom now, so maybe it was installed afterwards?*

The entire morning was a complete blur. She'd been released from the nurses' near the end of lunch, and everything before that was, at best, disconnected moments, the vague awareness that she'd torpedoed her reputation with her future classmates, a set of contextless faces, and the iron-clad knowledge that the whole 1-F classroom existed as a sick joke. Well, that and Runt. 

Stumbling into the cafeteria, Hisa snagged one of the last pre-mades from a side table and went to sit down. 

*Squish.*

*"Gross, what'd I just-"*

That was a student. Just lying there, on the floor, and Hisa'd just planted her foot right in their face. A strangled apology and a quick retreat later, Hisa was looking (hopefully sufficiently) contrite. The other student continued to lie there, drenched in some sort of pink fluid, and a bootprint on her face. It was a girl, fairly small, and- *Wait, that's Suki.*

*"Have you ever wanted to join a... team? Itsssss a lot of fun."* 
That was probably an offer a friendship, right? What a disaster. 

"Sorry, honestly, didn't see ya there." 

Suki didn't respond. 
Hisa waited.
Suki continued to lie there. 
Hisa waited.
Suki maintained her state of complete repose. 

Slowly, tremblingly, Hisa took off her glasses and held them over Suki's mouth.

Being the Shiketsu Doctor was great. Large salary, little work, a great reputation with the students from the few times he'd had to help out, and most importantly - lots of free time to tinker. Little mysteries, devices were, and he did so love to take them apart and see what made them tock. Putting them back together, the better for it, was even better. 

So while he was frequently interrupted midway through poking something with his screwdriver, it was usually nothing major. Fix a boo-boo, sometimes splint a bone, and he was back to his hobbies. Hero students were tough little bastards, they didn't need his help that often. 

The door shattering inwards, splinters flying everywhere, told him that this case probably wouldn't be so easily resolved. 

"She-she's not breathing!" 

The blubbering teenager on a - was that a shark? - just proved it. Bother. 

--- 

"So she's alright? She's OK?" 

The shark girl, whatever her name was, was hovering over his shoulder and kept interruption the very delicate procedures of his quirk. "Point screwdriver at target" wasn't as simple as it looked. 

"Yes, yes, she should be waking up right about -now. Gave us all quite the fright, didn't you?" 

The doctor gave his patient a kindly smile. 
Said patient slowly opened her eyes, looked around the room, and opened her mouth. The other two leaned in closer to hear. 

"Yawp." 

"...Did she get brain damage from me ste-from not getting oxygen?" 

"No, no, she's completely fine. Just a little confused, that's all. Once she's in back in familiar surroundings, everything will come back to her. Though wait a minute, let me do just one final check." 

The Doctor stuck his screwdriver in his patient's face, who replied by hissing venemously and attempting to bite through metal. 

The shark girl whooped. "She's back to normal!"

It had been really tricky to get Suki back to class. She was getting more active as she got pulled along, hissing at random objects, being handled, or at random people in the halls. Similarly, she'd started to get bitey. It had gotten so bad that Hisa resorted to having a shark shove her along, even the trio got weird looks from people in the halls. 

But eventually, they made back to the restrooms, and after being stuck into her stall Suki started seeming a bit more herself. Well, not really, but she was back to hissing at people rather than biting them, so it was progress, right? 

Skycarver went to say something, then thought better of it. Rob looked vaguely guilty. Runt had poked her in the cheek, got bit for his trouble, and retreated back to his seat.
Hisa smiled. With time, everything will go back to normal, and nobody lost any limbs this time!

The door swung open.
Suki walked in, dressed in gym clothes. 

The two Sukis stared at each other. Nobody spoke for what seemed like ages. 

Then, suddenly, the Suki in her normal apparel darted up. With a sprint and a mighty leap, she leapt for freedom. 

The window did not yield. The classroom claimed another victim.

Outside, a watcher fell from her tree.
