Finding a God by /bara/hmoma writefren

>Like many twentysomethings, you were currently undergoing an identity crisis
>Unsure of your place in the world, you decided to go and "find yourself"
>And so you decided to travel.
>A crash course in Chinese and Mandarin allowed you to set up a backpacking tour of China
>You had been in the country for a month, and while it was beautiful, and the food was amazing. You were kind of lonely
>Outside of the tourist-y areas the locals weren't interested in dealing with a clueless looking foreigner
>You had a decent enough fluency to keep scammers and scumbags away, but there was an ache for some kinship
>Shaking off the gloom. You thought about today's itinerary.
>Supposedly there was an old Qing dynasty shrine right outside the village you were staying in, you wanted to check it out before you got back on the road.
>After a short chat and some haggling, a kind older woman running a vegetable stall pointed you in the direction of the shrine (after convincing you to buy a particularly nice looking head of lettuce)
>Now equipped with some very nice looking lettuce, you found an old path among the bamboo, just as described, you pushed forward.
>Nestled in a clearing stood a shrine, faded and weathered with age.
>There were little dolls surrounding it, all rabbit shaped. Weird.
>It seemed like nobody had been here in a while, there was dust all over everything
>hmm... it felt wrong to just leave it like this.
>Shrugging off your pack, you gave everything a quick little brushing off. Much better!
>At the heart of the shrine was an empty space, maybe that lettuce would look cute surrounded by all the rabbit paraphernalia?
>Plus you wouldn't have to lug it around if you used it as a respectful offering right?
>You plopped it down sitting it neatly in the middle
>You then placed your palms together and bowed, praying for a safe trip (and maybe a little romance...)
>As soon as the idea of a lover entered your head, the lettuce proceeded to explode
>The last thing you remembered was a flash of light and the leafy vegetable in front of you violently exploding
>The ringing in your head faded as a muffled voice shouted something
>There was a something touching you, it felt like a teddy bear, soft and warm...
>Forcing your eyes open, you caught a blurry shape over you, as white as fresh snow
>As the pain faded and your lungs remembered how to breathe, your eyes and ears sharpened back up
>"Oh thank the Jade emperor! You're Alive!"
>You dared to try opening your eyes
>Still stunned, your eyes and hands roamed over yourself, gently pressing and checking for injuries, you seemed ok but you might have broken something.
>"It's alright! I already performed a blessing, you should be fine"
>A blessing?
>You turned to the voice, wanting to ask what the hell happened
>You never managed to form a complete sentence when you met the ruby red eyes of your savior
>It was...
>A rabbit?
>Standing over you with a worried look on its face (snout?) was what appeared to be some kind of rabbit-man
>He was saying something, but your brain short circuited as you tried to process what happened
>Maybe this was a hallucination?
>Double taking and blinking a bunch didn't seem to make this rabbit-man go away though
>You looked over his form, a fluffy humanoid body covered in snow white fur, lithe and...very naked
>There were red markings running along his body, from his eyes down over his flat tummy, and along some absolutely sinful legs.
>His large rabbit ears drooped as he realized you weren't listening, he bent over and extended a hand (paw?) to you
>Running on autopilot, you gripped a very soft paw
>You kind of expected to just phase through, there was no way this guy was real after all, it was probably just your brain self-destructing right?
>But the rabbit pulled you up with surprising ease anyway
>"Sorry about that mortal, it's been a while since I've been summoned and I'm a little out of practice"
>You asked what exactly he meant
>The rabbit raised a brow at you "You made the offering right? Prayed to the shrine?"
>You nodded, looking at the shrine, now covered in a confetti of still-smoking lettuce
>The rabbit then smirked "well, your prayers have been answered!"
>"I, the great Tu'er Shen, Leveret god, have made a decision!"
>With a wave of his hand, the debris on the shrine was carried away by a gust of wind.
>He stepped with confidence onto the offering table of the shrine
>"You, mortal, prayed for a safe journey and a dashing male lover!"
>Woah wait you didn't specify male or dashi-
>"With your bountiful offering, I had no choice but to accept"
>This was surreal
>"You and I shall become both travel companions and lovers!"
>...You tried to recall the emergency number for an ambulance, was it 110 or 120? You were clearly having some kind of concussion-induced psychotic break
>He continued as you pulled your phone out "Don't let my gentle form deceive you, I shall protect you valiantly"
>Damn, no bars...
>"And as a god of love..."
>You looked up to see him with his back facing you "Satisfaction will be guaranteed"
>His face had a sultry smirk plastered over it as his slender hand gripped at one of his butt cheeks, showing gently pulling at the meaty glute and flashing a perfect, pink hole at you
>Maybe getting your head checked was a little too hasty.
