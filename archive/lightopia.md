-> [00:00]<-

Hey guys! Zachary Planes here once again, with my little boy Zach Jr. Say hi Zach.

hello!

Welcome back to another livestream! Today me and Zach wanted to go out for some general fun and in trying to find something to do, we found out about this outdoor event called Lightopia.

The pictures on the website looked really promising so I got us both tickets and lo and behold, we've been greeted with this sight first of all.

it's so pretty...

Indeed it is little buddy, let's get a start on the walk now then.

![Lightopia RECORDING 00:05](https://files.catbox.moe/oo7h7w.jpg)
-> [00:05] <-

Take a look at that little buddy! How long do you reckon it must've taken for those flowers and roots to grow?

they don't grow silly dad, they make flowers and roots!

Who makes them?

the light people!

That's exactly right! See what I mean when I say he's a smart kid guys? How about we keep moving forward, see what else this place has to offer?

okay!

![Lightopia RECORDING 00:08](https://files.catbox.moe/1g62mo.jpg)
-> [00:08] <-

Oh look at that Zach, very pretty pandas aren't they?

verrry pretty. can I touch them?

No no, you read the rules when we got here. No touching, no going off the path and always make sure you have something to eat.

but daaaad, they look so pretty!

...You know what champ? If I look away and point the camera elsewhere, you won't get in trouble for anything that springs to mind.

thaanks dad! hehehehe, come here pandas...

![Lightopia RECORDING 00:11](https://files.catbox.moe/hjfhla.jpg)
-> [00:11] <-
Let's not stay around those pandas for too long, don't want to draw the ire of the people working here, alright?

okay dad...let's keep walking, i wanna see more lights.

Alright little buddy, let's keep our heads up. Is it just me or is there not a lot of workers around?

there's a lot of people around though.

There is but they're all visitors like us. Barely seen anyone who's supposed to work here aside from the guards who scanned our tickets and let us in.

where do you think they are?

Hmm...probably by the stands. Want to try and get something to eat?

yes please!

![Lightopia RECORDING 00:16](https://files.catbox.moe/zkovck.jpg)
-> [00:16] <-

Down this way Zach! We'll be able to get to the stands in no time.

slow down please...i can't keep up...

You doing alright there? Feeling a bit tired?

i guess...but i'm still good to go though...

If you say so little buddy. Just this way, we'll be able to get along further down here.

![Lightopia RECORDING 00:20](https://files.catbox.moe/bdaguw.jpg)
-> [00:20] <-

Ooo, come on Zach. Take a look at these trees, aren't they gorgeous being lit up by the lights like that.

but i didn't come here to look at trees, i came here to look at the lights.

I know but...there's a sense of beauty in seeing how the lights come off of the trees. 

what do you mean by that dad?

You know it's just...I just see the stuff that we're not meant to focus on as beautiful as the stuff we are meant to. You get what I mean buddy?

...kinda.

That's good enough for me.

![Lightopia RECORDING 00:25](https://files.catbox.moe/km5aoz.jpg)
-> [00:25] <-

woah...why are they shooting the water up?

Hard to tell from here but...they might be projecting something onto the water.

prowhating?

projecting! it'd be like how we watch TV but instead of the screen being made of the TV stuff, it's water.

oooo, that sounds really cool. the water doesn't look like it's coming down though...it's kinda just staying in the air.

It's how water vapours work I guess...

##HOHOHOOOO AND WELCOME TO THE LIGHTOPIA FESTIVAL 

santa! dad look, there's santa!

I see him too little buddy. You guys catching this? 

##I SEE EVERYONE HERE IS HAVING A GOOD TIME

yeah we are!

##ME AND THE ELVES WILL BE PLAYING MUSIC ALLL THE WAY UP UNTIL CHRISTMAS EVE

Christmas Eve huh? That's quite some time away isn't it little buddy?

##JUST REMEMBER BOYS AND GIRLS, GET YOURSELF SOME FOOD WHEN YOU LEAVE THE CONCERT

##NOBODY LIKES A PERSON ON THE NAUGHTY LIST

Weird...why would you be on the naughty list for being a bit stingy?

can we go and get the food?

Sure thing...Santa's starting to creep me out a bit with the way he's staring at us, let's get a move on.
![Lightopia RECORDING 00:32](https://files.catbox.moe/mldpoj.jpg)
-> [00:32] <-

Here we are, the Food Court! Want to head in and see what's there little buddy?

hmm, i don't know...can we check out the stands first?

Of course we can. They've got some smoked ham, hot sandwiches...doughtnuts.

doughnuts! let's get doughnuts.

Alright little buddy, doughnuts it is. Let me just move the camera down a bit aand...

Hi, could I get two sugar doughnuts please?

...Hello? Huh, I don't think anyone's here.

b-but i want doughnuts...

There should be another stand up ahead, and if there isn't we can walk back and check again.

okay...
![Lightopia RECORDING 00:36](https://files.catbox.moe/gl7ixn.jpg)
-> [00:36] <-

Say goodbye to the Food Court Zach!

bye bye doughnuts.

I know it sucks to not have food but I'm sure there'll be more food ahead. Just need to persist and make our way there.

if you say so...i think some of the people are looking at us...

What people? Everyone I see is just walking ahead of us.

no, i mean the light thingies.

The light...oh Zach. That's just how the light people made them, they're designed to look at the people walking along here.

but...they're looking at us. not anyone else.

Relax little buddy, they're not going to hurt you. Come on, I'll show you.


![Lightopia RECORDING 00:40](https://files.catbox.moe/35s77l.jpg)
-> [00:40] <-

Here, take a look at this fox. He may be looking at us but he's not going to do anything to hurt us right?

it's a pretty fox. i wanna touch him.

Come on now, you already touched the pandas. You don't need to touch the fox as well do you?

b-but i want to!

Ah....fine, I'll look away again and if anything happens I won't be upset.

thanks dad.

Anytime buddy.

![Lightopia RECORDING 00:42](https://files.catbox.moe/bxi2kn.jpg)
-> [00:42] <- 

Hold on, lemme zoom into that thing in the distance...oh yeah, that's a ferris wheel over there! Do you see that Zach?

Zach? Come on you can't keep touching that fox forever-

...Where did you go?

![Lightopia RECORDING 00:44](https://files.catbox.moe/l3ivnq.jpg)
-> [00:44] <-
Hey buddy....When I said I won't be upset if anything happened when I looked away, that wasn't a call for you to head on off without me.

Buddy...?

Oh God where is he...Uh don't worry about this guys!

You know how Zach tends to be, always playing hide and seek at the house.

...Just never did it outside until now, Zach where are you?

![Lightopia RECORDING 00:49](https://files.catbox.moe/1cp2aq.jpg)
-> [00:49] <-

Sir! Sir could you please help me?

Look I don't have much time to explain b-but I think my son has gone missing.

He's wearing a bright blue coat and he's wearing this black beanie, cutest kid you could ever see.

Look I know you're busy here with this ferris wheel but if you could just please help me out here.

...**N̶̬̋̍o̴͈̊**...

Excuse me? I-is it because you're busy at the ferris wheel?

Where has everyone else gone? Why has this place gotten empty?

Shit shit shit, I'm going to jump the fence and hide out in the dark. Maybe he won't see me...

![Lightopia RECORDING 00:59](https://files.catbox.moe/nqvn9y.jpg)
-> [00:59] <-

Got some time to breathe...what the hell was that thing?

Didn't get much of a chance to look behind me but when I was jumping that fence, I got a glimpse of that fucker.

He was just...light. Nothing but pure light running towards me on all fours.

No...not just light. He had a skeleton within it too. Pure black, like it was scorched.

Still had his tongue in there...and his eyes. Those eyes that stared right at me.

I don't want to think about that thing anymore...wait...this it the playground for the park.

Why has it been blocked away on a path no one goes to?

Probably just so that people don't hurt themselves in the dark...

...Or because they want to limit where people can hide.

Think I'll just keep walking.
![Lightopia RECORRRDINNG 01:07](https://files.catbox.moe/85ds6r.jpg)
-> [01:07] <-

Managed to break away from the path and back to being here, might've lost that thing.

Now to find Zach.

Just going to check my surroundings, see if I can see him...

...The fuck is that thing?

Let me zoom in on that, what is that by the house?

...**ṗ̶̟l̶̼̀ȩ̸̀a̶̞̒s̴͝ͅe̸̺͒**...**ṗ̵̬l̷̳̔e̴̛̹a̶̞͝a̶̧͐a̵̤͝s̷͙̉ẻ̴̟**...

What in the fuck are these things? They plastered all along this hill side, what are they supposed to be?

Going to take a closer look guys...if anyone is even still watching this.

Bit hard to see into them but...I think something is wriggling inside of there.

It's a flat looking thing but...it seems alive.

It's like a fetus almost...just waiting to be birthed.

I don't know what's going on anymore.

I'm lost here, I can't see anyone else.

I'm alone.

Just need to sit here for a moment, catch my breath.
