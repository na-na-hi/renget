>IS GAME BAD??
No, but most of the game’s ‘investors’ are starting to come back so it is harder to find old product for below MSRP but for the most part prices keep tanking post release. If you’re not in a hurry you can also stick to buying History Packs (if you don’t care about card border) and the absolute best time to buy most single cards is about two weeks to a month after release since that is the maximum market saturation for box openings. Starting with Uprising there will no longer be 1st Edition or Unlimited so if you really want to open boxes for those sweet Cold Foils by all means go for it, but you don't need 1st Edition or Cold Foils unless you want to show off and you don't need Legendary or Fabled cards unless you're wanting to play in high-level tournaments and even then you only need 1 copy of those highest rarity cards.

>WHERE DO I START?
The best way to start the game is a Blitz Deck. Every hero starting with Prism and below in the QRD has an official deck and here is a helpful Google Doc that has decklists that you can build with bulk: [ https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-CgmIJGwjzJV16L4SjGFeuSM0wX_ngOD/view ] The price for an official Blitz Deck should be in the range of $10-$15 USD+tax after shipping, anything more and you should probably take your business elsewhere. Once you have the cards, the links in the How To Play section will cover the rest.
If you prefer to try a free simulator instead, your choices are Talishar [ https://talishar.net/ ], Felt Table [ https://www.felttable.com/fab ], or this Tabletop Simulator Mod. [ https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2191845555 ] (Obviously the latter requires you to purchase Tabletop Simulator on Steam but it goes on sale quite often and there are TONS of other mods you can get.)

>HERO QRD (Oldest to Newest) ! = New Hero # = Blitz only ^ = CC only
>Ira #
Death by a thousand cuts, loves to play reactions
>Rhinar
Unga big damage, a bit random but there are now enough cards to make him pretty consistent 
>Bravo
Loves to stall then bounces back with giant attacks that are hard to block
>Katsu
High IQ combo plays, sequencing makes or breaks him but the new Crouching Tiger build is gas
>Dorinthea
I SWING WEPON
>Dash
All gas or all brakes, no in-between but a good pick in any meta
>Azalea
Taxes: the hero, hard to sequence like Katsu and maybe one day she’ll be good
>Viserai (banned in Blitz)
Hybrid Arcane/Physical damage, very combo-oriented but easier than Katsu and Azalea.
>Kano
Arcane glass cannon, can OTK opponents on their turn if they’re not careful and don’t pack enough Arcane Barrier/Spellvoid or have enough cards left in hand to pitch. Oasis Respite is another card he hates.
>Kayo #
Even more random than Rhinar, play if you love RNG deciding how good your hero is
>Data Doll #
Self-mill with a starting hand of 3 instead of 4, she’s almost there in terms of support but still falls short 
>Kavdaen #
Exactly one Merchant equipment exists but this hero is still bad and can only use Generics, including weapons
>Benji #
Balanced Ira, 17 life kind of doesn’t matter anymore but there’s also not enough ways to get around heavy armor heroes
>Kassai #
Like Dorinthea but goes wide like the Ninjas, lots of card draw as well with Cash In and is one of the easiest/budget-friendly heroes to play and actually get results with
>Shiyana #
Shapeshifter that can use any specialization cards of other heroes and copies the opposing hero + abilities. Literally gets stronger and has new builds every set
>Prism # (banned in CC)
Big but fragile attacks (Phantasm) or full-on control with lots of card draw and fog effects (Auras/Spectra)
>Boltyn
Doesn’t rely on weapons as much as the other warriors, still has explosive turns like other warriors
>Levia
Unga that uses the graveyard as a resource but can self-damage if not careful
>Chane # (banned in CC)
Hybrid Arcane/Physical that can go very wide or tall and uses Exile as a second hand but self-damages if they don’t sequence correctly.
>Lexi
Lightning will look to go wide, Ice will look to go tall. Lots of fun interactions and is better than Azalea if you want to go for a Ranger pick
>Oldhim
An absolute unit. Tanks like a boss then turns around to deal BIG SOVIET DAMAGE and messes up whatever the opponent thought their next turn would look like
>Briar
LESS THAN 2 MONTHS AWAY FROM A CC BAN (Dec ‘22). Abuse Channel Mount Heroic for go again attacks big enough to make guardian feel smol.
>Valda #
The general game plan is Seismic Stir into any Crush attack backed by Tear Asunder or Pummel. Then you get to pile on Surges if your opponent is greedy and likes to draw cards (Prism, Ninja, Briar, etc)
>Iyslander
Ice Wizard who is a lot more defensive than Kano and will look to play various Ice cards to strip cards from hand, tax her opponent’s resources, and set up for the kill turn. You will be mostly playing on your turn, save for that arsenal card
>Bravo, Star of the Show ^ (BANNED)
How come mom lets you have 3 elements??? lol hit Living Legend (LL) 4 months after being printed, if you have any of his cards they’re still worth keeping when that format becomes a thing as he will still be able to use any Elemental cards printed going forward
>Genis
Merchant is still bad.
>Dorinthea, Quicksilver Prodigy #
Dorinthea with a worse weapon and ability. Don’t bother with Classic Battles unless you find it for under $40 and even then the only card you want other than the Mentor is Glistening Steelblade which makes up $30 of that price.
>Dromai
A more balanced Prism. Basic gameplan is: pitch Reds to make Ash > convert Ash into Dragon Allies using certain attacks or Invocations (new card type!) > keep swinging with Dragons and hope they can’t pop your Phantasm children. She wants a critical mass of red cards and Flamescale Furnace sadly is a must unless you don’t want to play the Legendary dragons.
>Fai 
Literally RDW: the hero. Send 15-20 damage a turn, don’t block unless you expect a discard effect, and most other heroes will not be able to keep up.
>Emperor ! #
Yes the emperor of Volcor is named.. Emperor. Seems crazy being a Royal Draconic Warrior Wizard and having access to so many cards but the reds-only restriction makes the CnC tutor not that great and your damage output pales in comparison to other Warriors and Wizards.
>Yoji ! #
UPF/PVE hero, do not bother unless you’re looking forward to DnD with a deck.
>Arakni !
New class on the block. Basic gameplan is to Fateseal your opponent and/or mill them with your on-hits. Play mind games with leaving bad cards on top to bait a Sink Below/Providence/Kano activation/card draw. Probably one of the hardest heroes to play well since you need to know all of your opponents cards and when they want to play what to make sure you’re not just stacking their deck. Don’t be afraid to put Wounded Bull or Fyendal’s Fighting Spirit in because you are not a Ninja; be prepared to block.

>WHAT CARDS SHOULD I PICK UP?
Remember that a CC playset is 3 cards, a Blitz playset is 2, and you only need 1 copy of an Equipment card. Even if you don't plan on playing CC picking up 3 copies of a non-Equipment card is still a good idea.
