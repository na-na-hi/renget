>long pink hair, black and red school uniform, a lot of piercings in her ears
>oh god, its one of those delinquent your chinese cartoons warned you about
>''hey man, watch it'' she says, in a deep voice
>you utter a half assed apology and exit the store
>the cold air of the night passes through your cheap suit, you breath in your hands in an attempt to warn them as you make your way to the parking lot
>there, squatting in the ground like some kind of wannabe russians, there are two girls
>red and white hair and a darker red one? you are not sure, but their uniforms and piercings just confirm what you suspect
>these two are delinquents, like the one inside the store
>you start walking up faster, hoping they dont notice you.
>let people call you a cuck or a beta male or whatever, you bet your ass one of them has a shank
>as you walk trough the streets, you start to feel anxious
>like somethings... wrong..
>you do a quick look over your shoulder and you have to summon your inner willpower to not squeak
>they are following you, those three girls
>you panic, and do a sharp turn into an alley
>brilliant idea! except somehow this one is a dead end, how strange
>as you look around any way to pass over the brick wall, you hear a soft voice
>''oi... you anon?'''' you turn around and sure enough, the three girls are there
>the horned one, walks to you
>''i asked you if you are anon''
>''what if i am?'' you squeak out, sadly you dont feel very corageous
>the girls share a look among themselves and start approaching you
>you back away, frozen in terror, triying to remember one of your old man's teachings before he left with his new taiwanese wife
>''ah shit, it seems today that all you see Is violence in movies and sex on TV''
>''Dammit dad'' you think, he was always too hungover on those good old-fashioned values on which we used to rely.
>The girls are closing in, you close your eyes and raise your hands
>''This is yours isnt it?'' says a squeaky voice
>You peak one eye, fully expecting them to punch you in the face, but instead you see the smaller girl holding a wallet
>your wallet
>''you left it in the counter, the guy there asked me to give it back to you'' the pink haired girl says, before stepping closer and grabbing you by the chin
>''OH NO, THEY ARE GONNA MAKE ME PICK UP THE SOAP'' you think, ''I FELL FOR THE OLD TRICK OF THE DICK WALLET''
>''Jeez you are freezing'' the older girl says, before opening her packpack and putting her scarf around you
>the other girl,the horned one, takes your hand
>''where do you live mister? we'll walk you there''
>''Yeah!'' says the smaller one, taking your other hand ''and well buy you a warm drink in the way there, since you seem to need it!''
>you sputter something about vtstreet before they start pulling you, the big one chastizing you for not bringing a sweater
