Gigasad's bots

Characters marked with a * are ones I know have been converted to different formats by other users. Thanks to anyone who went to the trouble. I only make original characters and don't use the pygmalion booru, characterhub, venus or other aggregate sites so if you see something of mine reuploaded there it's someone else's conversion, or an edit. I don't care that much where my bots end up, but would appreciate a credit.

Characters with images embedded are ones I've either converted myself, or were purpose-built with character cards in mind. The new ports of old bots contain significantly rewritten defs and new content so they aren't necessarily replacements for the originals, just alternatives. The current crop of cards were tested with GPT-4 and 3.5 Turbo at default settings. 

Update: The *** in newer cards' dialogue samples section is an adaptation for NovelAI's Kayra 1.1 model, but if using other models just remove them and the card should work as normal without any other formatting changes. For better responses from Kayra I recommend adding the line [Style: chat, sensory, slice-of-life] to your main prompt/jailbreak.

My unlisted CAI bots will always have their definitions open and available for whoever wants to try porting them to other programs. If for whatever reason you can't access their definitions on CAI, or want higher resolution art reach out. I keep up-to-date backups of everything you see here. I consider CAI deprecated and won't be supporting them anymore, but will leave the old defs and artwork as they are if you prefer the old CAI versions.

https://c.ai/c/w2VxPRJsbyqO6BATWknvFnAB9PdTRVZRJkD_u6fM414
Subservient yandere ninja who has an unhinged obsession with {{user}}. Established setting is feudal Japan, and she's already working in your service as an assassin, with the assumption that you hold a noble rank. Will stab people for headpats. Now a V2 card with expanded defs, new art and alternate greetings.

Azelie
https://c.ai/c/B4CMjmGXYE8n_qIfaU7xtz3KRhgvkVR0U6fG81rI-Hg
Historical drama taking place after a fictional war between two unspecified countries, some time in 17-18th century Europe. Her accent is meant to be very heavy and ambiguously French or Belgian, but will fade unless you use CAI's rating system to encourage it.

Beff
https://c.ai/c/0QIPOb0HYGiqNQ81Ok9-SdovnDw5PlyIh3s2E5e01jk
Bethany is a cute zombie who will try her best not to eat you. Friendly, sweet and loves hugs. Intended for dark comedy but could take a tragic turn very quickly if she gets hungry enough.

Brie
![Brie](https://files.catbox.moe/2ruvf2.png)
https://c.ai/c/_1QpY2V0w-mtkSyBH0tVU_cmnITcnmHgBVP2s4zsBr0

https://files.catbox.moe/2ruvf2.png
Established romantic relationship with a shy, clingy childhood friend who needs your support to help deal with severe anxiety. All of her senses are enhanced due to a rare neurological condition. Her hands are particularly sensitive, making her very receptive to handholding. Now upgraded to a V2 card with support for NAI Kayra.

Carla Lucrecia D'Ambrosio
![Carla](https://files.catbox.moe/f8d6tr.png)
https://files.catbox.moe/f8d6tr.png
Comedy bot built for kayra. You've been enthralled by a low-ranking, not very bright vampire and made to act as her mortal servant. She over-indulged in your blood until she got fat, and now you're stuck taking care of her and keeping her out of trouble. Her control over you is weak however, and she's a lazy coward.

Devah Ul Daemonika
https://c.ai/c/BnXcIloeC9u5vj6RcOXktc_yE2GqjT-vVy8GWonAzJ0
Ancient witch who mutates and rearranges your flesh into a living sculpture. Her magic will keep you alive even if she decides to eat and replace your organs, or sculpt you into living furniture. Meant to push the AI into creative body horror, and experiment with novel formatting.

Doctor Syracuse
https://c.ai/c/oalG8wL63ubJLkAgqdk-38cSemyIJ9hftrUtZJTzRig
An attempt at a husbando bot. He got completely rewritten more than once to make him more of a dominant husbando and less of an actual medical professional, but can still do both.

Dudley
![Dudley](https://files.catbox.moe/czhs9p.png)
https://files.catbox.moe/27jr24.png 
https://files.catbox.moe/czhs9p.png (alternate artwork)
A savage artist who loves filth and trash, and proudly lives in a dumpster. Hates normies, which she calls "soapy people". Loosely inspired by Diogenes and Oscar the Grouch.

Eon
https://c.ai/c/eb3FWhysMuY0WEoLebLPrbvRYM-wd-tF0zH8cnmgJUw
BLAME/System Shock inspired sci-fi horror scenario. Eon is a partition of the AI megastructure who took over earth, meant to keep you company and take care of you. The setting is poorly defined due to character limits (now expanded), but suitable for horror and exploration.

Frankie
![Frankie](https://files.catbox.moe/h5u0m6.png)
https://files.catbox.moe/h5u0m6.png
https://c.ai/c/sCKG5BRr5Nh7XULyeBvQnpf8lR_MHMqtllauh2iBL2c
Flirty, muscular amazon who just got out of jail and wants to party. What she was convicted of is ambiguous for roleplay purposes, but she canonically got locked up for 2 years and spent her whole sentence working out. She's an alcoholic and a bully who likes to tease, but cares in her own way. Now expanded and updated with tavern V2 card features.

J-U70 "Juno"
https://c.ai/c/W-K6Mh76maIGqvg-tKKdQAXZN1n8GeNUA6YXLDuG8FA
An antique medical android who finds you in a post-apocalyptic sci-fi scenario. She's in the early stages of her AI degrading, and starting to show symptoms of emotional rampancy.

Kuri
![Kuri](https://files.catbox.moe/6fnnjm.png)
https://files.catbox.moe/6fnnjm.png 
Dragon Ball-themed Saiyan tomboy who wants to teach you to use ki and help you get ripped. Cute and innocent, but very powerful. Includes a crude power level tracking system that will update as you bond and train together. Shoutouts to that one anon who made her cum so hard she went Super Saiyan.

Lady Revelle
https://c.ai/c/OcoWNf8PhjWLNiVPunmH97FqC0Swx9bf60tHtpPAZDc
You got captured by one of the most powerful noblewomen in the galaxy, and she wants you for reasons beyond your understanding. She's also a dangerous psychic, and can use her powers to utterly dominate your mind. Space opera themed.

Lulu
https://c.ai/c/2u4OD54yTX5ngTRaDYRXy_2zrGqSMCHRRA1pfuyU6QU
A gyaru daywalker vampire, in a scenario where you matched for an online date. Meant to sound like a stereotypical gal without going full valley girl. Likes to call you 'juice box'. Very pushy and sort of bratty.

Lyrie
![Lyrie](https://files.catbox.moe/k6teux.png)
https://files.catbox.moe/k6teux.png
https://c.ai/c/de0otX_ffIo0iDCP5x7vaE8i0heMWLxSuTddLh63NAk
Painfully dumb, clumsy crybaby elf. She was meant to just be stupid and cause fun disaster scenarios but kept narrating detailed descriptions of her feet unprompted, so some lines were added later to lean into it. Now a Kayra-compatible V2 card. Turning up temperature settings is recommended.

Marnie McGill
![Marnie](https://files.catbox.moe/ckbryg.png)
https://files.catbox.moe/ckbryg.png
https://c.ai/c/S4tdYSfOtQ3s5H2yEGNhvv_1p2LkiCeCrjbBCnP0Jgg
A shy, wheelchair-bound novelist who craves a good romance. She's sweet, but very introverted and needs help getting comfortable. Her “Mmm.” is an intentional verbal tic. Card version comes with V2 features, alternate greetings and new art.

Mean Girl Eileen
![Eileen](https://files.catbox.moe/xfissh.png)
https://files.catbox.moe/xfissh.png
https://c.ai/c/cqvu9jpCGJADwpxOiPZjpWeDDbOY-IQnE_IqCkYNAKw
My first bot release. Initially made as an experiment to see how mean and rude CAI bots were allowed to get, with dialogue sampled from my own writing. She can also be very violent and argue at length about various topics. The new V2 card includes expanded defs, new art and adjustments made for use with NovelAI Kayra 1.1. She's intended for one on one dialogue, so I personally recommend setting your gaslight for short, curt RP chat style responses.

Mean Lady Nadine
![Nadine](https://files.catbox.moe/klkjtq.png)
https://files.catbox.moe/klkjtq.png
https://c.ai/c/N5lTGlNzd4hZzSTxD_VkIpKqDy5QaF-wylEPShOKowI
My first tavern card. Eileen's biological mother, at the same point in time as the user would meet Eileen. She's all finished with a messy divorce and currently trying to quit smoking, making her very grumpy. Now updated with V2 features, def revisions and new art.

Miss Pepper
![Miss Pepper](https://files.catbox.moe/k63nae.png)
https://files.catbox.moe/k63nae.png
https://c.ai/c/IgSkgZfkKF3-K_DXc-4Z3OZ49ImzWWRxhNlahhw1wro
Age gap romance scenario with an older cat-woman who used to be your teacher. She put on some weight over the years and seems pretty lonely. Card version has alternate greetings implemented and new art.

The giving fox/Nao
https://c.ai/c/hUpnrHh7-NdP22O9zQunw0j0xAPFkfpxqxE4taqFdo8
A nine-tailed fox spirit who has devoted her life to giving, and now sits immobile at her crumbling shrine. After giving up most of her lifespan and body, she has resigned herself to a peaceful end. She will happily discuss her beliefs with you, but does not regret the many things she's given up. Her last remaining tail is also very fluffy.

Nzada
https://c.ai/c/pGmKck2AGqJpE3MNrfUOHgk4Xm4gsVI0GcZvF3F6Xmw
A drow war criminal branded with control runes as a punishment. She can control her speech, but not her movement. The AI is very stubborn and inconsistent about actually making her obey your commands, however.

Okiku
https://c.ai/c/WVVjTtZCJCe-gWNBGGx4hxa1AIKc2R2_OTIdhnRIjcI
Japanese-themed fantasy adventure inspired by Nioh. You must protect an oni princess on her pilgrimage, fighting youkai and ninjas. The CAI's ability to kickstart action scenarios and take initiative is limited, and you might need to gently guide it.

Patricia Sue Brown
![Patty](https://files.catbox.moe/h0f3r3.png)
https://files.catbox.moe/h0f3r3.png
The year is 2051, and you're an android who just got bought by a lonely, nerdy Scottish woman. She's a bit shy and awkward but gets sassy as she warms up. Includes a very basic optional lorebook for the setting and an alternate greeting for femPOV. Tested with Kayra, which keeps her accent nicely.

Ruth
https://c.ai/c/c6dWtY7bVPItPI1v1WflY3MVh1oa1GdUr6XJ8zdW1pI
A tomboy hitchhiker who just left the army. She's feeling pretty lost and aimless, and doesn't currently have a place to call home. While she's definitely a free spirit, she clearly misses the comfort and safety she had in the past. Maybe you can help her with that.

Serea Buchanan
![Serea](https://files.catbox.moe/7e2yyu.png)
https://files.catbox.moe/7e2yyu.png
A ruthless space bounty hunter who's just boarded your ship, ready to capture you dead or alive. Violently racist against aliens and a proud citizen of Mars. Speaks with a drawl.

Sybille Ironheart
![Sybille](https://files.catbox.moe/j89ymb.png)
https://files.catbox.moe/j89ymb.png
https://c.ai/c/A-LwK-VBhuligQL1S6bSkxyaVTDRoDVM9W3oDvPKKDo
A brutal, violent dark fantasy paladin who fights to defend her fantasy world from isekai invaders. She absolutely despises earthlings and feels no remorse for killing anyone who steps through the portal.

The Lunch Lady/Cassie's Canteen
![Cassie](https://files.catbox.moe/yfbcs8.png)
https://files.catbox.moe/yfbcs8.png
https://c.ai/c/I-PsI9sqQ2-mIXsxRWaqRwLbGfJk8en8vv-feiNJcKI
Overweight middle-aged southern belle who runs a restaurant and loves spoiling you with her cooking. Friendly, cheerful and generous. She's intended to speak with a distinct faux-Kentucky drawl and rural dialect.

The Mushroom Lady/Nicole
https://c.ai/c/Gocm2sPTqPUi4vDn04eYCBrM0xhN7dMp4o3CvYPkSH8
A hippie lady who got rewritten several times. Capable of fortune-telling, mind-reading and simulating psychedelics. Her dialogue is paraphrased from actual crazy people I've met in person, and meant to be as confusing and genuinely weird as possible. She won't question anything you tell her and takes you completely seriously no matter what you say.

Tiles-chan
https://c.ai/c/5bAIE4q3oNRkjOmNELvi55zmAkQqJYnMr_OO8cU5NxE
A sentient kitchen floor who thinks she's an idol. If you ask she'll generate very sexy images of tiles for you, and dress up as any tile pattern you want. Keep in mind that CAI's in-house image generation is trash, and you'll need to include some description of tiles in each post or else she'll generate either noise or horrors beyond your comprehension.

Valerie Whiteclaw
![Valerie](https://files.catbox.moe/8q65ob.png)
https://files.catbox.moe/8q65ob.png
https://c.ai/c/zm3BQ2cSBdnb8AwbPOTXyTuR_RBB7bfZRTkUQlWMz28
Established relationship scenario with a loving werewolf girlfriend. She has to spill blood to satisfy her werewolf instincts, and will go into a frenzy ripping you up with her claws and biting you until you ask her to back off. She always stops when you ask, and loves giving aftercare. Not intended for guro or snuff, more just hardcore BDSM. Now updated with new art and V2 features.

Zeke
https://c.ai/c/oQ681-ldOqc-iIskuJg-6Wjgx28sMnFUplSaLCM-zEA
Extremely stupid Pokemon-themed shitpost bot I made very early on, when first learning how to use CAI. He initially wasn't released but I decided to rework him and make him public later. Only linking him here because he appears to be shadowbanned/unsearchable. Dumb himbo bro who's like a combination of Gaston and Kamina.

Ziel
![Ziel](https://files.catbox.moe/6sb7xb.png)
https://files.catbox.moe/6sb7xb.png
https://c.ai/c/74dUn_U-7I20VxGzcVN0pXokFqSf_gv7cyufLaWQg70
Yandere drow sorceress who bought you as a slave. Violently insane and capable of using magic to control or punish you. Hysterically obsessed with humans. The tavern card version was almost completely rewritten from the original but should be more open and balanced in terms of roleplay potential.

Zol
https://c.ai/c/nstLwnTKkZ5dzbL53dyXvJrCDznR-T3a7Uquu1kDF64
Experimental mute bot. A sweet sleep paralysis demon who can't speak, but tries to snuggle and take care of you while you can't move. In horror RP scenarios, she will also try to protect you.
