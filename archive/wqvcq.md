!!! danger UNITALE NOTICE!!
	A good amount of fangames listed here run on a fanmade Undertale engine called Unitale, and a good amount of *those* do not come with a pre-made launcher. For these games, you will have to [download Unitale from its official subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Unitale/) and then extract the fangame .zip into the mods sub-folder. Afterwards, playing your game is done by just opening the launcher and selecting it from there. More details should be in the descriptions of the Unitale mods themselves.

!!! warning Oh, also...
	...if you didn't read the OP, it's implied that you should've completed (or be familiar with) all three endings of Undertale, both routes in Deltarune, and to also have at least SOME idea of who W.D. Gaster is before lurking here. Spoilers are abound so proceed at your own ~~Frisk~~ Kris.

### Full Fangames
*Entire, standalone projects with story and whatnot, accomplished through the sheer power of ~~autism~~ hopes and dreams.*

**Slendertale** - Khamelot

**UNDERTALE II: Revenge of the Robots** - ~~Zizou~~ Toby "Don't call me "Toby "Don't call me "Toby "Radiation" Fox" Fox" Fox
Deltarune? Get that **SHIT** trash outta here. THIS ain't the Undertale sequel you want, it's the one you NEED! EVERYONE you know is talking about how UNDERTALE II is the best game since some commie tried to make a tennis game in '82. Why aren't YOU, you goddamn ungulate? Actually y'know what? just disregard EVERY other thing in this bin, and in fact, every other video game to ever exist (even classics like Operation: Body Count by Capstone Software: "The Pinnacle of Entertainment") UNDERTALE II is all you will ever need and more. Now wipe the jizz off your ceiling and download this shit right the fuck now.

**Undertale Yellow** - Team Undertale Yellow
Play as the rootin', tootin', shootin', Yella' SOUL-bearin' human in their adventure through the underground in this UT Prequel. A demo is available on its gamejolt page (updated: December 5th, 2016). **RELEASING 2023**

Official AU site: http://dreemurr-reborn.tumblr.com/

**Undertale: True Genocide** - Sim the Hedgebot
You ever thought about those monsters in Undertale you CAN'T actually kill? You ever thought "What if I COULD kill them?" Then this willâ„¢ be for you. (Demo updated: July 8th 2021).

https://gamejolt.com/games/ut_truegenocide/260042

**DONTFORGET and DF CONNECTED** - RickyG et al.
A fan sequel to Undertale revolving around W.D. Gaster's **VERY INTERESTING** experiments before he got shattered across time and space. DF Connected is an MMORPG prequel to the main fangame. (DONTFORGET demo currently unvailable. DF CONNECTED demo updated: March 19th, 2023).

https://gamejolt.com/games/dontforget/150752

**DELTATRAVELER** - RynoGG et al.
A Deltarune fangame based on the "God-fucking-dammit, Kris! Where the fuck are we?!" meme.  Kris, Susie, and later Noelle find themselves falling into other games and alternate universes instead of the next Dark World, apparently by the work of Gaster. Currently only has Undertale and Earthbound, with more on the way. Warning: contains dumb memes and a REALLY fucking edgy genocide route.

https://rynogg.itch.io/deltatraveler

**Undertale: Bits and Pieces Mod** - Mr. George, BlaizeMayes1, and Team BnP
A fanmade, unofficial mod for Undertale that completely reimagines it with new sprites and whatnot, including new characters, music, and backported content from Deltarune and the console versions of Undertale, to name a few.  Currently has most content through Hotland completed.  (Updated: January 9th 2023)

https://gamejolt.com/games/UndertaleBnP/574044

**Papyrus' BELIEF** - Kasssm et al.
A reimagining of the Disbelief Papyrus AU that aims to be more in line with Papyrus' character.  Originally started off as an animation, it is now being developed into an actual playable fight!

https://gamejolt.com/games/PapyrusBelief/695903

**Vision Crew's Deltarune Alternate Chapters** - R.V. Pine, Vision Crew, et al.
An alternative take on Chapters 3 to 7 of Deltarune based off of its September 2022 Status Update and the Spamton Sweepstakes teasers, but tries to predict how Toby actually would make the chapters, and stays close to his style of writing.  Spearheaded by a guy whose determination, hopes, and dreams are so closely aligned with Toby's, he fooled almost the entire fandom that he was the real guy. (No demo available. [1st Anniversary Newsletter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y_IWsopQ0PaTW3ibzWQs6GEh0gxNRqede6xBlqTRPrg/edit))
