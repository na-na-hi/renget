Penny/Jacob Part 2


>>Flushed and sweaty, I leaned against the wall, dripping cum from my gaped arse, shoulders heaving as I regained my breath.

G-good. Now... Your end of the bargain. We explore the rest of this place and I get access to all your ancestors knowledge...

>>Swallowing heavily, I licked my dry lips and grabbed my wand, using it to once more clean myself and then, no longer dripping, I bent over to pull up my pants, giving you one last look at my arse and pussy, ignoring the twinge in my sore rear-end.

0

>I couldn't help but grin in satisfaction, as I saw your holes presented to me once again, before you put your clothes back on. I did the same with my breeches, the afterglow slowly leaving me, bust still leaving a residual haze from the gases residing deep into me.

Yeah, sure. My end of the...bargain?

>With my pants on, and my balls momentarily empty, the reality of the situation struck me; I've just accepted to continue exploring this bloody dungeon, fully knowing- no, even worse- not exactly knowing what could delve deep into its bowels. And the memory of that...thing moving inside the tanks was still vivid in my eyes. But it was too late to take my word back, and I sighed as I saw you smiling enthusiastically. After all, the promise of hidden knowledge didn't sound that bad either.

Yes. Let's go, Penny.

0

>>I led the way down that long tunnel, the gleam of my orb of light shining off those strange tanks. The air was growing cooler and then the floor started descenuin a gentle slope. Further and further down we went, wands in hand, until the tunnel ended abruptly into a large cavern that had a musty scent.

>>With a mental nudge my orb of light flew outwards as we stood at that precipice. The cavern was large, a pit, really, with a naturally domed ceiling. Recalling my light, I looked down, seeing a step onto a platform of wood that led to a set of stairs that descended into the inky blackness…

0

>The cavern felt even damper and colder than the tunnel, and I shivered under my school robes. Strangely enough, I didn't feel particularly scared for now, as descending into a creepy, dark dungeon was pretty much a normal end of the day for a Slytherin at Hogwarts.

Woah. That looks deep.

>I whispered, almost in your ear as I abruptly stopped behind your shoulders. The stairs seemed quite long and dark and creepy, but I didn't bother to ask, as I already knew the answer.

I know, there might be something down there, we need to investigate. Let's keep going.

>I sighed, as I slightly intensified the light provided by the Lumos charm flickering on my wand.

0

>>I nodded and nudged you with my elbow, trying to keep your spirits up.

Just think of all the degenerate, depraved things you can make me do. Should keep us both nice and relaxed as we get ready for exams - besides, it's normal for guys to think with their dicks.

>>That said, I smirked at you over my shoulder and took a step onto that wooden landing, relieved that it didn't break under my weight, though the wood did creak. Breathing out lowly, I started descending into the stairs into the pit.

0

>I frowned and almost let out a sharp retort, feeling slighted and undignified, but instead settled for grumbling to myself, as I reasoned you weren't completely wrong- my dick agreeing with that as well.

Yeah, sure, whatever Penny. Let's go.

>I added, in a not so hurt tone, before gulping, as my turn arrived to follow you into the pit. One after the other, we descended into the darkness.

0

>>I realized that I might have gone too far on that one and I stopped descending, actually stepping up a stair to meet you, where I leaned up on my tippy toes, placing a gentle kiss on Jacob's lips, smiling at him in apology before, without another word I continued my trek downwards.

>>The air soon went from cold to cold and misty, swirls of fog coiling around our legs.

0

>The brief kiss was a more than pleasant diversion to the gloomy descent, and after that I grinned like an idiot as we went through what seemed hundreds of stony steps. The redheaded know-it-all was definitely right, we do think with our dicks.

>Finally, the stairs were at an end, white fog rising from the hard ground, the moisture in the air sharpening the chill in it, as it penetrated under our robes and into our bones. The floor seemed wet as well.

So, where did we end up..

0

I'm not sure... Some sort of antechamber? It's too big to only be a lab. I imagine there's other tunnels leading to other places. Maybe labs, libraries, vaults... It's impossible to say without exploring... I do know one thing thought. This is the perfect environment for Devil's Snare, Inferi, and Dementors... Keep your wand lit...

>>I hummed to myself, glancing at you while also trying to keep an eye out for any threats.

I don't suppose you know what -other- research your ancestor was involved in? Maybe he had disciples - multiple research teams? That's what I'd do, at least.

>>I leaned down, taking a single knee, and rubbing a finger across the ground to collect some of that moisture before bringing it to my nose to smell it.

Okay, that's just water. I was worried it might be some sort of trap... But that means there's a body of water nearby, probably out there in the blackness where we can't see...

>>I thought of that massive tentacle and swallowed my nerves, throwing up more orbs of light, an even half-dozen of them, giving us more room to see…

0

>I nodded, keeping my wand bright and high in front of me, as I scanned the hazy surroundings.

As far as I know his research was focused on, well you know, breeding. He studied and experimented with charms, transfiguration, potions and even creatures to perfection his...tools. And we already had a taste of those.

>I shuddered. That taste did turn out to be quite good, but I did not dare to hope everything in there would be so easy.

I do not know anything about acolytes...but I supposed it would be wise to be prepared for anything.

>I raised my wand even higher as I followed your kneeling figure with my narrowed, blue eyes, before watching as you stood back up and lightened up the misty area with your shining orbs charm.

0

>>I nodded - just because I would want students and assistants if I had such a large lab, I suppose there were some who just went it alone - the architect of Azkaban, the Dark wizard Ekrizdis came to mind. The solitude and nature of his horrific experimentation driving him to paranoia and madness.

Okay. Let's move on. Cast Revelio every now and then and keep your eyes peeled.

>>And since I just suggested it, I raised my wand overhead and sent out a pulse of magic with a muttered incantation. I felt something splash against it and before I could lose its location in the darkness I sent one of my orbs off in that direction, the small ball of light leaving a trail like a comet as it went.

There's something over there. Not natural stone. Man-made and loaded down with magic…

0

>I moved closer to the artifact. It was big, the familiar shapes of the tanks and tubes we've seen in the upper level of the dungeon in its background.

Now, what would that be...

>The revaling charm shined a dimly gold around it, before disappearing and letting the bleak atmosphere fall back in the grotto.

>I waited for you to arrive, your lighting orbs following on your tail.

0

Maybe it's not a good...

>I stopped, thinking that looking like a coward wasn't the impression I'd like to give.

Sure, let's try that.

>I started walking around it, my eyes still looking at the tanks close by, frantically looking for leakages or openings with a certain concern.

>I found some vials on the ground, a hazy vapor, or fluid, floating in it, not dissimilar from the ones we encountered before, from a first look. I pocketed it, before raising my voice.

Found something there?

>I called out to Penny, frowning as I saw some cracks around one of the tubes.

0

>>I had wandered off while you examined the... whatever it was... on the other side of the chamber, I found another tunnel, this one coated in moss and slick with algae.

>>"Found something there?"

Tunnel!

>>I called back.

Gonna go check it out - be right back!

0

>I sighed, used to Penny's fits of adventurous spirit, and returned to my research. I approached the artifact finally, judging the tanks to be secure enough.

>Its stone, clearly imbibed with some sort of old magic, judging by the glowing runes, looked almost inviting to the touch, their light soft and white in the darkness of the grotto.

>I could make out the emblem of my family, some dust and detritus covering it.

Well, well, what do we have here.

>instinctively, I brushed it with my hand to clear it off, and immediately let out a sharp hiss of pain.

>a small spike emerged from it, puncturing the skin of my palm.

Bloody Merlin...

>I cursed, the wound shallow but strangely hot, the warmth pervading now my body.

>I swallowed and shook my head, as I felt...new feelings. Senses I didn't know one could possess. Suddenly the area didn't seem so dark, so big, so empty...because somehow, I suddenly realized it wasn't empty at all, and something was there with us.

0

>>I stepped through the opening into the other tunnel, walking down the corridor of slick stone. Thankfully this one was shorter than the one leading away from the ritual room and I soon found myself in a thin but long room lined with stone shelves full of glass bottles and phials containing strange things. Ingredients, I presumed, and I assumed I had found myself in his potions lab.

>>I walked in, reading tags and labels as I went: Eye of Newt, Salamander Scales, Ant-Legs and more. I didn't know if they were still good, depending on how long they had been down here, but at the back of the room I found a writing desk covered in ancient velum scrolls and a thick, dust-covered tome.

>>I grinned.

0

>While Penny was searching my ancestor's study, I was on my knees, panting, my newly discovered senses overwhelming me.

>My face was a mask of sweat, I cleared a sticky fringe of blonde hair from my forehead, breathing in the damp, cold air.

Penny...

>I whispered to myself, fully knowing something was directed towards her.

0

>>I picked up the book, glancing around and mentally nudging one of my lights towards my shoulder. The letters were penned in a sharp, scratchy way, as though the author was carving them into the page rather than writing them, and I grimaced.

Some sort of code or cypher...

>>I took my hat off and stuffed the book away into the space-expansion charm within, before donning it again and glancing around and though I knew I wanted to look through these detritus here, especially those ingredient shelves I figured I should get back to Jacob again.

>>I smiled at the thought of the guy - he was easy on the eyes, and braver, I think, than he thought he was - even if he was technically being bribed into this adventure…

0

>I stood in front of the artifact, my eyes cloudy and unnatural, my thoughts not mine anymore for the time being.

>I could sense where Penny was, not through my own senses, but it was crystal clear in my mind.

>I looked as she exited the small tunnel she entered before, books and jars in her hands, a bright smile on her face.

>I said nothing and just grinned, now looking over her, at the green, scaly creature just behind her, looming on the wall above the tunnel's entrance.

0

>>I was trying to balance my loot in my arms when I saw Jacob's wand lit up next to that thing from earlier and I yelled out.

Jacob! You'll never believe all this incredible stuff I found! And there's still more back there! Some sort of special potions lab!

>>I didn't seem to notice anything amiss…

0

>Penny didn't even have the time to gasp as the creature pounced at her.

>I didn't move as I heard the sound of the jars crashing on the ground, scrolls and parchments fluttering around in the air as the eldritch creature landed on her body, throwing her off balance.

0


>>I let out a loud OOPH as I felt something heavy impact my back, bearing me to the ground, landing hard on top of me, screeching and snarling and I grunted, struggling as I turned my head to look over my shoulder at my assailant. Bronzy green skin with purple markings and bulging golden eyes. Its forelegs were thick and muscled and had fins or wings or something on them.

>>I screamed and fought harder, trying to dig for my wand which was safe in its sheath but with my arms pinned there was little chance of reaching it.

JACOB HELP!

0

>My expression was neutral, my milky eyes fixed on you.

>Despite being meters away, I could feel you. I could smell the nice perfume of your coppery hair mixed with the salty scent of the sweat glazing over your body, your fear almost palpable.

>The beast put one of its forelimbs on Penny's back, pinning her on the cold ground, her lungs momentarily squeezed out of air as she wheezed. Its alien-looking, reptilesque head looked down on her, its look emotionless and monstruous, as its other forelimb started scratching at her clothes, the talons sharp enough to rip the fabric like a knife, but strangely careful in not cutting too heavily the pale, clammy skin underneath.

0

>>I whimpered, flinching with each tear into my garments, sobbing out each time I was nicked by the barest graze of its claws and then I heard wood clatter away and saw my wand slip from its holster and clatter away into the darkness.

NO! NOO Get the FUCK off!!

0

>My eyes narrowed, my body unmoving, as the beast finished ripping off whatever clothes remained on your lower body, only ragged pieces of fabric clinging around your torso and your lower legs.

>Small, red lines appeared where the skin was nicked, not deeply at all, but the slight pain only adding to Penny's fear as she screamed.

>My ears were unwillingly deaf to her cries for help, and I stared like a statue as the eldritch, scaly creature positioned herself better, the quadrupedal, glistening body looming over her in a mounting position, one of her forelegs keeping her pinned, the other lifting her hips higher, her weight akin to that of a doll compared to the brutish strength of the monster.

NonononononofuuuckfuckfuckFUCK - Accio Wand, Accio Wand! ACCIO WAND!

>>I felt my hips lifted, my body repositioned, and I remembered exactly what Jacob had said about this place...

>>"As far as I know his research was focused on, well you know, breeding. He studied and experimented with charms, transfiguration, potions and even creatures to perfection his...tools. And we already had a taste of those."

>>I tried to slam my thighs closed, but the creature hissed threateningly into my ear and I shivered in revulsion and fear as I spread my legs for whatever awful thing was incoming behind me..

0

>I looked at the creature, a blink of my eyes all I needed to set it in motion, our wills intertwined, our bloods shared.

>Penny remembered my words so vividly, especially with focus on the "breeding" part, that despite all the fear, revulsion and confusion of the moment, she couldn't help but feel also puzzled at the sensation oft he spongy, slimy tip of the creature's prodding her arsehole.

>Her recently abused sphincter winked instinctively, shutting close, as the grotesquely swollen, slime dripping head of the bestial scaly cock started prodding more insistently, sliding between her pale, trembling asscheeks.

0
>>I couldn't see just -what- was prodding around back there, but I was sure that it was going to be grotesque and massive judging by the size of the thing, and I wasn't sure if there was a 'preferable' place to put it. My ass was still probably 'broken in' and my pussy was sore from the Snakes and Jacob.

P-Please don't...

>>I whimpered, shivering as I felt its scales scratching against my back…

0

>The serpent taur creature took quite a while trying to find the right angle, the obscene size of his deformed, swollen member not helping in its goal

>I started to walk closer, my demeanor calm, almost absent minded, but the feelings emanating from Penny, her heat, her scents, clear as rain in my head, and to the beast.

>The only bright side to this, so to speak, was that the copious amount of slime covering its shaft was dripping freely over Penny's lower body, her buttocks glistening with it, some of the translucent slime having even made its way inside her winking anus as well, making it sticky but at least well lubed, as the bulbous, pale head frenetically tried to find its way in, the beast letting out a frustrated, reptilian hiss before finding its mark.

0

>>I felt something hit against my loose, not-so-puckered rear-end and my eyes closed in frustration. I let out a low whine and clenched my hands into fists as I watched Jacob approach, no fear in his mien - as if he weren't himself...

>>Oh no...

J-Jacob... Please help me... It's me - Penny... O-Our bargain... Do you remember our bargain?

0

>I looked at you almost curiously, my face could almost be mistaken as serene, if it wasn't for the milky, daunting eyes.

Penny..

>I repeated, throatily, with a strange voice.

>At a slight gesture of my head, the eldritch creature lifted Penny's torso, her head at the same height of my waist now, as she grunted and uselessly tried to squirm her way out of the black talons, its grotesque, stallion-sized swollen cock for now still, snugly sandwiched between her soft cheeks.

>I disrobed myself with slow, absent-minded movements, until my semi-erect human cock was in front of your pale, desperate face.

Bargain..

>I repetaed again, my voice almost a low, promising whisper.

0

>>I closed my eyes, letting out a few shallow breaths, but I nodded - the creature's cock lodged against my ass all the threat needed to keep me compliant.

I - I will. I'll do it... Just call this thing off...Please...

>>The monster hissed again and I flinched, but I leaned in all the same, grimacing when I smelt my own ass on Jacob's unwashed cock but then I swallowed nervously and parted my lips and I slurped his cock into my mouth. It was warm, and started flaccid, but soon I felt it start to harden to its full-size within my mouth, spongy head bumping against the back of my throat as I started bobbing my head on him, lips stretching taut around his shaft.

0

>It felt good. Penny's mouth was wet and warm, her noisy suction soon made me hard as humanly possible, my sensitive head feeling good as it rubbed against the smooth back of her throat.

>But it wasn't enough, not nearly so.

>I closed my eyes as the reptilian creature let out a hissing growl, the bulbuous oversized head of its slime covered cock popping inside Penny's sphincted with a wet sound.

0

>>My eyes popped open and I let out a scream, cock still lodged into my mouth, sending vibrations down your shaft. The creature's cock grew wider, and seemed to be made of concentric, layered plate-like ridges that widened, then ended, then widened over and over, slowly growing bigger and bigger as it sank deeper and deeper, like some demented sex toy. My eyes were twitching open and closed, irises rolling up, showing more and more of my whites. I let out sloppy-sounding grunts, spit burbling up and out of my mouth and down my chin as I was double-penetrated, the one in my ass feeling like I was being fisted by a suit of armor, and the one in my mouth doing its best to choke me out as I spluttered and coughed against him…

0

>Somehow the pleasure doubled, an incredible feeling washing over me as the ridged bestial cock worked its way in Penny's rectum. The friction of its bone plate-like ridges was aided by the copius amount of slime being continuously deposited in Penny's rear through its translucent skin secretions, while the bulbous, fleshy part of the shaft bulged and deformed her previously tight passage, the shape of the bestial phallus visible on the taut skin of her pale abdomen.

>I sighed deeply, a remarkable show of emotion -pleasure, to be exact- considering my current brainwashed status, Penny's saliva dribbling down my shaft against my balls, her nose, that a previous Jacob would have found cute, firmly pressed against my blonde pubes.

0

>>I beat weakly on Jacob's thighs, even as I was shoved forward, ass stuffed, throat bulging, eyes fading to blackness as I was suffused with pain and sexual dominance. My body tried to swallow deep lungful's of air, but with his cock deep inside my throat all I succeeded in doing was massaging his shaft and head with my esophagus.

0

>Only the sudden motion of the beast got Penny fully conscious again. The quadrupedal creature started humping her harshly, the massive ridged cock pumping mercilessly after the initial, almost kind penetration. Her stomach bulged, her ring let out wet, squelching sounds as her lithe body was rocked.

>Her mouth was gargling on my cock, saliva and precum splattering, Penny instinctively taking hasty breaths whenever she could, her screams and groans otherwise muffled from my cock.

>Staring at her as she gagged and trembled, I put my hand in the pocket of my opened, rolled robes, extracting one of the vials with the familiar fluid from the altar. Carefully, I took off the cork lid and dribbled the powerful, pheromone-filled content all over the length of my shaft she was forcefully gagging on.

0

>>Rocked back and forth by the ridged monstrosity gouging open my rectum, I wasn't aware enough to see what was happening, but then I tasted something (besides my own ass on Jacob's cock)... Something familiar... I managed to glance upwards in the split second the beast was almost out of my ass and saw that familiar fluid and I shuddered, then that beast shoved me forward painfully once more and I was made to slurp it in. That familiar heat burned through me once more, almost instantly, and I groaned in pleasure remembered, my ass clenching unconsciously on the creature's armored cock...

And then suddenly the pain started to recede as the drug took effect and though I was aware enough to be angry at what was happening... It was a fair trade off to escaping the brutal raping of my arse and mind-controlled betrayal of my partner.

>>A glint in my eye, I gave a powerful slurp as I was yanked back on the beast's cock, my cheeks going concave and my lips pulling back…

0

>I grunted at the noisy, strong slurping, the beast grunting in unison with me, its reptile hissing not being able to cover the sound of its ridged, bulbous member sliding back and forth Penny's ruined anal passage.

>Suddenly, almost out of nowhere, the beast stopped. Its massive member throbbed, a bulge going through its lower shaft, then another, then another.

>Squishy, gelatinous spheres were now being deposited in the depths of Penny's rear, the beast grunting every time one of them was released inside the girl, its forelimb keeping her still and unable to move, only to receive.

0

>>My eyes went wide ad though I didn't stop slurping on Jacob's cock, my shoulders were shaking and hunching and unhunching with each deposit... Was my ass really getting bred right now?

>>I tried to clench my arse, to do anything - hopefully push the... things out... but the beast's relentless fucking had sapped the strength from that entire area of my body and, in fact, I reckoned when the beast let me go I wouldn't be able to move at all…

0

>Finally the beast stopped, several gelatinous spheres of dubious nature deposited deep inside Penny's asshole. The beast started retreating its cock, its hissing lower now, each armored ridge of his cock making Penny yelp as it spread its sphincter when leaving it.

>As the beast was doing so, I retreated from Penny's mouth, a string of saliva and precum still connecting my cock to her plush lips. I pushed my hand in my pocket again, this time exctrating a slightly different phial. Its content was bright green and ominous, and it felt sour as I gulped it down without hesitation, somehow knowing exactly its nature and its function.

>Penny gulped in dismay as she saw my member starting to change...

0

>>The good thing about the beast's cock being so large... The things that it left inside of me were able to seep out, popping out with an embarrassing 'plllooooop' sound before they splatted on the floor, rolling around and jiggling but able to keep their shape... Four times that happened, but then I could feel more still lodged too deep to do much about at the moment... Besides... The mutating human cock had drawn my attention, the aphrodisiac I had been fed inspiring more curioucity than dread.

0

>I grunted as that delicate part of my body changed, enlarging obscenely, assuming a brutal shape, its length going as far as slightly exceeding the Creature's. It didn't have any bone plates, but a saries of ridges on its under shaft, and bumps on the top.

>The creature meekly hissed, as it reared, its glistening scaly forelimbs now turning Penny's body, presenting her to me in a situation ironically not dissimilar from the one experienced not long ago from the altar.

>As she was put on that position, gravity caused a couple of more gelatinous globes popping out of her gaped anus with a lewd sound, Penny now groaning, her green eyes glazed, before focusing on mine once again.

0

>>My skin was flushed and alternatively clammy and heated and I shakily reached down between my spread legs, pinching my vulva and spreading my labia, showing... no, Presenting my pussy, my tunnel held open and dripping with opaque grool...

>>I was absently aware of the creature, against which I leaned, even as it started licking the sweat from my cheek. Two more gelatinous orbs slipped from my ass…

0

>The creature's reptilian tongue was lapping avidly Penny's face, her sweat, the saliva around her lips, its tip going as fare as to explore her mouth, albeit shallowly for now.

>I grinned, my first show of true emotion since this ordea started, as Penny presented me her sopping cunt, almost admitting total submission. I could not be sure if this was entirely the pheromone's work, but I did not care.

>Once again, like not long ago, I pressed the monstrous, dark tip of my newfound member against her passage. Her swollen labia trembled, her fleshy sleeve already contracting in anticipation, her body unable to realize what was about to enter it, but wanting it nonetheless.

0

>>My eyes fluttered closed and I arched my back as I snogged the Creature, even while I rolled my hips forward, trying to tempt Jacob inside me. The Creature's tongue was dexterous and thick, almost cock-like, if a normal cock was prehensile, and it tasted of fish and something unidentifiable.

>>I barely opened my eyes, the green iris almost luminescent in the gloom of the antechamber, and they were staring directly at Jacob, awaiting his next move…

0

>I smiled, looking back into her green, warm eyes, before thrusting forward my hips.

>Somehow her sopping cunt managed to swallow my tip almost immediately, stretching and spasming like crazy around my first inches, the bumps after the engorged glans rubbing against the texture of her own inner walls, as they struggled to accept more of my lenght, despite the unnatural lubrification.

Penny...

>I groaned out of nowhere, as I fed her hungry vulva more and more of my obscene cock.

0

>>I grit my teeth and wrapped a leg around his waist, trying to keep him from pulling back as he struggled against the natural limits of my slender body, enhanced as they were by that cocktail of chemical lust, and instead I pulled him in until he hit the back of my gripping, tight fuck-sock, drawing a low, needy moan from my lips, despite the cock-like tentacle tongue of the Creature. There was an indentation of his cock in my flat, taut tummy and I reached out with a shaking hand, cupping his cheek even as I broke broke my kiss with the Beast and instead urged him towards me, kissing him as he drew close. Unlike on the stairs, it wasn't one of sheepish apology, but one needy and filled with unnatural lust, tongue driving into his mouth as I rolled my hips with him inside, massaging his cock with my stretched walls, the ridges on the underside of his eldritch phallus grinding while his alien head punched up against my cervix with a slick squelsh..

0

>I moaned into Penny's mouth, my tongue instinctively wrestling with hers, exchanging our fluids, as my tip, still very sensitive despite the colossal change in nature, prodded against the spongy texture of her cervix.

>The passion and absolute lust of the moment moved my hips, and with a final, forceful thrust, my head and a few inches of bumpy flesh speared through her soft cervix, lodging inside her awaiting uterus, the heat hitting my sensitive glans skin and making the entire monstrous shaft throb harshly.

Nnghhh...

>I was now completely hilted inside her, our sopping pubes pressing against each other, her perky teats pressed against my chest, all these sensations making me groan again in her wet, hungry mouth.

0

>>I was so full that it made it hard to continue my movements, like a rod of iron was within me holding me in place, but I was able to fight though the discomfort at the bruising abuse of my cervix, aided as I was by the aphrodisiac, to clench tight on him and twist my hips, once, twice, three times, my insides writhing around him in a way that shouldn't be possible, almost like a fist adding a twist to a handjob - only it was a maneuver performed with my cunt instead. Inside I could feel the fullness of my uterus and I wanted what I knew was on its way... A second helping of Jacob's cum right where it mattered...

>>Perhaps this place was changing me too?

0

>My body went rigid and my bestial cock pulsed, ridges and bumps swelling, as my monster-like testes tightened to finally release their massive, warm load.

G-GODS!

>The first spurt almost filled Penny's ready womb, the second made her tummy, the shape of my phallus already visible on it, swell slightly more.

>I kept groaning and releasing myself, her cunt trying her best to milk the inhumane cock, my tip firmly lodged past her cervix as it unloaded potent, creamy seed.

0

Uungghhh~~!!

>>I hunched up underneath Jacob, riding out the storm of his magically-enhanced ejaculation, even as I felt the deluge eventually start to seep through the seal made by my entrance around his impossible cock ridges, spurting out under pressure - a fountain of cum that sprayed at least three feet to splatter onto the wet cold ground.

0

>I gasped and panted over her, thick cum drooling out despite the seal made by my cock ridges, Penny's usually flat tummy now slightly bulding, as I finally felt the immense orgasm subsiding.

>I planted a final wet kiss on her parted, wheezing lips, and started to slowly slither my spent meat out, bumps and ridges making their presence felt inside her rippled sleeve as they left it.

>>Each bump and ridge that slipped out of my cum-lubed hole drew a grunt from my lips, my pussy rippling, and the sheer suction of Jacob voiding my pussy threatened to turn my insides to my outsides, but as the last of his member left my depths, I collapsed back against the creature, my chest heaving as my nipples finally started to lactate again, the lesser amount of aphrodisiac I had slurped off Jacob's cock slower in that regard than the massive amounts the snakes had pumped directly into my gullet.

>>Finally I lay there, fucked for the fourth? Fifth? time in perhaps an hour and a half... My pussy was bruised and leaking... and my ass was as well and I was seriously worried my body would break with any more as I looked up at Jacob...

>>My twitching fingers had been all I needed to call my wand to my hand, a skill I was getting strangely good at, considering all the times I had been disarmed recently (usually with the same end result as now) so as you leaned in to try and suckle my breasts I jabbed my wand at the fleshy underside of your chin, eyes like cut emeralds and blazing with anger.

Prove you're back to normal or only one of us is leaving this place alive...

>>My tone was sharp, but at the same time flat, as though I had retreated into my fight or flight instinct, and since I could barely move my legs and couldn't 'flight' I had chosen the alternative.

>I looked back at you with my blue eyes, now soft and warm, struggling to contain a chuckle despite the wand under my chin.

Glad you also got your wits back, Warwick. I know how much they are important to you.

>I smiled.
