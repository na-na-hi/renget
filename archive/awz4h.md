##Some thoughts from a talking trash bag
My name is Maximillian Elvis Presley, My middle and last name come from the fact that my Grandma was a huge Elvis fan and that i kinda looked like him. I lived with my Mom in Ohio, not gonna tell you where though, I'm not sure what happened to my Dad, maybe he died before she got pregnant, I only had one other sibling, my older sister, Ray, She had this infectious positive energy to her that can always brighten anyone's day, even though we got along well we always didn't see eye to eye some times, One time she wanted to get a dog, even though i absolutely despised dogs and wanted to get a lizard, we had a huge argument about it but we made up later.  We didn't grow up in a prosperous household, oh sure we had stuff like Food, Clothes, Toys, & a TV (Me and Ray aboslutely loved watching The Disney Channel & Toonami as a kid), and even a couple of game consoles, but nothing major, I did go to school but i got sick a lot, mostly because i was allergic to everything imaginable, and the sun would constantly give me headaches, so i had to wear sunglasses all the time whenever i went outside, but i loved going to the park, even though i just sat down by a tree and played on my Gameboy Color, i was pretty a pretty anti-social kid.
For the most part i lived a normal childhood... so when my mother died, that was the point where i stopped caring I gave up on trying to live, i couldn't take it any more. We moved to my Grandma's place, and when i was shown my room i immideately shut myself in, Ray tried to help but i didn't care, I didn't want to eat, or sleep, or do anything, all i wanted to do was hide away and rot, I wanted every bug in my room to devour my body until there was nothing left of me... I'm currently 22 years old, and i still feel like this, that is, until i woke up as literal trash...
