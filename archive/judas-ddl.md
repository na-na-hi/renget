## Joining the Drive
Go to https://groups.google.com/d/forum/judasddl, and click `Join Group`.
If you can't see it, you might've already joined. Try to [actually access the drive](#actually-accessing-the-drive) and see what happens.

This popup should appear. It doesn't matter what you put in there, just press `Join Group` again.

You now have access to the Judas DDL.
Google Groups will still say `You don't have permission to access this content`. (like [this](https://i.slow.pics/LpttwcZR.png)) **This is fine.**
We're not using the group as a mailing list, just as a way to get loads of people into a drive. Even if you did have permission, you wouldn't see anything interesting. The interesting stuff is somewhere else. (namely, the drive)
## Actually accessing the Drive

If you've followed the steps listed above correctly, you should now be able to access the Drive.

Go to https://drive.google.com/drive/shared-drives.
If you can see the drive, great! Enjoy your anime.

If you can't, don't worry. It's probably in `Hidden shared drives`.

Lo and behold, it is there!

You'll probably want to right-click it and do `Unhide shared drive`, so it'll be less of a pain to get to in the future.

You can now use the drive. Enjoy!

## FAQs

### Why is `x` missing from the drive?
#### New upload
Episodes are added 3 days after the release on Nyaa. If, and _only_ if, 3 days have passed since the torrent was uploaded, you should probably ping a member of staff about it.
Delay is by whatever timezone currently lines up with Judas' sleep schedule.
#### Something before 2019-09-28
It's probably in `Judas - DDL/[Judas] Bluray releases/My old releases as member of Hakata Ramen group/`
#### Something more recent
Google might've nuked it. Probably worth asking about just in case.
### How do I enable subtitles in the Google Drive player?
You don't. The Drive player doesn't support the subtitle format Judas (and any other anime group worth their salt) uses, and it re-encodes the video. You want to watch Judas encodes, not YouTube encodes.
Download the video and watch it locally. If you need a player, do `?players` in any channel, and the bot should give you some recommendations.
### Why bother with making it private?
so google doesn't nuke it again
### It says I don't have permission, help!
go back to [the start of the guide](#joining-the-drive), and read it properly this time 
### I can't read.
