#### Jupiter's MHA tier list

>Rosethorn
The homeroom teacher. The first impression I got from this build was a fetish build whose maker didn't want to be called out for it.

What baffles me is that anon flavored her as a fatgum kind of brawler back in the day, but she can't even enhance herself, so she's either wailing on people with super duper strength who are tired, or people with super duper stamina who are physically weak. Also needs more fleshing out on her relationship with her nemesis.

Still, I can see her reaching the top 10 through popularity, and she’s a fitting choice for Shiketsu’s staff. I put Rosethorn in the mediocre tier, she’s not a bad character/build, but also not above the curve.

>Birdy
Schizo kino. Anon could have made 2 different characters, but he chose to make 2 characters sharing the same QP and XP, so I have to kneel. However, besides a wacky quirk, there’s not much going on for her character. I put her at mediocre, interesting design but not much else.

>Popsy
A cool ability that complements her design, plus a good backstory about a heroine down on her luck. I don’t have anything bad to say about this character, and she’s not lacking in anything to make her mediocre. Normally, I’d put her in Good Tier, but her writefags elevate the clown to the “sparks joy” tier.

>Astoria Belmont
The character is fine on paper, but since she’s one of the few people who is specified to have 2 different quirks (tulpa + borrow), I would have liked to see the backstory reason for that. The quirk compulsion is a teeny bit of a reach for the character. Overall, fun personality, lacking backstory, mediocre tier.

>Sunlight Man
His backstory is downright bizarre. Even considering “the hero system” abandoning his family (whatever the fuck that means), heroes do not work for free. They get paid for solving crises. The number one hero of the USA would have plenty to leave for his family if he died, unless he wasted every single paycheck or refused the money, but that kind of thing should be specified. But also, despite the system abandoning his family, they let him go after multiple arrests and offer him accommodations for a top school in Japan?

Bobby’s story does not fit the setting he’s in. His personality and design are ok, but nothing outstanding. Imma have to put him in a bad tier.

>Bogey
A straightforward villain who targets youngsters. Simple power, simple backstory, simple design. Mediocre.

>Mauler
I did not like him at the start, but his rivalry with Ippon elevated him to a good tier. Simple design, solid backstory, and a power that makes for fun fights with his biggest opponent.

>Dark Seer
Rather bland personality wise, had potential as a precog character but the creator did nothing with it. I don’t like his design. Mediocre tier. 

>Tall Man
I wish he’d put more detail on his affliction. “deleterious effect on the constitution of humans.” Does that mean exhaustion? Weakened immune system? His backstory places him as a forest rescue hero + glowie, but he didn’t even take rescue hero as an option. I feel like this was a character made solely to contrast with Greenfinger and there’s not much else to him. Bad.

>Goldorado 
Lotta backstory, but some of it is wacky. Most of the world, including Japan, considers the quirk singularity theory reserved for villainous cults. Anon tried to add setting stuff to his character, which I can appreciate, but he should have made him a humarise child soldier instead of a government one. It seems this character is trying to have the benefits of being government sponsored (training from a young age) without the big downside (government breathing down your neck), while also gaining points from it (held back? what?)

I have mixed feelings about this build, but in the end, I decided to put him in the bad tier.

>Desperaido
Same wacky backstory and similar power to his brother, but the former ironically fits him a bit better since he was a failed project who turned villain. Still fumbled with the lore, but it feels more palatable. Mediocre.

>Tatarimokke
I just think he’s neat. His design is good, his quirk is cool, his motives are somewhat refreshing. Just like Popsy, normally in “good” tier, but the writefags around him elevate him to the top.

>Seiryu and Karma
Rated them together because their designs and personalities fit too well. Props for both anons for cooking up these nemeses, they have chemistry and spark joy inside me. Looking forward to more interactions between them.

>Noctiluca
Didn’t like the character at first, but that was just my bias against vigilantes. She has grown on me, but I’ll still put her in mediocre because there’s nothing above average about her.

>Challenger
Everything about him is good except the costume. He has a cool build, a cool backstory, a cool quirk, decent writefags, and oozes with soul. However, somehow he wasn’t enough to spark joy. Maybe I’m just not that interested in high school romance shenanigans.

>Mirror Devil
A mediocre character that was elevated into a superior tier by a very good backstory write-up. Although I feel like he gimped himself a bit too hard with his quirk drawback, I have to admit it adds a spice to the character. I’m looking forward to seeing him in action.

>Ryu-kishi
Hated the character for being a blatantly illegal build, but he redeemed himself by remaking the build and starting an entertaining character arc. If he focused more on interactions with the class and his family situation, instead of continuing the manwhore grindset, I would put him at the top.

>Overdose
I don’t have much to say about this one. He has a lot of potential, both as a serious character or a gag drug dealer for the freshmen, so I hope his anon participates more in the MP.

>Weiss Schwarz
I also don’t have much to say about this one. I liked the writefag she made, but there’s nothing much going for her. She’s mediocre.

>Aspara
I deeply dislike his quirk and design, I feel nothing for his backstory, but at least his personality is entertaining. 

>Karuga Ito
Cool concept and decent execution. His writefag was one of the first posted so I have a bit of a positive bias for him.

>Magnum Shrimp
Soulful, but hasn’t done a lot in the MP.

>Mark Matuli
I dislike that he took the skimpy option when his image has a suit. Point slut. His volatile body does not fit his quirk. Just a bland build, but it has some potential to climb the tiers.

>Hijack
I don’t have any strong feelings for this character, but I have high hopes for him in potential Shiketsu events.

>Fluegel
I hadn’t read any of her pieces before making this, but she’s a fun character. One of the few who took the plant manipulation template and made something interesting with it.

>Momotaro
Old Momo goes in “mediocre”, New Momo goes in “bad”, because I liked the old design better. This is the kind of character that takes a lot of effort to make it work due to the setting, but anon is doing a decent job.

>Archangel
This archetype isn’t my cup of tea, and I also dislike his quirk, but the interactions with his classmates save him from going into “bad”.

>Midas
The coolest villain build. Great design, lots of charisma, a fun power, just above average in all that matters. I expect great things from him.

>Sandatsu Owari
Another build that takes a lot of effort to make it work. Anon nerfed his own build by making a new condition for absorbing quirks, then gave the character easy access to death row inmates with a mom that works in tartarus. Bizarre. Odd. Peculiar. Hopefully the payoff to his arc is worth it.

>Ippon
Mediocre character elevated by the fights with his nemesis. Judo autism gives him maximum soul points.

>Smokin’ Sexy
He’s just a funky lil dude. I don’t have anything bad to say about him, but I don’t have anything special to say that I haven’t said before.

>Crazy Train
S O V L
O

Only a miserable monster wouldn’t feel any joy looking at that face. It also helps that he has a fun personality and quirk.

>Greenfinger
Anon put a lot of effort into this character but in the end he was too trapped by his vision of Kingpin but MHA. Also needs more work in the nemesis relationship. I was excited to see more of him, too bad he left after height autism wars.

>Orbit
Fun quirk, fun archetype, fun personality, but the design is a bit odd. Could spark joy if his creator put more effort in him.

>Aquarius
Vigilantes in MHA are people who do hero work without a license. Killing criminals and draining all their blood and viscera so people may never know if they’re alive or dead is not really hero work. That’s my only peeve with this character, anon really should have put “other” in her type. And also found a nemesis instead of ~~writing~~ posting about being the parent for another build. Y’know what? I’m just gonna put her in “bad”.

>Hydra
Has done nothing in the MP but his appearance in fight dub club earns him a sentence or two. He has a lot of potential for interacting with other students, and also

>Koreans
Pinned them all together because I have a hard time differentiating between them. Even though they are mass produced k-pop inspired builds, I can sense soul from them. Anon does a good job writing bitchy asians, and that’s the thing making them even appear in this tier list.

>King Billy
An exemplary senior build. His backstory is like Bobby’s, but not bad. Also one of the first to writefag, which feeds my biased self.

>Mahoudeva
He was “good”, but the election writefag elevated him to a new tier. I think he has the second most potential for greatness in his class, but I can’t quite put it into words why. Maybe it’s the potential for character development? The mind-breaking shenanigans he could start?

>Blackout
I think I just like reading about these awkward kinds of characters. Her quirk is also a fun one.

>Capture Cloth
Didn’t have a lot of faith in this one, but after the build update and newest writefags, I can safely say it’s a banger build. Good design, cool quirk, somewhat compelling backstory.

>Flying Force
She almost made it to good before deciding to bring back the zenkai thing. Same as Jugo: I do not like her quirk or design, but her personality does shine through in the writefags, saving her from the bad tier.

>Yamata
This one sparked joy in me just from the relationship chart. Cool quirk, a backstory that complements another character I like, and an entertaining personality.

>Yako
The build with the most potential in her class, by virtue of having several builds related to her before she even started high school. Good luck to the anon behind her. I do not like ki user builds, but she has a good flavor description for her ki quirk, so I give her a pass. 

>Karaburan
The laziness of the anon behind this one drags it down to the bottom. Ideally the principal should be more on top of the school events, but another anon is the one doing them.
