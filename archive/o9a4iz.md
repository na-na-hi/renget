#Potion Pete Relationship Chart

Ella:
Pete would definitely be an arms supplier for her.
"Hey, like that new Golem weapon? Made it just for you!"
"Whatever, old man."
"Ah, to be young..."
*Pete is mid 30-s*
They definitely would see eye-to-eye on the whole "killing the gods" thing. Pete is ALSO uncaring enough about the whole "killing people who piss me off" thing that Ella has that he would not try and stop her. He'll bring back everyone anyway! Although, he would definitely send her off somewhere else to get new parts if he had to meet with someone who's a bit racist to elfs for information. AND there might be some issues with "bring back everyone" if it includes gods...

Carmen:
"C'mon, don't you think it would be *nice* to survive the Silence?"
"...Maybe."
A ripe source for information. Pete would respect her enough to leaver her alone if she didn't want to talk with him *eventually*, but he'd be ecstatic to talk with someone who actually knows about MYS and would be a bit bummed if she didn't. Convincing her to go along with his scheme would be great!

Bastion:
Uhhh.
"So, what do you think about joining me on my quest to survive the Silence?"
"That could be a fine new purpose."
OR
"So, what do you think about joining me on my quest to survive the Silence?"
*Bastion then smashed the Golem relaying this message to pieces*
Not a whole lot about her, honestly. Don't think I can make too good of a guess. He would appreciate a blood sample, though. He isn't dumb enough to put a target on his back that obviously (like trying to take it through force) but maybe he would try and scavenge a piece of her from a battle.

Kin'ike:
"You want you and your son to survive the Silence?"
"...Are you threatening me?"
"That came out wrong."
Possible ally, but then again... Pete may be a little too eccentric for him, as Kin'ike seems quite down to earth. They would definitely be good as business partners, however, as Pete would be able to supply potions and Golems as needed. Potions seem like they would be more useful to Mr. Frog.

Caligula:
"-and then once I gain time travel-"
"STOP! You had me at time travel. That is, if it's true."
Definitely a good business relationship, Caligula would be a bit annoyed, but I think he would manage. If he ever learns about Pete's plan, (and believes it is feasible) he would be very happy to see his friends from his backstory again.

Slaine:
Uhhh.
"So, what do you say about sticking it to good ol' Mana-Yood-Sushai?"
"Can I eat his corpse?"
"...Y...Yes??"
Pete would have a similar to relationship with him as Pete would with Ella. Pete would supply him, not ask too many questions, give vague answers, and hope it all ends well. The future is future Pete's problem.

Rinh:
"Alright, how much?"
"I didn't think you were the type, Pete..."
"What are you talking about? Of course I want you to spelunk in those ruins! How much?"
"Oh."
Business (relationship) as usual. Pete gives money and Golems. Rinh finds magic secrets. Win-win! I hope she doesn't ask for a "custom made" Homonculus...

Kalnar:
"Alright, how much?"
"Free."
"We can negoti- WAIT, REALLY?"
Pete would ask him for a really important thing if he gets the chance, because he knows you usually only get one thing out of Kalnar (Pete is well versed in the folklore of places he visits, he finds it interesting). Pete would also try and get a conversation with him while he's on the way out, and try and get him on his side. If he can't then "Oh, well". If he can then he would be a VERY useful ally.

Aterui:
Business relationship.
"Hey, like that new Golem weapon? Made it just for you!"
"It's passable."
"P-passable!? That's... fine. M-my feelings aren't hurt or anything."
If Aterui gets wind of the whole "wage war with Sish" thing he may have an issue. If Aterui gets wind of the whole "innocents will be brought back later" thing he will PROBABLY have an issue. Pete will try and keep things relatively under wraps, but he WILL tell him if they become friends, and from there... we'll see. Maybe they can reach an agreement where Pete gets more careful in exchange for his service?

Maha:
"Heh. That's what she said..."
"I told you that joke three hours ago, Pete."
They enjoy each other's company enough. See Rinh for any possible "unsavory" Homonculus requests. If MYS gets brought up, I can see Maha deciding that he would like to live past the alarm clock. He might also enjoy any Homonculus horse Pete may give him.

Unmei:
"You want to survive the End, right, Unmei?"
"Indeed."
"I have a proposition."
Pete and Unmei agree on "survive Silence". They also agree on "save innocents". They most likely disagree on the part where they execute the plan. Unmei may stick around even if she thinks Pete is crazy, because he definitely seems like he needs guidance. That guidance probably won't do anything, because Pete is *dead set* on what he's doing, but it's the thought that counts. After she realizes he is a lost cause, she may continue to stick around (because he might be her only shot at surving the alarm clock), or she'll leave.


Téleios:
"Pete, your Golems seem... inadequate, compared to mine."
"W-we all have our strengths and weaknesses."
Pete will very much be happy to work with her. His Golems are imperfect, as they have not reached the potential level of a "Hero", and are merely at the level of an "Alkian war airship". "Hero" level is likely required to make a Homonculus with enough mastery of ELE;(Y), and even though MAYBE he could do it with his current level of Homonculi working together (Truths, baby!), he does not want to take many chances. And hey, maybe Téleios could learn something about Homonculi or Dream from him! On the subject of Sish, Téleios will probably have problems, as she's a bit of a fan. Maybe she could be convinced with the idea that Sish would only be dead for a *little* while, or simply convinced he isn't all too great, but there will definitely be a talk. Pete will try and delay this talk, in fear of losing a really good source if it goes wrong.

Jahi:
"At least she's letting people know about Mana-Yood-Sushai."
A good deal of conflict between them. Pete is confused at why someone would *accept* the End, while Jahi is confused (or maybe she isn't) that someone would *avoid* it. Pete will definitely not interfere with her, as letting people know about MYS will (probably) help his cause. Jahi *may* interfere with his plans, but I assume she would just decide that even if he does survive, it doesn't concern her. Maybe Pete could even strike a deal with her?

Suze:
"Wait, you can use Dream?!"
"Yes-"
"YEAH!!!"
Suzerain is one of the few people who can actually use ELE;(Y). She would be VERY helpful to Pete. Pete is also quite... warm, I guess, and would be receptive to any help she needed. She also would like to not get hit with the alarm clock. I can definitely see them working together.

Lona:
"Alchemy SUCKS! Brewing is the *real* stuff, kid!"
Pete, contrary to her mentor, would approve of witchcraft. He also would feel bad about her mental condition, and blame the gods for allowing such a tome to even exist. He would try and help her with her pursuit of knowledge (it also helps him) and maybe she could change some of his views on alchemy, or teach him something about potions he is unaware of.
"Golems are NOT alchemy. Neither are Homonculi! Don't let anyone tell you otherwise! I know NOTHING about alchemy, and I get by just fine!"
Him disliking alchemy is something I came up with just now because I realized I never gave it to him. He just can't get a hang of it for the same reason he can't reach the final level of Golem-making.

August:
"Hey, using a sword and a gun is cool, right? What if you could use a Golem that LOOKS like a sword and a gun!"
"...Go on."
Same arms dealer thing as before. Time travel could *also* be of interest to August. Not to mention, ESS;(LOVE) is something August has some knowledge on, and it may be the key to Pete's plan. I could definitely see some business between them.

Caniara:
"Let's see, I need a Golem to carry me, a Golem to serve me, a Golem to open doors- you're writing this down, right?"
"Y-Yes..."
Here's how I see things happening. Caniara would get an offer for a relatively simple mission and accept when she saw the rewards being actual servants. She would commission quite a few Golems for aid... and end up not completing the mission. She would come back, having broken all the Golems, and demand more. Pete accepts... in exchange for another mission. The cycle begins anew. Worry not! She has TOOLS+, so maybe she'll get a Golem or potion that lets her complete one of the missions! She will then come back, because she broke the rest of them and wants more. If their business fails, Pete tells her about MYS and has her run wild, telling everyone she can about how messed up it all is! Maybe she will work for Pete of her own volition, but I can't imagine she would be entrusted with anything too important.

Ugoki:
"Ugoki, is that wound alright? Would you like me to heal it?"
"It is fine. My body can evolve, heal, and adapt!"
"...That's rad!"
Ugoki will find no discrimination from Pete. Pete will BEG for a sample of Ugoki's blood. EVOLVE could be Pete's ticket to completing his plan, and a Homonculus could be grown from Ugoki's DNA. He may try and take it by force, simply because it could be *that* important to a breakthrough, but he would exhaust every option he had previously. He also wouldn't ever kill Ugoki if they were on the same side, no matter how much blood he'll need. You can bet he'll volunteer to "get the body ready for the funeral" if Ugoki ever dies, though.

Vajar:
"I've been scrying on you, Potion Pete."
"I'm flattered! (*And a little creeped out.*)"
When has combining two armies NOT been helpful? ...Don't answer that. Anyway, they actually have very similar goals, just differences in how to reach them. Pete would appreciate any Sish expertise, and necromancy could be interesting in Homonculi, and Vajar enjoys extra help, and necromancy could STILL be interesting in Homonculi! Vajar has some disbelief in Pete's plan, but if they could all stay alive long enough, and Vajar could find all the bodies he can, Sish may not have to be an issue, and Pete's plan can go without a hitch! ...The letting everyone survive part, anyway, and Sish might still be interesting for bodies that can't be raised. Vajar will definitely have issues with MYS, as that puts a damper on the whole immortality thing, so at least he and Pete will agree on that.

Amara:
"Alright, Pete! Let's test out THIS potion on me!"
"I'm not sure this is a good idea..."
Amara is a very good alchemist. Pete has interests in technology and brewing potions. They will definitely agree for at least the pursuit of science, and she would probably wish to live past MYS waking up. Pete will not make her a Homonculus with its purpose to be her lover.

Cormelia:
"Mister Pete! Remember me?"
"Oh, hello Cormelia! ...I never made it to the springs, did I..."
Pete and her are currently acquaintances, just like Maha, so they will probably work together just fine. I imagine living past the Alarm Clock would be of interest to her, as well. I hope Pete doesn't make too much of a Frog-Homonculus-Horror-Project to upset her.

Khuldor:
"That is a nice 'stache, my friend!"
"Uh, your facial hair is... nice, as well, Pete."
Pete and Khuldor will likely see each other as academic equals. Between ESS;(KIB), TA HIERA, and CHAKRA, Khuldor could be quite helpful in Homonculi development. Pete will also ask for his facial hair regiment, as Pete finds his own moustache far too frizzy from time to time. Khuldor would also be interested in a time travel development, I presume.

Corvus:
"Impressive!"
"My Golem-making skills, Pete?"
"Well, yes, but I was talking about your moustache! You look so young, but it's quite mature!"
"..."
Pete would enjoy the knowledge of a master Golem-maker that does not have the potential to horribly backfire on him as much as Téleios could. Maybe, I don't know too much about him. I hope Corvus doesn't get envious of Pete in some way... Oh, he could learn about Homonculi from Pete, as well! And I'm sure at least one potion Pete makes could be used as some good oil.

Skelly:
"...Who?"
Pete and Skelly would have been best friends. Unfortuantely, Skelly is dead.
