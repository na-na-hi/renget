You stared out into the plain, almost boring landscape from the bus window. Some people probably loved this stuff. Green hills, lush trees swaying with the wind, clear blue skies. This was probably someone else's idea of a great view. Not you though. 

Then again, maybe the slightly annoyed mood you carried from what happened earlier today was influencing your thoughts. It was the whole reason you were even taking this bus ride in the first place. 

There wasn't any fish at the market. 

Usually this wouldn't be a problem for anyone, just buy something else. Thing is, meat goes fast at the market, and all that's left is the really bad stuff that the workers are probably gonna throw away anyway. 

Fish was relatively cheap, and much easier to get your hands on since apparently, most people who frequented the market just didn't have a taste for it. Which made you all the more confused as to why they had somehow run out. 

You needed it though, there was no way you were going to pay more for something that you liked less, so instead, you decided to take a trip to the Fishermen's docks and see if you could pay one of them upfront to get some for you. 

For now though, you just sat back in your bus seat and waited for your stop, which was still about thirty minutes away judging from the area. Just enough time for a short nap. 

----------------------------------------------------------------

You woke up tiredly, sluggishly exiting from the doors of the bus and looking around to find the entrance to the docks. 

Your eyes landed on a sign with an arrow pointing towards a dirt path into a forest that read "Fishermen's Dock's ahead". 

"Yep, this seems like the place." You thought to yourself, setting foot along the path and following it until you got to your destination.

As you walked, the forest slowly became more swamp-like. It got muddier and more humid, which was pretty unfortunate for you, considering you weren't wearing appropriate gear for that at all. Thankfully, it didn't look like you'd have to walk much longer. 

Just farther ahead, you could make out a fairly old-looking wooden shack. Loitering around it were what you guessed were fishermen, based on their attire. Some were laughing, drinking, or just hanging around talking to someone.

Despite you not being dressed anything like them and sticking out a fair bit, they paid you no mind as you walked past them and entered the shack. 

The first thing that hit you, maybe before you even opened the door, was the awful stench of fish that permeated throughout the room. You flinched at nearly every inhale, but you tried your best to ignore it as you looked for someone who could help you with what you needed. 

It looked like your best bet was with the Shark writing something down on a clipboard, he at least seemed to be working here. You slowly approached the counter he was sitting at, and knocked on the wood to get his attention. 

"What is it?" He asked, his gaze now focused on you. 

"Uh… Yeah, I was just wondering if you guys do solo jobs here?" The shark's eyes narrowed in confusion, so you explained yourself further. 

"Like, I was wondering if I could give one of you guys money in exchange for getting some fish for me? My market didn't have any today, and I really need it." 

He let out a small "Ahh" before shaking his head and continuing to write something down. 

"Sorry, we don't really do that here. It's like this, a town pays us for fish, and we send it out in bulk. As for your market situation, you're from the first town east of here, right?" 

You nodded. 

"We gave them fish about a month ago; not anymore, prices were way too low. Again, sorry." He explained, much to your disappointment. 

"No, it's alright, I get it." You responded, masking your true feelings. You turned around and began to walk away, upset that you had just wasted your time coming here. 

"Ay! Watcha doin' scaring away a paying customer, Small Fin?" Yelled a voice from far away, stopping you in your tracks. 

The shark lifted his head and turned around to the source of the voice, smirking a bit when he did. 

"Oh, it's you. Didn't know you were here today."

"Yeah, just came back actually. Looks like I'm just in time, too! You were really about to let this lad walk away with nothing but a frown on his face." 

Finally, you could see who the voice belonged to as he walked up to both of you. 

He was an eel: You hadn't seen many of them in your town, but he looked quite different from the ones you remember. For one, he was bigger than them, standing just a few inches taller than the shark, who already towered over you at about seven feet. 

Next thing about him was his build. Most eels were lanky, but this one had a very prominent beer-belly on him. He also had strong, burly working man arms to go along with it. It actually didn't look too bad on him, he carried the weight well. 

His skin was a dull, grey color, with the only difference being in the thick tail that dragged behind him, which was decorated with white spots that stopped at around the half-way point.  

And his attire was… A bit strange, to say the least. A bucket hat with several tags hanging from the brims, light brown cargo shorts, and a plain graphic-tee with an anchor on it. Which, you couldn't help but notice, highlighted his belly. 

"Hey! Kid, ya listening?" You heard, snapping you out of your thoughts.

"Huh? Oh! Sorry, I didn't hear you." 

The eel let out a low, deep laugh before speaking again. 

"Don't worry about it, I'll run it by ya again. See, instead of just payin' me to get some fish, I'll do ya one better, and for free too! All you gotta do is meet up with me on my run tomorrow, sound good?" He asked, smiling at you. 

Now that he was closer to you, you could more clearly make out the dim yellow glow of his eyes, accompanied by a faded gash on his right side. 

"I mean, I could, but can't I just pay you to do it?"

"Well, since I ain't really working here, you could just pay me to do it. More of a freelancer, not really a fan of schedules and all that. But I'm sure ya know the old saying 'bout teaching a man to fish, this'll be better for you and your wallet, promise." He finished, crossing his arms and looking at you with the same optimistic smile from before.

You really didn't care for learning how to fish. It seemed like too much work. But something about this guy made you want to say yes. After mulling it over in your head for a bit, eventually his good attitude, friendly personality, and maybe even your slight attraction to him won you over. 

"Alright, sure. I'll go with you on your run tomorrow." 

"Great! I'll see ya tomorrow then. Same time, maybe 'bout an hour earlier. That all right with you?"

You nod. "Yeah, I'm fine with that." 

"Alright then!" The eel exclaims, holding his hand out to you. 

You place your hand in his larger one and proceed to shake it. "Name's Kilroy by the way, I look forward to fishing with ya." 

----------------------------------------------------------------

The day came and went, and before you knew it, it was time to meet Kilroy for some fishing lessons. 

You took the same route as yesterday, riding the bus and getting off at the same spot, then walking through the forest until you found the shack again. 

You walked towards the shack, thinking he was in there waiting for you. Before you could enter, a waving figure from one of the docks caught your eye, so you moved towards it instead. 

"Ay! There he is! And here I was thinkin' ya left me out to dry!" 

The heavy accent of the voice immediately clued you in as to who it was, so you kept walking towards it until Kilroy was in your view. 

He was standing right on the edge of the docks, next to a boat that carried a net, a fishing pole, and a motor on the back. 

His outfit was a bit different from yesterday. He had a similar pair of cargo shorts, and the same hat, but his shirt now had two cartoon fish fighting over a worm on a hook. He also wore a pair of loose flip-flops that still let you see the sharp claws on his feet. 

"Well, I'm here." You began, looking out into the murky water that surrounded the both of you. "So, do we just start fishing, or….?"

He shook his head. "Bit eager there, ain't ya? Thought ya didn't wanna learn." He said, laughing a bit. "Almost. All that's left is for you to put on some proper gear for this, ain't no way in hell you're going out into the water like that."

He points to an outpost a bit further down. "There's some stuff in there, pick what ya need and come back, then we'll get started." 

You start walking, then stop and turn your head around. "How come you're not in any gear then, if it's so important?" 

He smirks. "I'm an eel, kid. This water doesn't really bother me, but to a humie like yourself, it just might." 

"Humie? That's a new one." You thought to yourself as you entered to get changed. 

----------------------------------------------------------------

You came out with a set of new clothes that you already kind of hated.

First was a pair of tall, rubber boots. Second, was some really long pants that reached up to your chest with a strap that went over your shoulders. And last was just one of the plain shirts that was around that you put on just so you wouldn't get yours dirty. 

You stepped out from the outpost and went back to Kilroy. 

He smiled as soon as he saw you. 

"Lookin' good, kid! You pull off the whole fishermen look pretty well." 

You roll your eyes. "Whatever." 

He laughs again before jumping into the boat, and lending a hand to you so you could get in as well. 

You gladly took his hand, admittedly a bit too scared to just jump into the rocking boat like he did. 

After getting in, you sat down and watched as Kilroy yanked the motor and set the boat into motion. 

"Ya ever been on a boat before?" Asked Kilroy, giving you a side glance as he continued working the motor.

"Once, when I was little, I think. Uh… Aren't I supposed to have a life vest for a boat this small?" You questioned, to which Kilroy just replied with a snort. 

"Don't worry, kid. You're safe with me. Just don't do anything too reckless and you'll be fine." 

They were just words, and you had no idea if he could even fulfill his promise, but they still calmed you down somehow. 

After the two of you had gotten a fair bit away from the docks, Kilroy stopped the motor and let the boat float in place. He then grabbed the fishing pole that was in the boat and handed it to you. 

"There's usually a lot of fish around this area, so this'll be a good place to start for a beginner." 

You nervously took the fishing pole in your hands and got into what you assumed was the position. You'd only ever seen people fishing from afar, or from a show, so you just mimicked what you remembered. 

"So do I just… Throw it in?" You spouted, rather dumbly. 

"Yeah, I guess you could." He sneered, a sly smile now plastered on his face, letting some of his sharp teeth show. "Doubt you'll get any fish to bite without some bait though." 

You smacked your head. Duh. 

"Heh, here. Lemme do it." 

He takes the pole from you for just a second, effortlessly skewering a worm onto the hook and giving it back to you. 

"There ya go. Always thought ya learn best by doing something yourself. So go ahead, just give it a try."

With that done, you finally threw the line into the water, and waited patiently for a fish to bite. Couldn't be that hard, right?

----------------------------------------------------------------

Wrong. 

One hour of standing on the boat, waiting for a fish to bite, and nothing. You never even felt the line so much as move ever since it hit the water. It was infuriating. 

So much so that eventually, you just started swinging the pole, hoping that a fish would be attracted by the moving object and just go for it. "It's at least better than doing nothing." You mused, shaking the pole once again. 

It was then when Kilroy began to laugh. You snapped back to him, slightly upset because you knew he was laughing at you. 

"What's so funny?" You jeered. 

"Nothin'. Just wondering what you think you're doin' shaking that pole like a rattlesnake is all. You're definitely not gonna catch anything like that." 

"Well what did you expect? I've never done this before, I don't know what I'm doing. And nothing even got close to biting before I started doing this, so what's the difference?" 

Kilroy then sighs. Getting up and moving over to you. 

"Alright, kid. Lemme show ya how it's done then." He says, reaching his arms out from behind you and placing them on top of yours, guiding your hands to different places on the fishing pole. 

"Look here. Ya gotta hold your hands closer together so you get a firmer grip. It's all about stillness, no fish is gonna go for a moving target. Make sense?"

"Y-Yeah…" You reply in a low, nervous tone. 

Kilroy had just pressed himself against you, and it felt… Intimate. 

For one, you could feel his belly nudging up against your back while he showed you how to clutch the pole. It made your heart beat faster, and you had to control your breathing so it didn't look suspicious. 

Second, his head was resting right on top of yours. 

And thirdly, his hands… You swore you could feel the strength in them. Even if he was being gentle with you. 

"Good, just like that. Now all ya gotta do is keep that position, and have some grit. They'll eventually bite, just don't get impatient and start swinging it around again." He joked, giving you a pat on the shoulder before sitting back down. 

----------------------------------------------------------------

You had to admit, it worked. 

It still took awhile, but you actually ended up catching some fish using the stuff you just learned. They weren't that big, but you were still a beginner, so that was to be expected. 

You were finally getting the hang of it, and it was all thanks to Kilroy. 

Kilroy…

You turned back, laying your eyes on the eel-man once more. He was lying back, arms rested behind his neck and seemingly having himself a nice nap. 

Looking at him now, you could feel your face heat up. That's when you knew you were in trouble. Cause that meant you were crushing on him. 

Damnit. 

You just couldn't lie to yourself. Kilroy had a unique charm to him. He was nice, friendly, and his accent was kind of growing on you. 

And honestly? He was pretty handsome. To you at least, others might not find him so appealing, but in your eyes he was easily someone you wouldn't mind spending the night with. And maybe even a little more. 

"See somethin' you like, boy?" He said suddenly, startling you and making you jump. 

It was then you realized that Kilroy wasn't asleep at all, he was wide awake, you just couldn't tell since his eyes were hidden under the shade of his hat. 

"N-No…" You stammered, fumbling your words unconvincingly. 

"Darn." He replied, his now familiar smirk showing itself once again. "And here I was thinkin' you were kinda cute. Guess that's why you should never get your hopes up, ey?" 

You physically pause.

What did he just say?

"Ah well, guess you're not interested in what this old eel has to offer. I'll stop teasing ya then." 

Your eyes widen and you rush to explain yourself. 

"Well no, I actually, uh… I did like what I saw. I just didn't say it cause… Well, you know, I didn't know you were…" 

"Into men?" He said, bluntly. 

You scratched your head awkwardly. 

"Yeah…" 

Kilroy then let out a loud, rumbling laugh. "Heh, s'all good kid. It's not exactly the type of thing I go sharing around with everybody either." He says, still laughing a bit before gesturing to you. 

"Just had a feelin' about you though." 

You wanted to ask what he meant by that, but you were too embarrassed. The next few minutes were awkward, neither of you talking due to the information that was now in the air. 

Once again, Kilroy starts laughing.

"Ain't no need to be shy, boy! We're both the same when you think about it. Couple of peas in a pod!" He exclaimed joyously, but you were still too hesitant to talk. 

"I know, how 'bout something to break the ice?" 

You turn to him, curious about what he had in mind. 

"Ever tasted eel before?" 

You angle your head with a bewildered look in your eyes. 

"Uh, no? Can't say that I have." You answer, still thinking about his peculiar question. 

He smiles. "Well do ya want to?" 

Oh. Ooooh. 

You feel a bit simple, not getting what he meant the first time. But still, you had to make sure you weren't misinterpreting him so as to not make an even bigger fool of yourself.

"What do you mean?" 

He snorts. "I think ya get what I'm putting down. C'mere, son." He says, and maybe you were just imagining it, but it sounded a bit… seductive? Regardless, it made you excited. 

He was gesturing towards himself now with one of his clawed fingers, and you accepted his invitation by slowly moving closer to him.

You gulped. With every inch you advanced, Kilroy's predator-like gaze seemed to grow in intensity. The glow of his eyes seemed brighter, his teeth seemed sharper, but all that really did was make you even more eager. 

"I'm not gonna bite you know. I mean, not unless you're into that type of thing, then I'll think about."

His words were addictive. They just made you want more. 

You took another step closer, leaning down a bit to get into a good position. But next thing you knew, your lips were pressed against Kilroy's, and you were kissing him. 

You could feel one of his hands at the back of your head, gently pushing you into him. His other hand was at your side, massaging you with soft motions. 

The actual kiss was very nice as well. Kilroy was passionate and fierce. You were moaning into his maw only seconds after he'd started. 

Oh, he was so good. 

That's when he really started getting into it. The tongue he'd apparently been hiding from you came out completely, in all it's full length splendor. He invaded your mouth, wrestling with your tongue and hitting places in it only he could. 

It was unlike anything you had ever experienced. Different, for sure, but pleasurable all the same. Kilroy had complete control over you in this situation, and while you didn't mind letting him take the reigns, you wanted to have some fun too. You could feel your groin begging for it. 

You continued to let him assault your mouth with the most sensual, genial kiss you've ever received. All the while your hands moved down his broad back. Starting from his fins near his neck, right up until you reached his shorts. 

The instant you attempted to pull them down, Kilroy pulled you off of him, slowly. Rumbling a deep laugh as he did. 

"You youngins. Always wanting to get straight to the action, huh?"

"Oh god, sorry. I just-" 

"Shhh…" Whispered Kilroy, placing a finger on your lips. "Kid, I'm just messin' with ya. Trust me, I'd go right here on this boat if I could, but this rickety ass thing just ain't built for it." 

You nod. But still, you were a bit impatien. And horny. 

"Why not though?" You nearly whined. 

"Cause the boat will probably turn over and send us right into water, ya knucklehead." He answers, blowing a bit of air out of his snout. "Jeez, really thinkin' with your dick on that one, ain't ya?" 

You playfully punch his shoulder in return. "Shut up, you wanted it just as badly as me. I could feel your boner when you shoved your tongue down my throat." 

"Yeah, you're not wrong." He admitted. "How 'bout this. We take this boat back to the docks and head over to my place. It ain't too far from here. Plus, I really don't wanna wait till tomorrow for this." 

You agreed, and gave him the O.K. to go back to his place. 

On the way back, you insulted his motor for being too slow. Kilroy told you it was one of the fastest on the market. 

He got a real kick out of it when you told him it was still too fucking slow. 

----------------------------------------------------------------

Finally, after what seemed like forever, you got to the place Kilroy called home. For some reason, you didn't expect his house to actually look… Well, nice. 

It was a fairly modest, two floor house a couple meters away from the shack. Not a bad location for him, considering his work. 

He opened the door for you and invited you inside. Your eyes wandered to every wall in his house, examining all the details briefly. 

The only thing it confirmed was that Kilroy was actually really into fishing. Like, more than just a job. He had a decent amount of fishing memorabilia and decorations on his wall. 

He even had one of those retro, animatronic fishes that sung songs when you turned them on. Cute. 

Just then, you felt his hands on your waist again as he leaned down and placed a soft kiss on your neck. 

"Why don't ya head on up to my bedroom? I'm gonna go freshen up." He whispered, beginning to walk away to what you assumed was his shower. "Won't be long, promise." 

"You don't have to if you don't want to…" You blurted out to him, grabbing one of his hands before he could leave. 

"What do ya mean?" 

You gulp. "You… Don't smell… bad?" You confessed, already wishing you had just kept your mouth shut. 

Kilroy looked puzzled for just a moment, before everything seemed to click into place for him, returning his sly smile to his face. 

"Ahh, I getcha. Don't worry kid, I'm not gonna judge ya." 

Relief flowed through you as soon as you heard those words. 

"In fact, that might actually be better. Means we get right to it." He said, making his way upstairs as you followed. 

"Oh, and don't worry, I'm an eel. Ain't no grime on me or anything, so it's just my natural scent. Figured you might like knowing that." 

You shot him a look. "What? How does that work? I mean, not that it isn't really hot, but how?" 

He shook his head. "Dunno. Something about slime or somethin'. I never paid much attention in Biology class, so I couldn't really tell ya." 

Finally you were in his bedroom. It looked relatively plain compared to his living room, but you could care less about that now. 

You heard Kilroy shut the door behind him before approaching you. His large frame towering over you as he stood only inches away.

"You ready for this?" His tone now low, and guttural. You eagerly shook your head yes and watched with elation as his hands reached down towards his cargo shorts, unbuckled them, and in one swift motion, pulled them down.

What was revealed to you was nothing short of amazing. 

Unsurprisingly, his dick was pretty big, you just knew it had to be from that time on the boat. But it's shape was where it got interesting. It was long, slimy, and had all types of curves to it. Prehensile, you think the term was? 

"Well don't just stare at it, c'mon, get to work." He breathed, inching himself, and his length towards you. 

You got down on your knees, grabbing a hold on his shaft and putting it in your mouth. 

Not even one second later, you could hear a whimper leave Kilroy's maw. Clearly, you were doing a good job. 

You took it as deep as it could go, and tried your best to give Kilroy the best blowjob he ever had, even if it meant learning to like the bitter taste his dick carried. 

Next, you dragged your tongue from his base, all the way to the very tip of his length, emitting another moan from the eel as his large hands ran through your hair. 

You repeated the whole process once more before stopping, and just looking at Kilroy's very impressive manhood. 

"Ahh… Careful where ya point that thing, might poke an eye out…" Rasped the eel, breathing heavily. 

You bring yourself back up, leaning in for a kiss which Kilroy happily gives you. His mouth is bigger than yours, but you both made it work somehow. 

Instead of going in for another kiss though, you instead venture just a bit farther down to his pits. His scent was strong. Earthy, and undeniably male. 

He laughed a bit, but raised his arm to let you indulge in your odd fervor. You pushed yourself deeper into the crook of his arm and gave it another hard whiff, letting Kilroy's essence shoot through your nose and becoming lost in it. 

Because he was an Eel, there was no hair there. Just sweat, skin, and his natural brand. Something you appreciated very much. 

You were so consumed by his musk you hadn't even noticed how hard your dick had gotten. So much so that it became almost painful having it constrained by your pants. 

"Damn, kid. Don't breathe so hard, ya might just pass out." 

"Sorry. You just smell really good, I couldn't help myself." You explained, still a bit too euphoric to really be paying full attention.

"Thanks, I guess. But, since I just did you a favor, you mind doing one for me and lying down on your back, right on the bed?" 

You followed without question, taking off all your clothes off before lying down face up just like he wanted. 

Before the thought of what he had in mind even crossed your head, Kilroy was already looming over you. His round belly was placed right on top of you. And although it wasn't much, since Kilroy was still plenty strong, you could feel the weight of his stomach on you, and it felt nice. 

"Get ready, kid. I'm gonna rock your world in a couple seconds." He claimed, spreading some clear liquid you guessed was lube onto his already wet cock before throwing the bottle to one side of the room. 

And truthfully, he did. 

His dick hit spots within you that you didn't even know were possible. Each thrust was almost a promise for a new sensation, and it never let you down. 

"Ah… Fuck… You're so good… so damn good…." 

He moaned, speeding up as he said so. 

"Ah… Damnit, where have you been hiding all my life? Ah, goddamn…" 

He was close, you could tell. He was biting his lip, which made his sharp teeth peek out from the gums of his mouth. His large hand also became entwined with yours as he reached for it and put it in his. His grasp tightened with every thrust.

"I gotta… No, we gotta make up for lost time… I wanna take ya and just… Just…" 

But before he could finish whatever he wanted to say, he came. He pulled out just in time too, but unfortunately for him, his seed ended up getting splattered all over his floor, with some drops being spread on the blankets. 

Kilroy didn't seem mad though. In fact, he seemed very happy. His face only conveyed bliss. 

He shot you a warm smile, before looking down and staring at your still hard erection with a look of bemusement. 

"Haven't cum yet, eh? Well that's no good, it'd be rude of me to stop if I'm the only one getting my rocks off" He says, leaning down and grabs both your wrists, pulling you up. 

He gets close to your ear and whispers in a low, husky voice. 

"It's your turn now, boy. Get up." 

You do as he says, almost painfully trying not to show just how excited you are over him letting you do this. You watch in awe as Kilroy steps on the bed, and arches his back forward, lifting his thick tail up and showing off his shapely, sculpted ass. 

You moved forward, placing your hands on each of his cheeks and just feeling them out. They were soft, but still had some clear muscle under them. You grabbed one with your hands, watching as his skin flexed and moved with each action. 

You then spread them apart, giving you a clear view of Kilroy's pucker, which made your dick jump once again. You could just do it right away, but you knew there was something else you wanted more, and it would be a shame to waste this opportunity on just a nice fuck. 

You noticed that Kilroy's tail had begun to move side to side with a hypnotic sway, probably getting a bit impatient by now. He'd have to wait a bit to get what he wanted though. 

Sorry, Kilroy. 

So you just went for it. You spread his round globes apart, and smashed your nose right into the cleft of his taint, breathing in as much of his masculine musk as you could with one heavy whiff. 

And goddamn. If the smell of his pit was good, the smell of him over here was downright intoxicating. No, It was indescribable. 

Admittedly, you were a bit hesitant at first to just along with your whims, but Kilroy was right about that eel thing, he just smelled like him. And Kilroy smelled good. Like, really good. 

You were now so dazed from his musk that everything about him seemed hotter then it did before. His aromatic flesh worked like an aphrodisiac on you. 

His smile, his build, his accent, everything. It all just seemed so much more attractive. Fuck, who were you kidding, he was perfect. 

You leaned back down, right into the same dank spot under his tail that was so rich with his musk, and breathed even more than before, letting his scent burn through your nostrils and appreciating it, even as it lingered. Never had you been so attracted to someone that just the natural, pungent smell of their person was enough to get you this worked up. 

You only stopped yourself because you knew you would've passed out if you didn't. You probably could've come just like this. No hands required. Fuck, Kilroy was a gift. 

"Damn kid, I've heard it's respectful to smell your meal before you eat it and all that, but ya don't gotta flatter me." He joked. "I must smell real good back there if you can't help but go for seconds."

Judging by the sound of surprise from Kilroy's yelp at the beginning, he had absolutely no idea that you were going to do what you just did. 

Still, you had your fix, and you were still riding off the weird sex-high your brain was in, so giving Kilroy a good rimjob seemed more tempting now than ever. And you needed to make him feel good too, it wasn't all about you.

So for the final time, you dug back into Kilroy, letting your tongue lap up all the sweat you could before running it over it his pucker, making him moan with pleasure.

You spread him apart again, sinking your tongue into him and making sure to enjoy every whimper that you were able to elicit from the eel. 

Not that you had him ready, there was only one thing left. Problem was, you could already feel yourself about to blow. There was no way in hell you were lasting more than even five seconds inside Kilroy. 

"This is gonna have to be fast, I feel like I'm gonna blow in like two thrusts. Is that ok?" You ask. 

"Of course it is! Don't apologize, just get in there and give me a good poundin', I've been waiting for it."

Well, he's the boss. 

You angled yourself just right, took hold of his tail and as quickly, and hard as you could, buried yourself into Kilroy with all the strength you could muster. 

You cried out in bliss as soon as you entered his warm insides, and Kilroy himself let out a ferocious roar.

You weren't lying when you said you were close, only one more thrust later in the hot, tight passage of Kilroy's ass and you had to pull out. 

Panting as you busted your load right over his back, your mind was so filled with endorphins you could barely even assess the situation anymore. You were just too happy. 

Kilroy turned around and held his arms out to you. You collapsed into his arms with no resistance, feeling content to let yourself rest within his strong, protective grasp. 

You both make eye contact once more. His previous lust-filled gaze was gone, and replaced with a much more warm emotion. It made your heart melt. 

Eventually, you both just ended up laughing. His grip around you tightened a bit as he shifted his head closer, tenderly nibbling on your ear with caution, given how sharp they were. 

It stayed like that for a while as you both took the time to appreciate the afterglow. Kilroy later stopped and just rested his head on your shoulders. 

"Darn." He spoke up. 

"What happened?" 

He paused for a moment before answering you.

"Sorry, but I'm pretty sure I just fell in love with you." 

You chortled. "Don't worry, I'm pretty sure I'm in love with you too." You responded, earning yourself another kiss from Kilroy, right on your cheek. 

"Couple of lovestruck fools, ay? You know what you gotta do now right?" 

You look at the eel curiously. "No, what?"

"You gotta take me out on a date." 

You smile. "Really?" 

"Mm Hmm." He hums. "Call me old fashioned if ya want, but I wanna go out on a nice date with you, haven't done something like that in a good while." 

He grins, and you can tell by the odd curves on his smile that he's a bit embarrassed saying all this. 

"Maybe we can go to that nice restaurant just outside town. A good steak, some wine, and I'll be like putty in your fingers." 

"Sound's good to me." You agree, kissing the top of his snout. "Tomorrow then?" 

"Yeah, tomorrow sounds good." 

"Love you."

"Yeah, I love ya too."
