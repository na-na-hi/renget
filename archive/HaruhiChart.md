"Senpai is... How do i put it? She's reliable, very diligent and understands her responsability as our senpai.  I've helped her organize documents a few times so i understand how much effort she puts into helping everyone in the club but... Isn't it hard not to be a little scared of her? I'm not talking about using the fears of others to talk but of her nature. Normally with Wrath sinners all you need to do is to stay clear of certain landmines, but senpai is always closed off only ever transforming into a wild beast in battle. So what happens if she goes a little too far in battle or worse, what if that beast wakes up outside of battle?"

"I try to help this brat out of the kindness of my heart and what do i get in return? Wrath sinners can be so insufferable and he's the worst kind. Can't he at least understand that to live in society we need a bare minimum of decorum? He's just an animal we throw against the demonic and supernatural, i can hardly believe that he's able to live in society as a human being"

"Improving and changing yourself to a better version, wouldn't it be convenient to have an eye to help with that? I sure would have loved having something like that.... Unfortunately Naoki-san is an incorrigible idiot, there isn't much point in changing your body if you let your weak self leak out is there? Even worse, he's a pervert obsessed with sluts, disgusting."

"Akari-senpai or should i call her boss? It's not like she has any presence as one, so i'll continue with senpai. She might mindlessly consume trends like a soulless drone but she's not that bad, sure her passion pales when compared to mine but we all have to live for something! But if she's going to assume the cafe senpai certainly has a lot to work on, like for example: recognizing the talent of her employees and properly motivating them. It's very important"

"A lot of senpais are quite troublesome but Hina-chan is another level... She's always isolated and playing with her dolls so of course as a fellow student i couldn't leave her alone! Sure some people might find dolls of themselves "creepy", but doesn't it mean that someone appreciates you so much they want a little you to stare at forever?  But in the end our bond is quite fragile: i can't afford to forget my halo... if she does try to %darkred% defile %% my body with her eyes our relationship will meet a tragic end

"A shameless vapid slut whose sense of "fashion" is an assault against all that is decent. Why do we have to tolerate this repulsive sex pest?  Those who are into this disgusting gyaru without having their brains melted are the greatest waste of oxygen in this planet... Thankfully we don't have to see it during school, can you imagine having to share a classroom with this thing?"

>%fuchsia%Sezāru Ishiku%%
"César-kun isn't that far away from me in age but he looks so young it's hard not to mistake him with a kid.  He seems like a very polite and respectful boy with surprisingly good wifely skills, isn't it great to have a friend that can cook in the club? He does exaggerate a little with portions but if someone offers you a homemade meal you can only accept it right?"

"I've heard that Ama-nee is some college dropout loser but that couldn't be right, look at how young she is! On the other hand i've also heard she's always locked in that library of hers, so she's still a hikiNEET loser in the end. The library isn't half bad but if she wasn't a cavewoman and made a virtual version it would be much more convenient : All the forbidden knowledge easily accessible by one tap! And no risk of bumping into filthy gyarus too! 

"There isn't much to talk about paisen, she's about what you expect from a sloth sinner : Useless at pretty much everything only really showing any effort towards what she's passionate about, the privilege of not having to deal with the outside world... But outside of that and allowing certain bugs into her library she isn't that bad, maybe i should put some effort into finding those grimoires, seeing her struggle with technology is so cute!

>%aqua% Makoto Nagai / Yuki Kazama, The Place-Holder%%
"Macchan is dangerously cute for a guy. It would be quite unfair to compare him to me,  but for a boy it is impressive... Unfortunately his brain is beyond rotten.  Being pampered and praised without having to do anything is every girls dream but the way he's going is just shameful, he isn't going to get any kind of respectable boyfriend with that! And let's not forget rejecting a girl just because she wasn't rich, he's an enemy to all women!

"A cursed priest i've met while going to church. It's a bit unfortunate that he hasn't learned how to properly release his power level yet, you'd at least expect something like "Before me Raphael, behind me gabriel, at my right hand gabriel...." from a holy man don't you? I think he has noticed my cuteness but he's a bit too shy to recognize it."
