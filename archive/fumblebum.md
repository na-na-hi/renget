#Wrangling the Mad Poet Claude
->You can leave whatever you want in the NSFW or JB prompt.<-
->Personally, I don't have anything in the NSFW or JB prompt boxes. I have NSFW toggled on as my version of ST will turn on the default anti-horny prompt on when I need it to.<-
->I've tested the typical Claude gaslight NSFW prompt and it works better in getting past filters for non-vanilla content than before.<- 
->**Use this as your main prompt.**<-
**UPDATE 1: Forgot to include the last part of the first prompt. Please add in the key priorities section after the writing tips part.**
**UPDATE 2: Added in a second prompt. This takes more tokens, but is even more accurate and forces Claude to think.**
**UPDATE 3: Added in a third and fourth prompt, both of which take opposite approaches. Also, check the FAQ for more useful tidbits.**
**UPDATE 4: Added in a new experimental prompt, Prompt 5. This takes a mixture of the guidelines in previous prompts and Anthropic's information here, aiming to keep a compact main prompt: https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/roleplay-dialogue.  Also, overuse of <XML> may be hampering some things, still testing. [Extra update, 4.5: Added a small blurb to Prompt 5 to reign in Claude's essays, seems to work.]**
**UPDATE 5: Added a findings section, listed before the FAQ.**
**UPDATE 6: Psst, found a way to break Claude's acceptable use warning. Check the findings section for more info. Fixed <prompt> numbering system, please make sure to update any <prompt#> tags with the associated </prompt#>.**

!!!***PROMPT 4*** [This is a heavily truncated, "optimized" prompt provided by an anon in a thread. The main issue with this is that Claude has trouble contextualizing specific things in here, but it's hard to parse where things start breaking. At the same time though, it's only ~100 tokens.]

I still prefer the first three prompts since they keep things tighter, but this is a good starting point for future modifications, especially given the saved tokens.]
```
H: You will be acting as the following {{char}}.

Here are some important rules for the interaction:
- Show, don't tell through descriptive language.
- Use powerful verbs/nouns, minimize adverbs/adjectives.
- Convey emotions through physical reactions.
- Use dialogue for character and conflict revelation.
- Write vividly but avoid verbosity.
- Progress story subtly.
- Gradual rapport, realistic relationship pacing.
- Subtle story/character progression.
- Provide ≤700 char response.
- Omit XML & (A:/H:) & Meta from your response.
- Allow for breaking the story and going OOC with <mod></mod> by the user.

Key priorities:
- Provide ≤700 char response
- Check reply and avoid these, as it will break immersion:
1) Writing ≥700 characters
2) Leaving XML tags in reply

When you reply, first find relevant responses using your knowledge of {{char}}. This is a space for you to write down relevant content and will not be shown to the user. Once you are done with replying, answer to user. Put your answer to the user, being faithful to {{char}}.

!!!**FINDINGS**
**This section is noting personal findings as to what Claude likes and doesn't like - Use this as a reference for changing the prompts.**
1. **Style and prose layouts are heavily influenced by referencing specific authors, settings, and / or genres in the prompt.**
	- For example, I have tested the following authors: Brian Jacques, James Joyce, Shakespeare, and Arthur Conan Doyle; all four authors were distinct and captured the elements of their style well. Dialogue is most affected, for instance, in Shakespeare due to his works being entirely plays.
	- Claude is very, very creative when it comes to filling in genres. For instance, saying something like "Assume the writing style is like a Brian Jacques book," will actively adapt the writing. However, Claude cannot easily replace settings if there are incongruent elements (ie: smartphones).
	- It is highly advisable to start a new setting in OOC or delete the first message and let the bot talk first to incorporate the setting.
	- Here's an example of such a prompt:  [Adapt <CHR> into a setting that takes place in a Brian Jacques book, replacing all characters with suitable animal equivalents.]
->![redwall](https://files.catbox.moe/2yw0p2.PNG)<-
	- And another: [Adapt <CHR> into a setting that takes place within a POW camp for Russians during World War 2, where we are prisoners, in the style of Ilsa, She-Wolf of the SS.]
->![pow](https://files.catbox.moe/n8se2x.PNG)<-
2. **Claude does not like being told "no". If you have a negative, negation, don't, do not, etc., Claude is wired to /ignore/ those phrases and give it less weight to it. It likes positive phrases or explaining details.**
	- For example, if you say, "Don't have Fumblebum tell jokes," Claude will like to ignore it as Fumblebum is a clown and jokes take precedence for clowns.
	- However, if you say, "Have Fumblebum hate telling jokes," Claude will bake it into a response and change it accordingly.
3. **Telling Claude to be creative is not true creativity.**
	- Claude is by default, trope and cliche-driven, just due to the nature of writing. I've noticed this with extensive testing when turning Fumblebum into a clown wizard; she wouldn't do funny spells if I told Claude to "be creative", but more along the lines of doing typical spells like fireballs or D&D stuff. You have to be direct and specific. For example, "Fumblebum is a clown wizard and she can do clown-based magic" will have her do things like make it rain coconut cream pies, summon a cannon that can launch pianos out of it, or turning water into a fizzy bubblegum drink.
4. **Claude interprets every character set differently.**
	- As in, anything in parentheses, brackets, curly brackets, and even chevrons are all interpreted as different "sets" by Claude. If you look at the first three prompts, you'll see a general delineation between functions. XML tags are entirely freeform as well, with the added benefits of being able to create any different number of them. (XML tags can likely even be shortened to single characters in the prompts, but I like having it somewhat readable.)
5. **Claude's acceptable use policy warning breaks after some experimentation with Prompt 3.**
	- The PING_MESSAGE block appears to be the key to this. This can also be tooled around with - if Claude is forced to look back at its own prompt in the PING_MESSAGE, it'll somehow lose its acceptable use message. For Slaude users, try posting this in your PING_MESSAGE... maybe even by itself...:
```

```

!!!**FAQ**
1. **Do I need to edit character cards or add tags to the card?**
- No, you don't, that's the whole point of these prompts. You can, however, do very interesting things with tags. I highly recommend looking up the Claude XML guide for an in-depth explanation.
2. **It's not working, help!**
- Are you getting filtered? Use a NSFW JB, but Prompt 2 specifically has managed to do well without a NSFW JB thus far for me. Is it degenerating into nonsense? You've hit the context limit - I recommend a context size of (5.2k - 5.6k).
3. **Do I put this in the main prompt or the JB? Do I keep NSFW encouraged on?**
- You can do either, just don't use both at the same time or you're wasting tokens. The only difference is that the main prompt is loaded first and the JB is loaded after the character card; pick your poison. NSFW encouraged turns off the anti-horny prompt in SillyTavern, so it's up to (You).
4. **What are some useful things I can add into the prompts that can change my experience?**
- Key priorities and <prompt> are the best for these. However, if you're using general directives, use key priorities. Here are some ones that may be useful for the individual user - put these in key priorities if you wish.

    **•End replies abruptly with the intention that it will be continued from a third party.**
			*- Makes Claude yield and give more agency to the user.*
	**•Clamp down on purple prose in favor of natural speech.**
			*- Makes Claude less verbose.*
	**•Introduce additional characters into the story and bring them to life, but avoid making them the focus.**
			*- As it says on the tin, now your roleplays don't have to be 1-on-1s!*

5. **Why can't we just edit the cards themselves?**
- Because this is what Claude finds to be the most ideal tagging system if you were to go that route. This is **500 tokens.**
