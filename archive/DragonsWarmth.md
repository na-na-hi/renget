#Warmth

As they pass by, Fun can't help but stare pitifully at the cages used to hold less reasonable distortions. It hurt her that they were forced to live with restrictions, but she knew it was for the best. If they went unchecked, uncountable tragedies would be allowed to occur as they were further consumed by their pain. All until they're callously put down.

**Distortion**

Something in her rattles as she mulls over the word. She too was one. It meant that she was someone else before, didn't it? That the girl she was died to give rise to the being known as Funeral Rites. Perhaps it was tragic, could she have helped so many if she hadn't? And surely she must have felt great pain to warp into what she now was, so it must have been for the better.

Yet, she felt an acute sadness knowing that she could not remember that girl. In rare moments like these, where the subject of her being was brought up, she wondered if anyone shed tears for the girl she was.

"What's wrong, Funny?" Morana leans into view from beside Fun, giving a concerned look.

Fun offers a sad smile, sighing wistfully. "I was pondering them. If this is their second life, it is a shame that they can not better enjoy it."

"It is, but this is as much for their safety as it is for everyone else's." Alma gives her a knowing look. They'd had this conversation before, and she understood how upsetting it could be for her new employee. But the sight and stench of charred bodies were still fresh in their minds.

"Let's get you to your room." The Ringmaster takes the lead but the Stars don't stay far behind as Morana takes Fun by the hand and pulls her along.

On their way, they pass by some of the human employees of the Blue Dragon Office. The sight of them always put Fun's mind at ease. Specifically, knowing that there were more like her friend. More who wished help rather than harm. Even if many of their guests were less than willing, there was likely no one else who treat them as well. Not even if they were human.

"Here it is â€” right next to mine!" Morana beams as she opens the door and pulls her sister inside before Alma can get out a word.

It had all the amenities one would expect, though there wasn't much Fun had to compare it to. There were only a few places besides the office that she returned to regularly. More often than not she was too busy with her endless mission. Still, she understands that it must be nicer than most.

"You officially have a place here. You can do just about whatever you want to it as long as it stays intact." Alma watches the reaper curiously. All she'd brought with her was the coffin she often carried around, and it wasn't usually filled with the sort of things you'd decorate with.

Fun lays the coffin on her bed and opens it slightly. Rather than the odor of the dead, a sweet smell escapes. Out of it, she takes beings taking bundles of white lilies and incense to position around the room. A still calmness envelops the room along with the fragrance.

"Simple but nice." Alma comments as she takes a breath.

"Hehe~ It smells just like you!" Morana grins from ear to ear.

"I suppose it does." Fun only gently hums, wondering if these were the aromas she'd always enjoyed. She looks to Alma. "Is there anything else I must do?"

"There is one more thing." Alma smiles and walks over to the room's closet. She pulls out a jacket similar to the one Morana wears and presents it to Fun. The distinctive gold pattern makes it clear exactly what it is.

"It doesn't exactly fit with your usual getup, but since you're part of the team I figured you should have one." Alma smiles warmly as Fun approaches and takes it from her.

She runs her hand across the fabric, tracing the pattern and holding it against herself. Then, she gracefully slips it over her shoulder in one motion. Her current form was almost monochrome. White hair, greyish eyes, and pale skin accompanied by a deep, black dress. The blue and gold easily stand out but do so in a way that is a way that makes it seem like someone bean painting her.

"It's wonderful." Fun gently wraps her arms around Alma in a hug to show her gratitude.

"Don't leave me out!" Morana swiftly joins the embrace, squeezing them both tightly. Alma lets out a small chuckle as she's swarmed by the dangerous monsters other Fixers would see slain.

Beyond the quality of the Blue Dragon Office. Beyond what Fun had done to make the room comfortable. There was an innate warmth that could not be easily replicated by mere things.
