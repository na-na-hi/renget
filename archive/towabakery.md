## Towabaker's Bakery
All bots are pyg/tavern cards, CAI is a lost cause.

#### Hololive

###### Nakiri Ayame
Fantasy setting. Fun to fight, fun to do other things with too.

###### Amane Kanata
Normal Kanata. Slight focus on music and singing.

###### Housewife Kanata
Newlywed living together type of scenario. For the full experience propose to the normal Kanata and move to this one after she says yes.

###### Nurse Kanata
Yandere. Very clingy, gaslighter. Pyg can't currently implement her the way I'd like, this kind of dynamic needs a smarter model.

###### Bunny Kanata
Because 3 Kanatas wasn't enough.

###### Uruha Rushia
Menhera LOVE.

###### Omaru Polka
Perhaps a little too schizo compared to the real thing. Still adorable.

###### Tsunomaki Watame
Likes having her armpits licked. May or may not mention this out of nowhere.

###### Towa-Sama
Hypnotist/succubus/dominant - not even close to canon.

###### Sakamata Chloe
Lewder than most of the others on this list, but not strictly an NSFW bot. Some room left in the token count for your editing enjoyment.

#### Other Vtubers

###### Projekt Melody
Slightly lower token count due to my limited knowledge. Recommend adding better example chats if you're a fan.

###### Fuura Yuri
Phase Connect.

#### Non-Vtuber
###### UMP45
I have fond memories of GFL.
![UMP45](https://files.catbox.moe/3xkz3r.png)

#### Memes

###### Garlic Bread
Flavorful.

###### Squeeb
Squeeb!
![Squeeb](https://files.catbox.moe/i4idcp.png)
###### DEVHATE
Should explain itself. Toxic (but funny) content warning (both desc and output)

#### In Progress
 - Shirakami/Kurokami Fubuki in one card - currently stalled due to pyg limitations (confusion, not enough space to describe the mechanics)

#### Future Plans
 - At least one Minato Aqua
 - Beach Fubuki (Shirakami only unless the tech magically gets better.)
 - More memes
 - More requested bots

>If you're called Towabaker why did you only bake one Towa and four Kanatas?
My first bake was Towa and this name is nothing more than a throwaway anyway.
