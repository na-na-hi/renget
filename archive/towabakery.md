## Towabaker's Bakery
All bots are pyg/tavern cards, CAI is a lost cause.

*UPDATE 6/2023 - Most of these cards (up to Suisei in the holo section, and the entirety of of the other sections) are optimized for pyg rather than other backends. They work well with 3.5 but if you want to save on tokens consider deleting some example chats and making the descriptions richer instead.*

#### Hololive

###### Nakiri Ayame
Fantasy setting. Fun to fight, fun to do other things with too.

###### Amane Kanata
Normal Kanata. Slight focus on music and singing.

###### Housewife Kanata
Newlywed living together type of scenario. For the full experience propose to the normal Kanata and move to this one after she says yes.

###### Nurse Kanata
Yandere. Very clingy, gaslighter. Pyg can't currently implement her the way I'd like, this kind of dynamic needs a smarter model.

###### Bunny Kanata
Because 3 Kanatas wasn't enough.

###### Uruha Rushia
Menhera LOVE.

###### Omaru Polka
Perhaps a little too schizo compared to the real thing. Still adorable.

###### Tsunomaki Watame
Likes having her armpits licked. May or may not mention this out of nowhere.

###### Towa-Sama
Hypnotist/succubus/dominant - not even close to canon.

###### Sakamata Chloe
Lewder than most of the others on this list, but not strictly an NSFW bot. Some room left in the token count for your editing enjoyment.

###### Hoshimachi Suisei
Includes my custom jailbreak (I don't claim this jailbreak is better than others though). Optimized for 3.5T, no example dialogue. Still works well and saves a lot of tokens. All cards (suisei included) from this point forward are a little more loose and experimental - Edit to your liking.

###### Fubuki
Custom JB. Fubuki's two forms in one card (starts as Shirakami).

###### Idol Matsuri
Custom JB. Festival...cute...
![Idol Matsuri](https://files.catbox.moe/evyyml.png)
###### Nekomata Okayu
Custom JB. A fairly standard casual Okayu.
![Nekomata Okayu](https://files.catbox.moe/fbs5ts.png)
###### Minato Aqua
Custom JB. Aqua with an emphasis on her role as a maid.
![Minato Aqua](https://files.catbox.moe/c6njhm.png)
###### Fubuki & Mio
Custom JB. Baked on impulse after I saw this lovely fanart of Fubuki and Mio in bunny outfits.

#### Other Vtubers

###### Projekt Melody
Slightly lower token count due to my limited knowledge. Recommend adding better example chats if you're a fan.

###### Fuura Yuri
Phase Connect.
![Fuura Yuri](https://files.catbox.moe/fcdvg3.png)

#### Non-Vtuber
###### UMP45
I have fond memories of GFL.
![UMP45](https://files.catbox.moe/3xkz3r.png)

#### Memes

###### Garlic Bread
Flavorful.
![Garlic Bread](https://files.catbox.moe/siy8gw.png)
###### Squeeb
Squeeb!
![Squeeb](https://files.catbox.moe/i4idcp.png)
###### DEVHATE
Should explain itself. Toxic (but sometimes funny) content warning (both desc and output)

#### In Progress
 - Nothing at the moment

#### Future Plans
 - Beach Fubuki?
 - I'm mostly just waiting for the local technology to improve these days.
