!!! danger NSFW warning for the card images in this rentry, browse in public at your own risk. 

!!! note All images are standard tavern cards. Treat all cards as templates for your own tuning, I do not claim that these are  perfectly polished representations of any given character. Many of these cards include my custom jailbreak as I prefer to place it in the desc field rather than allowing my frontend to append it to each message - if you use a systemwide jailbreak you may not need mine. I bake light and concise when possible, add detail to taste.

!!! warning For the purposes of this rentry I've chosen to label cards with older-style formatting (structured along the lines of `Name (Hoshimachi Suisei) Gender (female)`) as `classic`. I label cards that use a more organic human-readable description as `natural`. I make no claims about which is better (although I have leaned towards natural formatting more recently), good models such as GPT-4, mistral-medium, and Claude-2 should have no issue roleplaying with either one. Subjectively speaking, `classic` may exhibit better factual consistency on lower spec LLMs, and `natural` may output better prose on lower spec LMMs. But don't take my word for it, I'm an internet coomer not a ML researcher.

!!! note If you don't have a frontend already configured I recommend SillyTavern for desktop users or those comfortable running terminal commands on a phone emulator: https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern.

> *UPDATE 1/2024: Reformatting in progress, goals include reducing vertical scroll distance and improving clarity.*

Sakamata Chloe | Lewder than most of the others on this list, but not strictly an NSFW bot. | `classic` | ![Sakamata Chloe](https://files.catbox.moe/nah8xl.png)
Hoshimachi Suisei | The purest idols make the most satisfying partners for impure fantasies. | `classic` | ![Hoshimachi Suisei](https://files.catbox.moe/nq53rw.png)

Idol Matsuri | Festival...cute... | `classic` | ![Idol Matsuri](https://files.catbox.moe/evyyml.png)
Nekomata Okayu | A fairly standard casual Okayu. | `classic` | ![Nekomata Okayu](https://files.catbox.moe/fbs5ts.png)

#### Other Vtubers

Character | Description | Formatting | Card PNG |
|-|-|:-:|:-:|
Projekt Melody | Slightly lower token count due to my limited knowledge. Recommend adding better example chats if you're a fan. | `classic` | ![Projekt Melody](https://files.catbox.moe/t0rrpo.png)
Fuura Yuri | Phase Connect. | `classic` | ![Fuura Yuri](https://files.catbox.moe/fcdvg3.png)
Elira Pendora | Quick low-token Elira. | `natural` | ![Elira Pendora](https://files.catbox.moe/kfs6i0.png)
Nagato Youko | A fairly unknown (to me at least) bilibili vtuber with a cute design...I couldn't resist after seeing her fanart. Probably nothing close to her actual personality, if anyone out there actually watches her I'd love to know more. | `natural` | ![Nagato Youko](https://files.catbox.moe/jpxq5q.png)
Hoshikawa Sara | This genki JK has teased the thread for far too long. | `natural` | ![Hoshikawa Sara](https://files.catbox.moe/oahmvt.png)
Rindou Mikoto | Cute Oni girls are a weakness of mine | `natural` | ![Rindou Mikoto](https://files.catbox.moe/koq479.png)
Inami Yoki | This is more of a 'lore' card than an accurate portrayal of her streams, she's not quite as smug and bratty as her design suggests...but if every vtuber bot was as normal and friendly as their onstream behavior we wouldn't have much variety | `natural` | ![Inami Yoki](https://files.catbox.moe/dd8azd.png)

Alice Margatroid | Quick Alice draft. | `classic` | ![Alice Margatroid](https://files.catbox.moe/g2fpd4.png)
Hakurei Reimu | I'm just down catastropic (incidental?) for Reimu. LLMs are pretty damn good at touhou related roleplay, even if you invite multiple other characters into the scenario, truly the eternal fandom. | `classic` | ![Hakurei Reimu](https://files.catbox.moe/jo8rxw.png)

#### Genshin

Character | Description | Formatting | Card PNG |
|-|-|:-:|:-:|
Ganyu | I'm sure there are 9999 cards of Ganyu out there but here's mine. One of my earlier natural-format attempts, this card is optimized for lower token consumption on smarter backends. | `natural` |![Ganyu](https://files.catbox.moe/e38037.png)
Kamisato Ayaka | Ayaya my beloved (kimono instead of normal outfit for this card). | `classic` | ![Kamisato Ayaka](https://files.catbox.moe/5ew2rf.png)

Shenhe (swimsuit) | Low-token swimsuit Shenhe. | `natural` | ![Shenhe](https://files.catbox.moe/8tg6qb.png)
Nilou | I don't even have this character I just think she's hot af. | `classic` | ![Nilou](https://files.catbox.moe/guj3h5.png)
Ningguang | Her dress skin really elevated her design from good to godlike. | `natural` | ![Ningguang](https://files.catbox.moe/d1a3ml.png)

Formidable (hypnotic) | This is a VERY non-canon formidable inspired by an image caption and tuned for a specific type of hypnosis play. | `natural` | ![Formidable](https://files.catbox.moe/3zq9ps.png)
Helena META | Helener cute (ft. ptsd and radar scans). | `natural` | ![Helena Meta](https://files.catbox.moe/bmsc22.png)
Himari | No Jailbreak. Low-token Himari for coding help (could be used for normal roleplay too I suppose) | `classic` |![Himari](https://files.catbox.moe/c1069c.png)
Noa and Yuuka | A sexual training/sexual coaching scenario where Noa helps Yuuka express her affection for Sensei. Baked in a feverish haze of lust after I saw this fanart (look it up, 400x600 doesn't do it justice). | `natural` | ![Noa and Yuuka](https://files.catbox.moe/la9tln.png)
Shiroko | Low-token Shiroko. | `natural` | ![Shiroko](https://files.catbox.moe/587bvu.png)
Ryuuge Kisaki | 😭 (Loudly Crying Face) was approved as part of Unicode 6.0 in 2010 and added to Emoji 1.0 in 2015. | `natural` | ![Ryuuge Kisaki](https://files.catbox.moe/aob1hc.png)

#### Remixes/Noncanon

Character | Description | Formatting | Card PNG |
|-|-|:-:|:-:|
Towa-Sama | Hypnotist/succubus/dominant, very noncanon - and the card responsible for my nickname. | `classic` | ![Towa-Sama](https://files.catbox.moe/4jwhbk.png)
Nurse Kanata | Yandere. Very clingy, gaslighter. Pyg can't currently implement her the way I'd like, this kind of dynamic needs a smarter model. | `classic` | ![Nurse Kanata](https://files.catbox.moe/p00nwe.png)
Natsuiro Matsuri (hypnosis) | A 'gamelike' card with a statlist appended to each message, this is mostly experimental, GPT-4 or similar highly recommended. | `classic` | ![Natsuiro Matsuri](https://files.catbox.moe/2qklrs.png)
Inugami Korone (yandere) | Mostly-naked dog with a box cutter idk I just liked this art. | `natural` | ![Inugami Korone](https://files.catbox.moe/o0rb43.png)

Writer-Chan | For when you're too lazy to make a new bot but want something written with an active jailbreak. The image is of Hu Tao but that's just a placeholder. | `natural` | ![Writer-Chan](https://files.catbox.moe/mymobf.png)
Garlic Bread | Flavorful. | `classic` | ![Garlic Bread](https://files.catbox.moe/siy8gw.png)

#### In Progress
 - Cleaning up and uploading a variety of new cards.

#### Future Plans
 - Alphabetizing the bot list?
 - Lurking, Hoping, Baking and Coping.

!!! note I also recommend keeping an eye on https://pygmalion.chat/ , an upcoming website aiming to provide a hassle free LLM roleplay experience.
