##### important

- the **edit code** is the **password** to access your rentry !

- if you forget or lose the edit code , there's [**no**](https://rentry.co/actuaIly) way to get your rentry **url** back ,
although you can copy and paste the published content into a **new** rentry

- it's best to **remember** the edit code ( memorize it , write it down , etc ) if you
have a particular url that you like .. as an example , I accidentally set the wrong
edit code for rentry.co/untarnished and I lost the url now grrrr >:(

##### markdown
- here is a compilation of **markdown** you can use in rentry !
>> [link]()⠀**. . .**⠀⠀\[text goes here](leave this empty unless you want to put a link to something)
>> **bold**⠀**. . .**⠀⠀\*\*text goes here\*\*
>> *italics*⠀**. . .**⠀⠀\*text goes here\*
>> ~~strikethrough~~⠀**. . .**⠀⠀~\~text goes here~~⠀**. . .**⠀⠀( remove the backslash )
> `codeblock`⠀**. . .**⠀⠀\`text goes here\`
> **`bold codeblock`**⠀**. . .**⠀⠀\*\*\`text goes here\`\*\*
> *`italic codeblock`*⠀**. . .**⠀⠀\*\`text goes here\`\*
>> ==highlight==⠀**. . .**⠀⠀\==text goes here==
>> ==`highlight and codeblock`==⠀**. . .**⠀⠀\==\`text goes here\`==
⠀
- extra markdown combinations for **links** !
>> [**bold**]()⠀**. . .**⠀⠀[\*\*text goes here\*\*\](link here)
>> [*italics*]()⠀**. . .**⠀⠀[\*text goes here\*\](link here)
>> [~~strikethrough~~]()⠀**. . .**⠀⠀[~\~text goes here~~\](link here)⠀**. . .**⠀⠀( remove the backslash )
> [`codeblock`]()⠀**. . .**⠀⠀[\`text goes here\`\](link here)
> [**`bold codeblock`**]()⠀**. . .**⠀⠀[\*\*\`text goes here\`\*\*\](link here)
> [*`italic codeblock`*]()⠀**. . .**⠀⠀[\*\`text goes here\`\*\](link here)
>> ==[highlight]()==⠀**. . .**⠀⠀\==[text goes here\](link here)==
>> [==highlight==]()⠀**. . .**⠀⠀[\==text goes here==\](link here)
>> [==`highlight and codeblock`==]()⠀**. . .**⠀⠀[\==\`text goes here\`\==\](link here)
⠀
**NOTE**
- to **stop** markdown from appearing , use this backslash \->⠀\
ex.⠀typing out⠀![backslash at the front of \*hi\*](https://i.postimg.cc/KzwMQDtT/image-25.png)⠀gives you⠀\*hi* , instead of making the text ![italic](https://i.postimg.cc/LXnPzbgR/image-26.png)

- you can also leave [\](**this**) area empty , so the text is just [blue]() for [decoration]() !
***

##### text alignment

- you can align text in rentry too !

⠀
\-> these arrows make your text appear in the **center** of the rentry <-

-> ==like this !== <-

⠀
\-> these arrows make your text appear at the **right** corner of the rentry ->

-> ==like this !== ->

⠀
**without** using these arrows , your text will automatically appear in the **left** corner of the rentry , ==like this sentence !==
***
***
##### images

- to add an image , type out *this* \!\[]([and add the image's link here]())

- to have a text description appear when the image is hovered over , add text in \!\[[these brackets]()](image's link goes here)

> EXAMPLE OF A TEXT DESCRIPTION ON AN IMAGE
- hover over the image below to see the description !

##### extra

- there are also more **colorful** dividers that you can put in your rentry !

>> DIFFERENT VARIATIONS INCLUDE
> \!!! info
> \!!! note
> \!!! warning
> \!!! danger

**EXAMPLE**

\!!! info This is a title !
`(press space four times here)`This is regular text ~

!!! info This is a title !
    This is regular text ~

\!!! info This is just a title !

!!! info This is just a title !

\!!! info
`(press space four times here)`This is just regular text !

!!! info
    This is just regular text !

- to make another type of divider in your rentry , you can type \*\*\* on a **separate line** where there isn't any text
- it creates a thin grey divider **like the one directly below** this text !

##### notice
this is not an **entirely** full guide to rentry , but rather a way to more
easily explain the main concepts to those who aren't familiar with it yet !

hopefully it was helpful for you, though ! ♡
