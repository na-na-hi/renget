##### `Quenching Her Thirst`
>You were with your gf Emma, preparing to do something kind of drastic
>she was a werewolf by birth and vampire through means unknown to you, however you knew she couldn’t turn you into one and that she didn’t like to talk about why she was one
>she had gone a few days without blood and couldn’t get any for a few more
>however she desperately needed some or she would starve unless she got some soon
>this was made worse by the fact the full moon was out and she had transformed into her werewolf form
>somehow you had managed to convince her to feed from you, even if it was extremely dangerous
>The towering she wolf was looking worse all the time and you knew she couldn’t wait any longer
>you sat down on the couch and presented your neck to Emma, her eyes glazing over in hunger for a split second

>Emma closed the distance between you almost instantaneously and sat down aswell
>she gently cradled your head with one claw and firmly held your shoulder with the other
>you heard her faintly muttering something about being sorry
>Emma bent her neck downwards and licked your own neck causing you to shudder
>suddenly you felt two sharp pains in your neck and you froze
>you wanted to scream but nothing came out
>your eyes tried to look at Emma’s face but the awkward angle you were at meant you could only see her closed eye
>and she was crying
>you didn’t know how long you had been being fed on but you started to feel disoriented, confused.
>soon after you felt cold, unusually cold
>your arms and hands managed to overcome the paralysis and felt for something to warm yourself up
>they found something that was fluffy and warm, but you couldn’t figure out what it was
>was that how disoriented you were? You couldn’t tell
>sleep, you could use a little sleep, it couldn’t hurt could it?
>you closed your eyes and fell unconscious

>who knows how long later you woke up
>you felt awful
>where were you?
>you looked around but were still slightly disoriented
>you were in your bed?
>you felt something warm and fluffy pressing into you from behind and shifted to look at what it was
>a bolt of panic shot through you for a split second as you saw 2 red glowing eyes staring at you a few inches away
>you realised it was Emma
>even in your current state you could tell she was looking much better
>”how are you feeling?” She whispered, hugging you closer to herself
>”Like shit-how did we get here?” You asked
>”I carried you up here after you passed out”
>oh yeah, she fed on you, you thought as you raised a hand to your neck, finding it covered in gauze and bandages
>”What, you think I’m just gonna leave you with 2 big holes in your neck?” Emma said, gently kissing your forehead
>probably inappropriately you said “how do I taste?”
>Emma didn’t say anything but started murmuring a string of continuous sorry’s
>shushed her and the she wolf looked like she was on the verge of tears
>”could you help me warm up, I feel like an icebox” you said trying to distract her
>Emma pulled you in even closer causing you to get a face full of boob
>you started to fall back to sleep but not before hearing Emma whisper
>”when you’re feeling better how about I give you a different kind of sucking?”
>you could sense the smirk at the end of that.
