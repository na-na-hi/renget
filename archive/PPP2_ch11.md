#### Customizing Input and Output
>*“Keep it simple: as simple as possible, but no simpler.”* —Albert Einstein

*"In this chapter, we concentrate on how to adapt the general iostream framework presented in Chapter 10 to specific needs and tastes. This involves a lot of messy details dictated by human sensibilities to what they read and also practical constraints on the uses of files. The final example shows the design of an input stream for which you can specify the set of separators."*
