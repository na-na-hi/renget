>You were tired. 
>Work had run long, too long. 
>Stress and Obligation were weighing you down
>The walk back home passes agonizingly slow. 
>City Noise. Flashing Lights. Cold Air.
>All of it was wearing you down. Your body, your mind, your soul.
>Like the waves of the sea wearing down rocks to sand.
>The door to your shared apartment was like seeing a campfire.
>You open it, the smell of freshly cooked food hits you instantly. 
>Lui was setting the table, hamburg steak, vegetables, tofu, and rice.
>She stops as she hears the door and she turns to you.
>Your eyes lock with Lui's.
>It doesn't take long before she understands. 
>Her hand grabs yours, as she guides you to the couch. 
>She sits down and pats her lap, the invitation clear.
>You rest your heavy head on her lap. Soft but firm. Warm in a way that was more than physical.
>Lui stares at you, her hand going through your hair with practiced grace. 
>She says words of encouragement, of care but it didn't matter to you.
>The warmth from her body and from her words melt into you. 
>All that frustration, anxiety, bitterness. All the pains of the day 
>All of it was nothing to this. 
>The warmth of her presence and care was all you needed.
>You wake up feeling the weight of the VR headset on your face.
>You unlock it off your face, as you stand up.
>These VR scenarios were getting realistic, too realistic.
>It was almost scary how real it felt.
>Your phone vibrates. An Incoming Call.
"Did you like it?"
>Lui's voice said through the phone
"I made it for you"
>Your hands trembled.
"Sorry I couldn't do it personally."
>What.
