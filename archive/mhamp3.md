# Prompts
####Social Media Presence
Does your MHA have a social media presence?
Is it their real name, or their cape name, or do they have both?
What do they post? Who do they follow?
Have you been a good hero today?
####How do you feel about your quirk?
How do you feel about your quirk, fellow... uh... [name pending]?
Is this what elevates you above the rest of the bozos? Is it a curse you wish you never had? Is it just a tool you happen to own?
If you had the chance, would you trade your quirk in for another random one?
####Acts of Heroism / Favorite Pro Hero / Thoughts on Potential
What deeds of 'heroism' have you done lately that you want Senpai to praise you for?
Who is your favorite Pro Hero?
Who do you think has the most potential, good or evil, among our up and comers?
What's your favorite snack?
Do you jaywalk?
####Ultimate Moves / Gadgets / Willpower/ Night Parade
Have you done anything to help others today?
What's your ultimate move called, what's it do? Have you used it before? Did it work or fail spectacularly?
Do you plan to commission any tools or gadgets when you get the funds? If so who from?
Do you have exceptional Willpower?
What are your thoughts on the Night Parade?
####Internship Ideas / Villains Hanging Out / Supporter Investments
> Students
Which of the Pro Hero PCs would your character most want to intern under (I'll even let you pick a teacher if you want since there's not many choices otherwise)? Which would you personally want your character to intern under?

>Heroes
Which Hero Student would your character want to intern under them the most? Which would you personally want to intern under your character?

>Villains
Who would your character want to hang out with if you weren't at risk of getting arrested (like if you were suddenly pardoned of all of your crimes)?

>Supporters
Who does your character have their eye on in terms of business opportunities?
####What kind of Hero you want to be / Your biggest moment / Prison Break / Your greatest desire / Coffee
>Students
What kind of hero do you want to become? When you save the day, what do you want the civvies to think? Do you want admiration? Reverence? Do you want them to get hyped up about your existence or do you want to be a calming presence?

>Heroes
Your biggest crime-busting or people-saving moment. The kind of thing where you get a newspaper of that day and frame it in your office. What was yours? Or, if you haven’t had one of those moments yet, what would you want it to be? Stopping a giant underground crime ring? Rescuing a hundred civilians from a burning building?
And piggybacking off of the Students’ question… what kind of hero are you?

>Villains
You got got, and you’re in jail now. Luckily, they’ve got you stuck in a normal holding cell for now, no considerations for your quirk, the idiots (if you’re an S-rank threat they’re prepping you for transfer to Tartarus). Still, there’s guards and bars. It might not be looking good… but no great villain is without at least a dozen escape plans. How are you getting out? Outside help, or just yourself?

>Supporters
Heroes and Villains… they’re ambitious by nature. They want to be number one. They want fortune and fame… but Supporters don’t necessarily need to want those things. So tell me, what is your greatest desire? Maybe you want a quiet life where you do your job, go home to a family, and enjoy peaceful days. Maybe you’ve got your sights set higher, and you want your face known around the world, as much as any big hero or villain. Or maybe you’re just happy with the day by day.
What do you want most out of life?

>Everyone!
What kinda coffee do you like? Doin’ some market research, gotta stay ahead of the competition.
####Home Base
Let's talk residencies and bases of operation. What does yours look like? How is it decorated? For most folk this could be their actual house or apartment, but for the heroes who run their own agencies it could be their office building, or a villain's secret hideout, a supporter's workshop, etc. What's yours like right now?
What would you want it to be like? 
####Hobbies
You got hobbies outside of doing school/heroics/villainy/whatever? We can't be all business, all the time, right? What do you do for fun?
####Biggest Personality Flaw
What do you think your biggest flaw is?
Not in terms of strength, but in personality.
Where do you fall short as a person?
####Biggest Personality Strength
We've learned your flaws and your fears. Now I wanna see some big egos. What's your greatest strength?
Personality-wise, that is. 
####Hidden Talents
What are your hidden talents? Things that people wouldn't expect you to be talented at, but you are. Maybe you're secretly a good singer, or a great chef? Could be anything.
####Misc. Sports Festival Questions
What are you going to be up to during the Shiketsu sports festival? Will you be attending, and if so, for what reason?
>Students
Who do you think is your biggest threat to winning the festival? Any plans on how to take them out? Maybe you're hoping to eliminate them on an earlier round, or maybe you've got a "surefire" strategy for the duels.
>Pro Heroes
Which young hero do you think is worth keeping an eye on? Anyone you're interested in taking as an intern?
>Villains
Are you going to show up to probe for the Next Generation's weaknesses, or are you going to be taking the opportunity to do a little tomfoolery while the heroes aren't as alert? Or maybe you just like watching the festival. I don't judge.
####Most Significant Person in Your Past
Aside from family or friends, what person would you say has positively impacted your life the most? It could be your idol who you strive to follow, or it might be some random guy you never got the name of who gave you some sagely advice. Could be anything, really.
####Prized Possession
What would you say is your most prized possession? Is it a keepsake from your family? A gift from a first friend? A weapon that's carried you through all your dangerous situations?
####Regrets
It's natural to regret things in your life. Whether it's something big like never being able to make amends with a family member, or something tiny like selling a collector's item right before it skyrocketed in value, we've all got things we wish we could do better.
So a 2-for-1 today, friends. What is your biggest regret, and what's a really trivial one you still think about?
####Blowing Off Steam
Something's got you mad. Maybe it was a lot of little things building up throughout the day or it's something you brought on yourself, but the important thing is that this isn't something physical you can punch in the face to make go away.
So how do you blow off steam? Do you break things? Channel your seethe into something productive? Relax with a game?
####Happiest Memory
What is your happiest memory? A single moment you remember to this day, that reminds you of good times (whether that makes you feel better or worse about where you're at now).
Maybe it's a crowning accomplishment, or maybe it was just hanging out with some friends you don't keep up with anymore, or getting to meet your idol.
####Your Hero/Villain Name
How did you come up with your hero name? Is it something that is deeply personal to you or is it something that you could care less about. Would you ever want to change it if you had the opportunity?
####Guilty Pleasures
We all have guilty pleasures that we indulge in from time to time, whether it be food, activities, or something else. What's yours? Maybe you like to sneak out to concerts for some embarrassing band, or you like trashy romance novels, or you eat ice cream right out of the carton.
####/tg/
Does your character play /tg/? It can be a trpg, a tcg, or even a board game. What's your character's poison if any?
####Clubs
Do you participate in any clubs, and if so, how do you feel about how they are run?
Graduates in the extended cast, (are there any?) feel free to answer if you feel you made history or reputation that might have lingered.
####Favorite Place
Aside from the obvious answer of "your home," what's your favorite place to go? Whether to calm yourself down or cheer yourself up, what's a place you find yourself returning to often to feel better?
It could be a cliff with a nice view, an arcade where you hold the high score on the dance game, or that restaurant with great sushi. 
####Lottery
You've won the lottery! Whether you bought a ticket on the whim, found it on the ground, or just have a crippling addiction to scratch cards, you've found yourself in possession of a large (yet finite) sum of money.
What are you doin' with it?
####Parental Warmth
How's your relationship with your parents, both right now and when you were younger? How did they raise you?

If they're dead, do you have any unresolved regrets involving them? An argument that never got cleared up, some decision of yours they never approved of, stuff like that. 
####Parents' Quirk/Quirk Origin
What were your parents' quirks? It's always interesting to me to see how quirks would combine.

And since that isn't really enough for a prompt on it's own, another question.
How and when did your quirk first come in? What did you (and your family/friends) think of it at the time? Is that different from how you feel now?
####Greatest Fear
What is something you're especially afraid of? Is it an irrationally fear of bugs? Is it a hero or villain that you're terrified of? It might be something that you're scared of losing. Something in your past resurfacing to shatter your life.

How would you react if you came face-to-face with that fear right now? Do you cower and lose yourself in despair, flee from the problem, or rise above it and come out better?
####Would You Change Your Quirk?
To all students, heroes and villains, if you could change one thing about your quirk what would it be?

If you could choose the quirk of another character over your own, who's quirk would you take? Provided you know everything about their quirk. After a 30-day trial, would you want to switch back or keep the new quirk? 
####How to get you mad
What's the fastest way for someone to get on your bad side with minimal effort? Do you really hate people who move your stuff without telling you, hate having your parents insulted, something else?
How do you deal with people who do those things?

How much would someone have to do for you to actually see them as an enemy, rather than just "someone you don't like"? Short of straight up doing criminal acts to you, that is. 
####Motivation/Goals?
What's your motivation to do what you do? Why do you want whatever your goal is? (For example if you wanted to become the Number 1 hero, why? Would being Number 1 let you do something that you couldn't otherwise, or is it just a simple drive to be the best)
When your back's up against the wall, what do you think of to drive yourself forward? 
####How to get on your good side?
Opposite of the prompt from two threads back which is missing from this prompt comp, what small things do people do that make you think of them more favorably?
What would you say is the easiest way for someone to become your friend?
####Most effective insult against you
What’s the absolute cruelest, most character-destroying thing someone could say to you? The kind of thing where, however you brush it off (because we wouldn’t be great heroes or villains if some words were all it took to take us down), it’ll stay in your mind for a long, long time afterwards. The words that draw on your deepest fears and insecurities and use them as fuel for a precise verbal annihilation.
####Fighting Style
MHA, what is your go-to strategy in battle? Against multiple foes? Against one big powerful enemy?

Switching it up, what is your go-to move when you want to befriend someone? Do you talk their ear off in class? Do you bring them gifts? Stalk them until they relent? 
#### Traditions and Rituals / Missionary at your front door
https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/thread/88703429/#88704097
For MHA, do you have a tradition or ritual that you observe? Like washing your hands for 20 minutes after a fight. Or visiting your parents each month? Maybe you migrate south every winter (birds)?

Bonus question, what would you do if a Mormon-like missionary rang your doorbell?
#### Different Career Path / Motivation
https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/thread/88732116/#88732716
If your current career path doesn't work out, what other profession would you be interested in? Assuming you had the resources to pursue it. Do you fall back in with your family's business? Or would you rather be a hobo living under a bridge?

Name one or two things that motivates you daily. Perhaps it's your desire to leave crushing poverty? Do you have something to prove? Or is there someone special that keeps you going?
#### Student Rival / Pro School Days / Villain Education / >>>Supporter
https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/thread/88742264/#88743403
For the students who took rival, who do you think is the best fit, narratively?

For pros, how did you act during your school days? Were you a delinquent? Model student? Recommended?

For villains, how educated are you? Did you finish high school? College?
#### Baggage / Not-obvious Side-effects
https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/thread/88748106/#88751554
What do you carry with you all the time? What's in your pockets / bag?

What are some not-so-obvious side-effects of your quirk? Do you buy specific clothing, or consume more calories than average? Have you never gotten sick? Maybe you used to be fat, because your quirk just moved things for you?
#### Team-up / New Strategy or Skill (NO RESPONSES)
https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/thread/88756350/#88758110
If you were assigned to a team-up for a mission/patrol, what kind of teammates would you want to work with? What would make you leave a team-up?

Do you have a new strategy or skill that you've been training? Maybe it's something that you've been thinking about and haven't yet developed? Perhaps it's done and you're saving it as an ace for when things get heavy.
#### Party / Superstition
https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/thread/88771802/#88772268
You're at a big party, what are you doing?

How superstitious are you?
#### Drunk
https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/thread/88781907/#88783676
How does your MHA act when they're drunk?
#### Food
https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/thread/88799147/#88804898
How does your character cook their steak? Are they a picky eater in general, or are they a human garbage disposal?
#### Diary
https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/thread/88828941/#88829329
Does your character keep a diary? Whether they do or not, what kind of stuff would they write in it? Asking for a friend.
#### Typical Schedule
https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/thread/88828941/#88830444
What does your character do in a typical day? From waking up to going to bed, they don't just go to class/patrol/do villainy/vigilantism for the 16-18 hours they're awake, do they? How is their day broken up?
#### Lost Quirk
https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/thread/88835381/#88835490
Heros/villains/vigilantes/quirked up people - let's say that your character permanently loses their quirk/mutation(s).

What are they feasibly going to do for the rest of their natural life? Still fight crime? Still commit crime? Fall back into a profession and just do their best that way? Become a quirkless hero supporter? Enter a state of despair or desperation and spend the rest of their life trying to find a method to regain their quirk? Become NEETs?
#### Favorite Media Genre
https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/thread/88843859/#88844324
Heroes/villains/vigilantes/students, what is your character's favorite genre of movie/show/anime?
#### Meteor
https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/thread/88852542/#88854350
Heroes, villains, vigilantes, students, supporters. A world-renowned clairvoyant with an accuracy rate of 80% has just dourly announced that in a week a large meteor will make impact with Earth and end all life as we know it...

How does your character react to this news? How do they carry themselves for the duration of this week before doomsday? Do they make amends with those they've hurt? Who do they spend the most time with? Do they go all out on eating, drinking, drugging, and generally imbibing in all kinds of things? Do they try to clean up their act for what it's worth? Do they call BS on the announcement, banking on the clairvoyant's 20% inaccuracy and keep living life as usual? Make confessions? Try to keep up the justice system as the world spirals into chaos? Turn to doing crime or doing even more crime than before?
#### Historical Figure
https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/thread/88858446/#88863328
Heroes/villains/vigilantes/revolutionaries/teachers/supporters/students, if your character had the chance to meet and speak with one historical figure, who would it be? A famous fashion designer, like Cristobal Balenciaga? A political figure like Teddy Roosevelt? Mansa Musa? Musashi Miyamoto? Sun Tzu? Julius Caesar? Annie Oakley?
#### Pizza
https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/thread/88867906/#88868458
Favorite pizza topping(s)? Express your favorite crust, cheese, and even sauce customizations as you please, but everyone loves pizza.
#### Motto
https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/thread/88867906/#88868458
What’s your motto? You have one, right?
#### Streetfood
https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/thread/88883405/#88883466
Whats your characters favorite street food?
#### Camping and Survival
https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/thread/88902574/#88904744
We've been to parties and the beach but, how are you at camping? How would you handle a camping trip with others? Are you completely out of your element in the wilderness? Or are you confident in your outdoor survival skills? You'd need a way to deal with all the bugs and bears in the woods. Perhaps you're an avid visitor of Japan's many scenic camping grounds, or are you the type to die in three days without the loving embrace of modern civilization?
#### Map
https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/thread/88921394/#88922258
What is the area around your house is like? What kind of neighborhood do you live in? Do you know your neighbors? Is there someone taking your fucking newspaper? 
#### Ringtone
https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/thread/88941494/#88943516
What's your character's ringtone? Do you have unique ones for specific people? 
#### Pain Pain Go Away
https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/thread/88955419/#88955575
How do you make the pain go away?
#### Birthday
https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/thread/88955419/#88966142
What do you usually do on your birthdays?
#### Internship 2
https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/thread/88994843/#q88995170
Pro Heroes, Students. It's been a while since we discussed internships, and the narrative landscape has changed a ton. So let's explore that again. If you're a Pro Hero, who would you want to bring under your wing? If you're a student, who would you like to learn from?
For any supporters still around, do you feel like any of the other builds wasted their potential and should have been a supporter like you?
For villains, is there anyone you'd like to corrupt/save, such that they see the world the way you do? 
#### Trip
https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/thread/89025897/#89028233
If you were voted in to choose a location, and could take your team/class to a field trip where would you go? Would you show-off something personal to you like your hometown? Would you take them somewhere for training or education? Maybe they could just chill in your basement?

If you're a loner, what new place have you always wanted to visit? 
#### Worst Deed
https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/thread/89049516/#89050388
What is the worst thing your build has ever done? Did you ruin someone's life, or maybe you stole something.
#### Saturday Night Drink
https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/thread/89076711/#89087246
It’s Saturday night. What’s in your glass? 
#### Maid/Butler
https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/thread/89091881/#89097060
How would you do as a maid/butler?
Would you be seen and not heard?
Or lively and hardworking?
Or would be a walking disaster? 
+as a bonus question, who is your master if you're a butler/maid? It can be any other build in the mp. 
#### Favorite Food
https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/thread/89103983/#89104579
Heroes, villains, and everyone in between, what’s your favorite food?
#### Voice and Karaoke
https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/thread/89126571/#89128087
What do you imagine your build's voice sounds like? How good are they at karaoke? 
#### Children
https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/thread/89193014/#89193540
How would your character intend to raise any potential child of theirs? How tolerant will they be of their kid(‘s/s’) personal decisions? What kind of politics and virtues will they try to instill into them? Will they raise their child(ren) based on their sex/gender? How strict or lenient will they be with them? Any career path they’re going to force them into? Or perhaps they’ll be absent/deadbeat parents to them? 
#### Change Policy
https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/thread/89236783/#89240948
Your character has just been placed in an incredibly privileged position. They are allowed to alter, remove, or add any ONE (1) policy/law in Japan. The government and law enforcement will do its utmost best with its available resources to meet the requirements that your character desires with the removal/addition/change of a law. Everyone is expected to follow it, unless you desire it to only be followed by a select demographic, and you can have there be a fine or even jail time for not adhering to it. Women are required to wear all pink on Friday, else be fined 10,000 yen? This can be done. All guns are now legal, and require no permit? Done. Nationally-mandated Hinduism that everyone has to follow? Done. (Dissenters will exist, of course)

What’ll it be? 
#### Merchandise
https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/thread/89236783/#89238426
What kind of merchandise would you want made to promote yourself?
#### Quirk Training
https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/thread/89250887/#89251745
Students/Heroes/Villains/Supporters, how do you train your quirk? Do you use any gadgets or tools to help you train? Is there a theory behind your training, like how someone who sweats nitroglycerin might try to get their pores to open up?
Always remember that quirks are a part of your body! They get stronger with constant training and get weaker if you don't use them for a while.

How do you stay on top of your quirk training?

# Hero Students
##Former 1-D
###Victor Sigurd HN "HYDRA"
1.
>Does your MHA have a social media presence?
Absolutely none. He sees it as a glaring weakness in terms of information security.
2.
>How do you feel about your quirk?
There is some emotional conflict here for Victor. On one hand he is happy to exist as he is, to be alive, and to have a great deal of power. To an extent he is even grateful to the scientists who ‘made’ him, more so at least than the donors (sperm, egg and stem cells) he was made from. On the other hand, the influence of living in a governmental ‘quirk testing’ facility has left its mark on his psyche. He equates the power of his quirk with his personal worth, and deep down considers himself to be a human weapon. These feelings were also enforced to a certain extent being raised by a military professional, who drilled in ‘fire discipline’ regarding his dangers of his quirk from a young age. 
3.
>What deeds of 'heroism' have you done lately that you want Senpai to praise you for? 
Back in NZ, near completely reversed flooding in a localised area of the South Island, saved several lives and many livestock.
>Who is your favorite Pro Hero?
Rumi Usagiyama. Sex.
>Who do you think has the most potential, good or evil, among our up and comers?
Anyone can apply their abilities to the greater good. For evil, anyone with a quirk that influences the mind has the oppotunity for horrifically evil acts.
>What's your favorite snack?
Fish sushi. Any type.
>Do you jaywalk?
No, never.

###Genma Gō HN "Kinji"

##Freshmen
###Damien Jackson - HN "Dark Seer"
7.
For Damien it is a low end apartment. Just enough space for a futon, a tiny kitchen, and a bathroom. There are no decorations and you barely have room to move around 
###Johnny Walker HN "Titan"

## Sophomores
###Mochi Uranus HN "Smelly Hero, Stink Rat"
1.
>Does your MHA have a social media presence?
Yes.
>Is it their real name, or their cape name, or do they have both?
Stink Rat has a personal account linked to his hero persona and also manages the school newspaper website and socials.
>What do they post? Who do they follow?
On the newspaper account: Announcements for new releases, school events, etc.
On personal: He follows several manga artists and shills his grandma's bakery.
>Have you been a good hero today?
Yes, he made it smell nice for several people in passing.
2.
>How do you feel about your quirk, fellow... uh... name pending?
>Is this what elevates you above the rest of the bozos? Is it a curse you wish you never had? Is it just a tool you happen to own?
When he was younger, Mochi was bullied for his lame quirk. He felt helpless when his parents got collateraled in a hero-villain fight, which is why he registered to train as a hero and learn how to use his quirk to do something useful.
>If you had the chance, would you trade your quirk in for another random one?
He would be tempted, but worry that he'd just roll an even worse one on the quirk gacha.
5.
Out on assignment, Stink Rat has already worked with Rosethorn a few times. If he were gunning for an internship, he would specifically request Popsy the Clown. When he was growing up she was still in her prime, and watching her on news reports turning villains into a joke with her comedy powers made the world feel a lot less bleak when he was being bullied. Seeing how far his hero has fallen hasn't been great for his outlook on life.

###Kevin Rool
###Hiroki Asai HN "Champion of Negativity: Zetsuboy"

## Seniors
###William "Billy" Dustice HN "King Billy"
4.
>Have you done anything to help others?
Gave a freshman some advice. Gave him some money, too, 'cuz uh, someone stole his snack. Yeah.
>What is your ultimate move called?
It's called "letting loose." You gotta try it sometime, koh.
>Do you plan on commissioning any tools or gadgets when you get the funds?
Bag of snacks. Big one, yeah? Somethin' to keep around when I get hungry after a scrap. Big bag of... fruit snacks, yeah. Keheheh.
>Do you have exceptional willpower?
Koh, I dunno. You gotta willpower detector on you?
>What are your thoughts on Night Parade.
Hope they got health insurance.
18.
an obvious reference to the monkey king of mythological fame. the name itself was thrust onto billy by his peers after his fight, and he decided to roll with it as a hero name because it is fundamentally who he is. there's no point in trying to hide his identity-- it's not like there are any other six-foot hairy ape-men walking around japan.

a meta answer-- it's also a reference to Kings of Nowhere, the comic series that billy's art is from.
24.
billy actually has a pretty positive relationship with his parents. they're pretty much the only thing he cares about and they're the sole reason he's even in japan in the first place. you can catch him sitting around on rooftops away from prying eyes, reading postcards from back home. sincerely talking shit about billy's mom is a pretty instant route to getting your face and limbs ripped off chimp-style
25.
both of them are primate-themed mutant types, but neither to the same degree as billy. they look a lot like saiyans (no relation to kaylee or jugo), well-built folks with long monkey tails and sharp fangs, but otherwise humanoid. his mom a little more macaque-like - slender, agile, tricksy. his dad inherited more great ape traits and is bulkier, top-heavy, and doesn't have a tail.

billy's a mutant-type so he's had his quirk since the moment he was conceived. imagine being a mother and pushing out a literal fucking baby chimpanzee and you can guess how they felt about it. he got plenty of shit for it in school but now it's just who he is. he's embraced the "monkey king" aesthetic wholeheartedly. 
34.
well, barista work with some crimefighting on the side works fine.
39.
billy's probably as quiet drunk as he is sober. he'd probably just sit and relax, enjoying the company of others. like that one gif of the monkey staring at the sunset with a nonplussed expression, the hairs on his face slightly twitching with the wind.

though sometimes he gets a little too worked up and uh
44.
billy grew up poor, so as a kid, he mostly consumed the same media his parents did when they grew up - whatever DVDs they had lying around plus the cheap stuff that his dad could rent from the movie store for chump change. as such, billy's inherited his dad's love for vintage martial arts flicks. the cheesier and crustier it looks, the better. now that he's older and an actual martial artist, he can't appreciate an action movie without fights that feel physical and "solid."

it could be why he's so sympathetic towards quirkless kids. he grew up idolizing the bare-handed battle between powerless fighters, with their quirks having no bearing on how they match up, so all that remains is a contest of skill, experience, and grit.

then again, he also grew up watching anime into the late 90s and early 2000s. especially the super violent stuff that he really wasn't old enough to have been watching at the time. he'll never admit it but most of his style in his early school years was because he was trying to be as cool as spike spiegel.

>Does your MHA have a social media presence?
Yea, @WeissSchwarz on herogram.
>Is it their real name, or their cape name, or do they have both?
She also has a private account with a fake name, but sometimes forgets to switch and ends up liking some awkward content on her Weiss Schwarz account.
>What do they post? 
In the past she posted some DIY clips on maintaining and customizing hero gadgets with a handpuppet that she animated using her quirk (pretty much a glove with googly eyes glued on), but recently she didn't have so much time for that anymore..
>Who do they follow?
Despite of course making sure she undid all her likes, she has yet to realize that her Weiss Schwarz account still follows an artist with some choice instant loss art.
Also accounts in and around Shiketsu High School.
>Have you been a good hero today?
"I did... my besht...!" - Johanna after it finally set in that she has to move to Japan because of what later would commonly be referred to as 'the incident'. 

###Mio Katsushi HN "Forget-Me-Not"
https://rentry.org/nmnmk
41.
A detailed record of Mio's daily schedule with her most secluded moments highlighted in green
43.
For Mio, losing her quirk would be a certifiable "Code Red" moment. She'd be so relieved that she has all her blackmail backed up onto physical hard drives, but her life would be going into a very different direction. Finish high school and then go to college. Earn some degrees and get a great job because of her tech savviness. But she'd be so fucking BORED. She'd of course try her little schtick a few more times against lower risk targets and have it blow up in her face a few times. Then she'd be forced to find a healthier outlet for her sadistic tendencies, and likely would be a better person overall in the end because of it.
44.
Mio used to be the type to absorb whatever was popular at the time so that she could chat about it with her friends. However, as of recent years, that's changed a lot. Mentioned slightly in my prompt catchup, but Mio is head editor in whatever the school's equivalent of the A/V Club is. Whatever kind of production crew the school has to record things like important sport games or school plays. She is now much more critical about cinematic principals and techniques and has a difficult time watching movies and live action shows with poor filming. Once she pulled back the veneer of how movies are made and gotten into the nitty gritty of it, it's been impossible to not see it in everything she watched. It's not out of character for her to groan about things like headroom and awkward camera movements out loud during a movie.
45.
Whether this the meteor is real or not, this is a worst case situation for Mio. She wouldn't believe everyone was going to die from a meteor, but she knows that enough people will believe it that she will absolutely not be safe. Whether it's people looting and rioting, villains no longer afraid of getting arrested, or one of the many people she's scorned over the years, someone is going to try to hurt her, kill her, or worse. For the next week, she would be bunkering down in a little private space she's prepared for herself. She'll come back when it's proven that the meteor is a hoax. If it isn't a hoax, then she'll be dead anyway, so who cares?

Ashleigh and dad can come too I guess...
47.
Pizza isn't really one of Mio's favorite foods. It's usually too greasy for her. But when the mood strikes her or if dad is getting pizza anyway and asks what she wants, her usual go to choice is potato mayonnaise. Thin crust, normal cheese, normal sauce. About a 50/50 chance she'll want corn on it too.
48.
Fuck it We Ball
50.
Mio would be the first person to die in a wilderness survival scenario. The most she has is info from stuff like Wiki binges, but the moment she faces a wild animal like a bear, it would not come to mind. Her main strategy would be try to hide asap and erase herself from the animal's memories. Even then, that doesn't hide stuff like her smell or the sounds she makes, so she'd be doomed without a doubt.

Assuming she was forced on a camping trip, she'd be bitching the entire time. Stuff about how the wilderness sucks and what she'd rather be doing in civilization at that moment. Complaining about bugs and the cold/heat. Just a whiny baby throughout.
52.
Mio likes to make remixes of songs in her spare time as a hobby, so I'd imagine that her ringtone is on rotation to whatever her most recently made one is. That or she just makes her own.
59.
A maid should be hardworking! If I were hired as a maid for whatever reason, then of course the house would be cleaned up every day. What good is a maid that can't do their job properly? Most cleaning should be done before the master gets out of bed and starts their day so that I can be attended to whenever I need it. I'll be performing random inspections, so stay alert! Now, please go get me a cup of tea and a new outfit. This outfit really doesn't suit me. Hurry up, you don't want to make a bad showing on your first day as my new maid, right? Right! 
65.
Oh, you know... normal stuff! Don't worry about it too much.

###Aiko Ami HN "Rosethorn, The Motivational Hero" (TEACHER)
24.
Rosethorn had a cushy life to the point her parents didn't want her to be a hero. They wanted her to stay with he family and run the business then settle down and have kids like a normal person.

Her teen years were particularly rebellious, leading both to a gap between them and her hero training. She didn't return until after she was officially a hero - and then in pretty bad terms since she wasn't a high ranking hero and had gotten burned quite bad and was unable to take care of herself. They still took care of her, and as she recovered they reconciled their different points of view, and the straw that broke the camels back on their resistance was a letter from the mother of a child she had saved from the flaming villain who made them remember their love for their own kid.

The father passed away from work related stress eventually, but the mother is still around and looks good for her age. A few of the more ambitious simps have even tried to meet her and flirt, leading to them finding out that her quirk turns her into a raging beast whenever she gets too angry - and no amount of anger management classes can suppress the rage she feels about someone thinking she would cheat on her deceased husband. 
32.
Power up self and any allies is first priority, debuff enemies is second priority. Context really matters though. Most big bois are worth dipping into Stockpile to weaken them even more which puts a hard limit on how long the fight can last before shes useless since she has to pay it back with interest when her power wears off rather than the usual mostly tolerable drain.

Largely fighting defensively until every foe is under her Quirk, then switching to a bruiser approach to knock them out with her fists in a direct fashion.

>Friendship
Bruh just ask them if they want to be friends social anxiety isn't even real just say hi and introduce yourelf lmao 
35.
Rosethorn was a stereotypical delinquent that picked fights over small things to make sure people didn't underestimate her. for most of her schooling she didn't actually use her power on other heroes, just herself and the enemy to beat them up.

In third year a teacher finally got her to mature and that caused her to mellow out some, focusing on protecting civillians before other things.
47.
Rosethorn likes Alfredo sauce, with chicken and triple cheese on it. Sometimes some beef too on a hungry day. But like, the crumbled sausage bits not like steak or anything.

"Ah, high school. I was top of my class, you know! I knew my facts, my figures, all of that smarty crap. 'Course, sometimes I'd get a little help from some of the real eggheads, haha! All I did to succeed was study, genuinely try my hardest, pull myself up by my bootstraps, and put myself out there! That's what today's students need. I say if you're failing, you just aren't trying hard enough. I always had detractors, of course, but they were just jealous of how well I was doing. Some things never stop following you! I mean, if you could believe it, there were rumors I was bullying this one kid! Real fatso, too, I think he was mad I could bench so much more than him. The girls were all over me, of course. Y'know, there's one thing about high school girls I love; I keep getting older, but they stay the same age. HA! Oh, I'm just joking, of course. You can take a joke, can't you? Hope you aren't like those pissants that get offended over every little thing. Plenty like that back in my high school days, but they didn't make it as far as I have. It's important to have thick skin nowadays! Well, anyways, I have to get back to my patrol now. Stay safe citizen, and have a MAJESTIC day! HAHAHA!"
57.
"Worst thing I've ever done? Well, if you believe the news media, you'll think it's that time I blew the head off of an "innocent" and "unarmed" mutant boy - but don't let them fool you! That mutie was clearly scouting out a new spot to rob, he was even freshly out of prison. Who knows the damage it's quirk could have caused!

"What was that? Allegations? Allegations are allegations for a reason; everyone thinks that just because I'm famous, successful, and handsome that they deserve some of what I've earned with my hard work. If there was even a shred of truth to what those women were saying I would turn myself in, like any true Hero would do.

"Alright, alright. This interview is over, places to be. Gotta keep on the lookout for those Night Parade goons, give them a beating they'll remember. Have a Majestic day!"

1.
>Does your MHA have a social media presence?
>Is it their real name, or their cape name, or do they have both?
>What do they post? Who do they follow?
>Have you been a good hero today?
Becky has a number of social media accounts, the vast majority of which she uses only to lurk. On these accounts, she does not track who she follows. She also has a moderately popular Instagram account that she occasionally updates with juicy gossip pertaining to particularly prominent citizens of Kyoto. In addition to this, she has a relatively quiet blog to which she uploads food reviews. She does not follow anyone on either of these accounts. She has not been a good hero today.

2.
>How do you feel about your quirk, fellow... uh... [name pending]?
>Is this what elevates you above the rest of the bozos? Is it a curse you wish you never had? Is it just a tool you happen to own?
>If you had the chance, would you trade your quirk in for another random one?
Becky's opinion on her quirk would be best summed up via the phrase "resigned acceptance". She vacillates between regarding it as a curse and treating it as a tool, but has drifted more in the latter direction as of late, since it's helped her to claw her way back to some semblance of solvency. However, if she had the chance to trade in her quirk, she'd do so in a heartbeat.

3.
>What deeds of 'heroism' have you done lately that you want Senpai to praise you for?
>Who is your favorite Pro Hero?
>Who do you think has the most potential, good or evil, among our up and comers?
>What's your favorite snack?
>Do you jaywalk?
Becky thinks that treating hero students is an exceedingly heroic endeavour but would not be particularly interested in being praised for it; she's just doing her job. Her favourite Pro Hero is Popsy, because whenever she checks in on her, she ends up feeling much better about herself afterwards. Potential-wise, she thinks Chris has the greatest potential for good because of his powerful quirk. She thinks the clique has the greatest potential for evil because she hates bullies. Her favourite snack is chocolate bonbons. She does not jaywalk, primarily because she does not think she'd be able to make it across the street in time.

4.
>Have you done anything to help others today?
>What's your ultimate move called, what's it do? Have you used it before? Did it work or fail spectacularly?
>Do you plan to commission any tools or gadgets when you get the funds? If so who from?
>Do you have exceptional Willpower?
>What are your thoughts on the Night Parade?
Regarding helping others, Becky thinks her job as a nurse is more than sufficient. She does not have a name for her ultimate move, but it essentially consists of calling forth all of her minions and using them to swarm her targets. She has used it before, and was able to create enough of a ruckus to get away scot-free. She does not plan to commission any tools or gadgets since she doesn't have any ideas for them, but she would like a faster laptop. She does not have exceptional willpower. She thinks the Night Parade pays well but that they have been awfully quiet lately.

5.
>Who would your character want to hang out with if you weren't at risk of getting arrested (like if you were suddenly pardoned of all of your crimes)?
There is no one whom Becky would particularly like to hang out with, but if pressed to give at least one answer, she'd say Christopher. She hangs out with him at least once a week, after all.

6.
>You got got, and you’re in jail now. Luckily, they’ve got you stuck in a normal holding cell for now, no considerations for your quirk, the idiots (if you’re an S-rank threat they’re prepping you for transfer to Tartarus). Still, there’s guards and bars. It might not be looking good… but no great villain is without at least a dozen escape plans. How are you getting out? Outside help, or just yourself?
Becky would probably try to use her minions to spy on the security and devise a way to get her cell unlocked, most likely by lifting the keys to her cell off of a guard. However, she'd probably give up if her first few plans fell through.

7.
>Let's talk residencies and bases of operation. What does yours look like? How is it decorated? For most folk this could be their actual house or apartment, but for the heroes who run their own agencies it could be their office building, or a villain's secret hideout, a supporter's workshop, etc. What's yours like right now?
>What would you want it to be like?
Becky lives in a dilapidated apartment in a decaying building sited in a neglected ward of Kyoto. It is not decorated. Her minions cover every available surface but are motionless unless she orders them to do something. It is a one-room flat with no kitchen and no bedroom, which means that she sleeps on her loveseat by the window and orders in everyday. It does, however, have a bathroom, which Becky keeps in pristine condition... if you ignore the chittering insectoids, of course. As for how she'd want her residence to be like, she doesn't ask for much; a larger apartment with more modern furnishings and appliances would be enough for her.

8.
>You got hobbies outside of doing school/heroics/villainy/whatever? We can't be all business, all the time, right? What do you do for fun?
Becky likes to go on walks around Kyoto to seek out underrated dining spots.

9.
>What do you think your biggest flaw is?
>Not in terms of strength, but in personality.
>Where do you fall short as a person?
Becky thinks that her greatest flaw is that she tends to be very agreeable. She's rarely able to assert herself in person and takes a long time to process things, especially if it's a stressful situation. She tends to act on instinct in such situations and usually only manages to grasp the ramifications of her response after the fact.

10.
>We've learned your flaws and your fears. Now I wanna see some big egos. What's your greatest strength?
Personality-wise, that is.
Becky thinks her greatest strength is her patience. She can put up with a lot to get what she wants.

11.
>What are your hidden talents? Things that people wouldn't expect you to be talented at, but you are. Maybe you're secretly a good singer, or a great chef? Could be anything.
Becky is a great actress. No one at Shiketsu has so much as smelled a rat as of yet.

12.
>What are you going to be up to during the Shiketsu sports festival? Will you be attending, and if so, for what reason? Are you going to show up to probe for the Next Generation's weaknesses, or are you going to be taking the opportunity to do a little tomfoolery while the heroes aren't as alert? Or maybe you just like watching the festival. I don't judge.
Becky will be at the sports festival as an assistant to the Doctor. That's her job. She'll watch and cheer for all of the students impartially, but won't pay any particular attention to their weaknesses, as she doesn't expect to have to face them in battle. She's not the type to battle others.

13.
>Aside from family or friends, what person would you say has positively impacted your life the most? It could be your idol who you strive to follow, or it might be some random guy you never got the name of who gave you some sagely advice. Could be anything, really.
The closest thing to a family member or a friend whom Becky had was the matron of the orphanage that she grew up in. She died shortly before Becky left the orphanage, but she taught Becky the importance of observing everything around her as well as the importance of patiently and methodically cataloguing her enemies' weaknesses before making a move.

14.
>What would you say is your most prized possession? Is it a keepsake from your family? A gift from a first friend? A weapon that's carried you through all your dangerous situations?
Her most prized possession is an ancient record-player gifted to her by the aforesaid matron, which comes with a vinyl record of Frank Sinatra's "I've Got You Under My Skin". It only occasionally works.

15.
>It's natural to regret things in your life. Whether it's something big like never being able to make amends with a family member, or something tiny like selling a collector's item right before it skyrocketed in value, we've all got things we wish we could do better.
>So a 2-for-1 today, friends. What is your biggest regret, and what's a really trivial one you still think about?
Becky's biggest regret is not killing more of her tormentors. A trivial regret that she sometimes thinks about is that she ought to have settled in Tokyo instead of Kyoto. On the one hand, it would have landed her even deeper in debt; on the other hand, she might have been able to make more money there.

16.
>Something's got you mad. Maybe it was a lot of little things building up throughout the day or it's something you brought on yourself, but the important thing is that this isn't something physical you can punch in the face to make go away.
So how do you blow off steam? Do you break things? Channel your seethe into something productive? Relax with a game?
If she's smaller, Becky goes out and picks up guys. She also keeps tabs on homeless people in her neighbourhood for if she's too big. In such an eventuality, she sends out her minions to eat them while they sleep.

17.
>What is your happiest memory? A single moment you remember to this day, that reminds you of good times (whether that makes you feel better or worse about where you're at now).
>Maybe it's a crowning accomplishment, or maybe it was just hanging out with some friends you don't keep up with anymore, or getting to meet your idol.
Becky's happiest memory is escaping the heroes who'd arrived to take her into custody. The feeling of sheer relief that suffused her body at the sight of them disappearing beneath thousands of biting, chewing insectoids is one that she revisits on occasion whenever she needs a pick-me-up.

18.
>How did you come up with your hero name? Is it something that is deeply personal to you or is it something that you could care less about. Would you ever want to change it if you had the opportunity?
Becky doesn't have a hero name, but uses a variety of insect-themed aliases to sell information to third parties. They're not personal to her, and she's considering switching to a more generic set of aliases so as to avoid tipping people off to her quirk.

19.
>We all have guilty pleasures that we indulge in from time to time, whether it be food, activities, or something else. What's yours? Maybe you like to sneak out to concerts for some embarrassing band, or you like trashy romance novels, or you eat ice cream right out of the carton.
Becky's guilty pleasure is watching reruns of old soap operas on her ancient TV set.

20.
>Does your character play /tg/? It can be a trpg, a tcg, or even a board game. What's your character's poison if any?
Becky enjoys single-player card games.

21.
>Do you participate in any clubs, and if so, how do you feel about how they are run?
Graduates in the extended cast, (are there any?) feel free to answer if you feel you made history or reputation that might have lingered.
Becky occasionally patronizes the First Aid club with the Doctor. She doesn't really care about how it's run, but she has a soft spot for those members who sometimes volunteer to help out.

22.
>Aside from the obvious answer of "your home," what's your favorite place to go? Whether to calm yourself down or cheer yourself up, what's a place you find yourself returning to often to feel better?
It could be a cliff with a nice view, an arcade where you hold the high score on the dance game, or that restaurant with great sushi.
Becky's favourite place to go is Thanks a Latte. The food is affordable, and Helene makes a killer hot chocolate. When she's starving, she drops by her neighbourhood McDonald's.

23.
>You've won the lottery! Whether you bought a ticket on the whim, found it on the ground, or just have a crippling addiction to scratch cards, you've found yourself in possession of a large (yet finite) sum of money.
>What are you doin' with it?
Becky's priorities would be as follows: (1) A new apartment. She'd splurge on stuff like a massive TV set, a highly sophisticated desktop, and several Roombas. (2) A car as well as driving lessons. (3) Some new clothes. 

88512445: Does your mha character pass the shopping cart litmus test?
Becky passes, but sometimes likes to guilt other people into returning her shopping cart for her.

24.
>How's your relationship with your parents, both right now and when you were younger? How did they raise you?
If they're dead, do you have any unresolved regrets involving them? An argument that never got cleared up, some decision of yours they never approved of, stuff like that.
Becky never knew her parents. She was raised in an orphanage.

25.
>What were your parents' quirks? It's always interesting to me to see how quirks would combine.
>And since that isn't really enough for a prompt on it's own, another question.
>How and when did your quirk first come in? What did you (and your family/friends) think of it at the time? Is that different from how you feel now?
Becky never knew her parents, but hypothesizes that one of them had a quirk which allowed them to generate some sort of material, and the other had a quirk which allowed them to produce minions from their own tissues. As for how and when her quirk first came in, she was a late bloomer, so she thought she was quirkless initially, and was bullied for it. When her stomach began to swell, the matron's successor thought she was a slut and shamed her at every possible opportunity. It wasn't until the infestation was in its terminal stages that the entire orphanage realized what Becky could do. To cut a long story short, Becky killed most of them and fled. She cycled through a number of aliases before settling on her current moniker.

26.
>What is something you're especially afraid of? Is it an irrationally fear of bugs? Is it a hero or villain that you're terrified of? It might be something that you're scared of losing. Something in your past resurfacing to shatter your life.
>How would you react if you came face-to-face with that fear right now? Do you cower and lose yourself in despair, flee from the problem, or rise above it and come out better?
Becky used to have an irrational fear of bugs, but that's mostly faded away due to the nature of her quirk. What she's truly terrified of is her past coming back to haunt her. If she were to be confronted with this fear, she'd probably drop everything and call in every favour she has to get the hell out of Japan immediately, accompanied by every last one of her minions.

27.
>To all students, heroes and villains, if you could change one thing about your quirk what would it be?
>If you could choose the quirk of another character over your own, who's quirk would you take? Provided you know everything about their quirk. After a 30-day trial, would you want to switch back or keep the new quirk?
If Becky could change one thing about her quirk, she'd adjust her Projection quirk to something more external and less consumption-focused. Materializing the material and forming her minions from there instead of... what she currently does. If she could choose the quirk of another build over her own, she'd take Drone's in a heartbeat. It's something that she's familiar with, and the minions her quirk produces are much more resilient. And she'd choose to keep it, too.

28.
>What's the fastest way for someone to get on your bad side with minimal effort? Do you really hate people who move your stuff without telling you, hate having your parents insulted, something else?
>How do you deal with people who do those things?
>How much would someone have to do for you to actually see them as an enemy, rather than just "someone you don't like"? Short of straight up doing criminal acts to you, that is.
Becky doesn't like people who're too friendly. She likes to keep things collegial. She tends to dislike people who are too intense. When this happens, she usually ignores them or treats them with a certain chilly politeness. For her to see you as an enemy, you'd have to lure her into divulging something about her past, her villainous activities or her quirk - and then betray her trust. Alternatively, you could also figure out either of those things on your own and reveal it to the world.

29.
>What's your motivation to do what you do? Why do you want whatever your goal is? (For example if you wanted to become the Number 1 hero, why? Would being Number 1 let you do something that you couldn't otherwise, or is it just a simple drive to be the best)
>When your back's up against the wall, what do you think of to drive yourself forward? 
Becky's motivation is survival and a comfortable life for herself. She's a very simple girl who is motivated almost entirely by self-interest. When her back's against the wall, she likes to recall the sensation of flight from the perspective of one of her flight-capable minions.

30.
>Opposite of the prompt from two threads back which is missing from this prompt comp, what small things do people do that make you think of them more favorably?
>What would you say is the easiest way for someone to become your friend?
Becky tends to look more favourably on people who treat animals well, especially insects. The easiest way for someone to befriend her would be to figure out one of her secrets and then tell her about it while promising not to tell anyone else... and then continuing to keep her secret. After a few months of this, she'd probably consider that person an actual friend instead of a dangerously loose end.

31.
>What’s the absolute cruelest, most character-destroying thing someone could say to you? The kind of thing where, however you brush it off (because we wouldn’t be great heroes or villains if some words were all it took to take us down), it’ll stay in your mind for a long, long time afterwards. The words that draw on your deepest fears and insecurities and use them as fuel for a precise verbal annihilation.
"They'll find you."

88611973: Prompteru: What's your opinion on the Pro Hero System and the Safety Commission? Do you believe that going through them is the best way for heroes to help the world and use their quirk for good?
What's your opinion on vigilantes? Those who voluntarily carry out duties usually done by Pro Heroes without paying attention to the law. Do you agree that they're a danger to society?
Becky doesn't particularly care about the system, the commission, or morality in general, but she does recognize that it produces a certain vacuum that she can exploit. She doesn't think vigilantes are a danger to society, and only cares about whether they're a danger to her specifically.

88664443: Here's a question for MHAchads, which builds are currently living innawoods? I know Chihiro scavenges in the woods, and Sandatsu seems to be living there. I have an idea for a writefag "solving" the housing issues.
Becky does not live innawoods.

88674305: Expansion of prompt from last thread: what's your build's living conditions? Do you live with your parents, or do you have an apartment? Do you have roommates? Do you own or rent?
Extra question for students; since there aren't dorms yet, how do you get to school? Do you walk, cycle, take the train, or even use your quirk, legally or otherwise?
Becky lives alone in a shitty apartment that she rents. She takes public transport to Shiketsu.

32.
>MHA, what is your go-to strategy in battle? Against multiple foes? Against one big powerful enemy?
>Switching it up, what is your go-to move when you want to befriend someone? Do you talk their ear off in class? Do you bring them gifts? Stalk them until they relent?
Becky's only real battle was at the orphanage, which was some years ago and involved her summoning all of her minions and throwing them en masse at the heroes who'd arrived to take her into custody. She's likely to follow the same strategy regardless of the number of foes involved. If she were to decide to befriend someone, she'd make a habit of thrusting food into their hands on occasion.

33.
>For MHA, do you have a tradition or ritual that you observe? Like washing your hands for 20 minutes after a fight. Or visiting your parents each month? Maybe you migrate south every winter (birds)?
>Bonus question, what would you do if a Mormon-like missionary rang your doorbell?
Becky takes off her clothes and puts them back on when she returns to her apartment. Then, she smokes one cigarette and drinks an arbitrary amount of alcohol. To her, it's symbolic of shedding her public persona and returning to her "true nature". If a Mormon-like missionary were to ring her doorbell, she'd weave him a sob story about being a single parent and try to swindle him into giving her a little money to tide her over, since her living conditions are obviously so terrible. If it doesn't work, she'll slam the door in his face and ignore him.

88077809: MHAnons, whose your character’s favorite rapper?
Becky doesn't listen to rap music.

88729939: What manual skills and abilities would you like to to develop or improve?
Becky would like to figure out how to fix her treasured record player.

34.
>If your current career path doesn't work out, what other profession would you be interested in? Assuming you had the resources to pursue it. Do you fall back in with your family's business? Or would you rather be a hobo living under a bridge?
Name one or two things that motivates you daily. Perhaps it's your desire to leave crushing poverty? Do you have something to prove? Or is there someone special that keeps you going?
If Becky gets fired from her job at Shiketsu, she'd probably fall back on a barista role at Thanks a Latte. If that's gone, she'd likely hole up in her apartment and devote her time to information-gathering and other villainous-adjacent activities. She would rather not be a hobo living under a bridge, but if things were to come to that, she thinks she'd at least be better-equipped to chase off any vermin by dint of having her minions consume them. As for motivation, her immediate day-to-day goal is to pay off the debts that she incurred to cover her tracks and land her apartment.
35.
Becky was in her second year of high school when she killed her entire orphanage. She underwent no additional schooling until she arrived in Japan, at which point she took a crash course in Japanese and then a crash course in first aid to qualify for her job at Shiketsu.
36.
Becky never goes anywhere without her tote, which contains a copy of all of her forged identity documents, her wallet, pepper spray, half a dozen different snacks, her phone, and at least one large insectoid. One side-effect of her quirk is that she doesn't technically need to go to the bathroom at all. She still takes care to go every once in a while to keep up appearances, though.
38.
Becky would make an effort to mingle. Networking is important, and a higher-paying job would always be welcome.
39.
Becky would probably become more outgoing when she's drunk. Lots of her inhibitions are learned and stem from a belief that she shouldn't let others get too close past a certain point.
43.
Alternate between relief and a vague, creeping sense of loss. Continue selling information about Shiketsu but prepare to leave Japan if the opportunity arises - same old, in other words. May have a few issues with dieting, but without the compulsion, I think it would be quite possible for her to get her eating habits under control.
44.
Becky watches American reality TV and soap operas, but has been branching out into gonzo Japanese shows like that one series where people get paddled if they laugh.
66.
Becky wears loose-fitting clothes that may be tighter or looser depending on where she's at in her false pregnancy. Cardigans, sweaters, leggings, blouses, dresses, pantyhose. No heels. At work, she has a uniform, but keeps it in her locker at Shiketsu.

>Does your MHA have a social media presence? Is it their real name, or their cape name, or do they have both?
He has a hero account that will remain untouched until he stops being an underground hero.
>What do they post? Who do they follow?
Follows top heroes, news channels, and places he can get exclusive information on Night Parade.
>Have you been a good hero today?
Yes, as always.
23.
Donate it, his family is already filthy rich. Alternatively, Karma steals it before he can cash in. 
35.
Yuusei was class rep in his sophomore and senior years. He was a model student for most of his school life until he met Karma and got his provisional license suspended.
45.
Yuusei moves back to the Atsushi compound to keep close contact with his family. Would keep doing hero work, but change from being a battle hero to a rescue/evacuation one during that week. In the 7th day, he takes a day off and spends it with his loved ones.
48.
Damn, this is a hard one. For Yuusei, I guess it'd be something like, "Don't rely on luck. Win because you're meant to."

4.
>Have you done anything to help others today?
By reducing the amount of beer in the local corner store, I've lowered the chance of a kid stealing some.
>What's your ultimate move called, what's it do? Have you used it before? Did it work or fail spectacularly?
Popsy's is the "Big Bozo Balloon" where she turns her body soft/elastic and blows into her thumb over and over until she's basically pic related. Then she hardens her whole body while huge so she can fight like that for a while. I like to imagine the last time she used it was against Tatarimokke. It used to be a real nice ace in the hole move for her to use when she was in her heyday, but she's been having trouble getting it up ever since her spiral into depression.
>Do you plan to commission any tools or gadgets when you get the funds? If so who from?
Shadow banned from almost every support company worth a damn. Maybe if she's able to recover her image or pull the wool over some fresh support student's eyes, she'll be able to get some more support gear.
>Do you have exceptional Willpower?
Yes and no. Her spirit is really down in the dumps right now, but given how she hasn't retired from being a hero despite her life falling apart around her, I'd like to imagine she's got a lot of willpower hiding in there.
>What are your thoughts on the Night Parade?
Given her nemesis is part of them, you can imagine Akagi doesn't have positive feelings about that particular group. Will attempt to apprehend any of their members on sight if sober (enough).
5.
If Popsy were sending out applications in a legit manner, she'd probably want to have someone who's quirk is similar enough to hers so she could actually teach them something. Not really anyone that fits that description very well, but I think the closest is surprisingly Inigo given that his quirk only works if he uses it in a specific way.

What would more likely happen is that Popsy would be watching the Sports Festival on tv, get drunk, and send a letter to pretty much anyone who looked cool or got the real shit end of the stick.

Personally, I think it would be funniest if Popsy got several people to pick her because she never actually expected anyone to accept. There's zero chance she has any real lesson plan on what to teach these kids and so she'd be winging it from day 1.

If I had to choose one, I think Chihiro's anon put it best that her and Popsy would make a ironic duo that could bond and maybe actually pull each other out of their self-dug pity holes just a little bit.
7.
As has been mentioned a few times, Popsy's base is just her shitty studio apartment. She doesn't clean or take care of it until someone's about to come over, like her therapist. Otherwise, it's full of trash and likely reeks. She'd love to have an agency building again, but that feels like a pipe dream at the moment. 
12.
>Which young hero do you think is worth keeping an eye on?
Popsy's got no clue on who any of the new freshmen are because she's been paying no attention to them yet. The Sports Festival will basically be their first impression on her.
>Anyone you're interested in taking as an intern?
If Popsy is watching this on tv, she's probably getting really drunk during it and would be sending out letters to plenty of kids afterwards. Those most likely to be sent letters are anyone who has a big cool moment that makes them stick out in her hazy memory or anyone she sees get the rotten end of the stick through no fault of their own.
14.
Popsy's prized possession is a framed photo from years and years ago. It's one of her and her father smiling for the camera in costume as a younger Popsy holds up her new clown egg. It was back when she became a fully recognized clown. It's important to her because her father was her idol and the reason she became a clown/hero. He was the Clown Hero: Patchy.
He's long dead now, and Popsy knows he wouldn't be happy about how she's handling her situation, adding a bit more shame in herself. Still, if anything happened to that photo, she'd be an overly emotional mess. 
18.
Popsy is a deviance from her father's hero name, The Clown Hero: Patchy. They spent time spitballing ideas for a while until they came up with an idea that sounded good to them both.

I used a clown name generator.
20.
Popsy's a mahjong girl and is pretty good at it. Not good enough to make it anywhere with it, but she'd be able to consistently beat the gossiping grandma circle.
She'd enjoy a tcg, but that's too much of a money sink for her right now.
21.
>Graduates in the extended cast, (are there any?) feel free to answer if you feel you made history or reputation that might have lingered.
Surprise surprise, Popsy was a drama kid when she was in Shiketsu. Probably left a bit of a legacy when she left, but by now people are willfully ignoring it.
22.
For Popsy, it's somewhere out of town. Down in a secluded back street corner far from the tourist spots of Osaka, there's this small booth of a restaurant. Opens at 6pm and closes at 2am, three days of the week. Only big enough to seat four people. Guy who owns it just does it as a hobby. Best food and beer in the whole city, and she'll fight anyone who claims otherwise. Owner just knows the perfect drink to go with whatever you order. You'll never leave unsatisfied. Best part, though? Guy doesn't know who she is. Doesn't follow hero stuff and she ever told him, so he doesn't give her the stink eye or judge her. Even when something foul comes up, his booth will always be a safe place to go back to for a good meal and drink.
He does know.
41.
Popsy has been recommended by Ito to keep a journal, yeah. She's supposed to keep a record of good things that happen throughout her day so that she can try focusing on the positives more. It's mostly full of stuff like "There was a good deal on cabbage at the market. Red Crasher beat Paradigm in a table match (I didn't gamble on it, I just like Red Crasher). A kid smiled at me when I held the door open for them."
43.
No quirk for Popsy? ...Is that anything new?

But seriously, it's actually an interesting look into her head the more I think about it. She already couldn't use her quirk that much because of her mental state, but there's a difference between being unable to use what you have and not having it at all. There are certainly worlds where this changes nothing in her life, or maybe even makes it worse somehow. The one that interests me is the possibility of her line of thinking changing now that she doesn't have the constant reminder of her mental health on her. There's a sense of relief in hopeless situations. That because you can't possibly do anything about something, there's no need to worry about trying to fix it anymore. I could see that happening with her. It's not going to cure her depression, but its possible that it moves her towards acceptance and from there getting her out of her current position. As for what she'd do? Well, she would likely keep up the hero line of work. Even without her quirk, it's not like she's going to lose in a fight against some random goons on the street. It's not the happiest end possible, but it's one of the less negative ones. I'd say this is like a neutral end for her.
46.
She's not a religious person, but Popsy would choose to talk to Buddha as he seems like someone who just had it all figured out. Just in the hope that he could give her some nuggets of wisdom to help her out.
49.
Should be pretty obvious since I've talked about it before, but Popsy's is easily takoyaki
52.
Popsy hasn't changed hers in a long time. She lets it run when she gets an unknown number calling her. If you're not on her contact list, she's not answering.
https://youtu.be/24VFmHOFlko?t=8
55.
I'm going to preface this by saying that I am extremely eepy and almost fell asleep a few times writing this. Autocorrect saves me here.
I dont think anyone in particular is in first place because I'm always hesitant to lock in a choice like that, so here's some I think would be good.
>Yui
Brought up last thread and feels like a good match. Student who can't normally get an internship and the pro who can't get interns. Yui's a cute kid, and the fact that she'll be biased in Popsy's favor makes the teamup work better. Popsy will have no plans on teaching anyone, so she'd be asking what they wanted to learn from her, which I think Yui would like because it's more free-form learning.
>Chihiro
Good kid and talked about it before. I still have the mental image in my head of Chihiro showing up at like 5am and bugging Popsy to get up and do something like a mom. PR Disaster gang.
>Inigo
Way back before he made himself into a good character and writefagging regularly, I answered this prompt saying him because of how his quirk works. His and Popsy's quirks both require a certain approach to make them work, and so I'm sure there's lessons that could be passed down to him. Plus he's funny.
>Hoge
You know that thing where when entertainers and teachers are looking for volunteers they're able to find the person who wants to get called up the least? In the tomeline where Hoge gets screwed out of her tournament match because she was unnoticed, I feel like that would be why Popsy sees her during the tv recordings and thinks "man, that's so flipping messed up" and sends her an apprentice invite thing. Popsy trying to make Hoge stand out more is also a funny idea in my head.
>All five members of the Clique at the same time
I dont even know what I'd do with them but sleepy me thinks it would be so fucking funny
>Ashleigh?
I dont really know much about her desu but someone suggested her last thread for some reason. Research needs to be done I'm so far behind AAAAAAAAA 
56.
As part of the loner division, Popsy's answer is one of those"if I had a billion dollars" daydreams. And despite what you may think, the answer is not Osaka. If this is just for a trip, she could pay 600 yen and take the train there. When it comes to vacationing, nowadays Popsy isn't the sightseeing-type. The Eiffel Tower is just another big building, big whoop. Stonehenge is a pile of rocks, whoop die doo. The view would have to be breathtaking for her to consider going all the way there just to see it to be worth it. No, if she's picking somewhere to go, it'll be somewhere that she thinks she can do stuff she would consider fun. That's why she'd pick Las Vegas, baby!
59.
Popsy as a maid... Likely, I'd say a gig like that would just be a 9-5 for her. She just goes into work mode and gets through it. She's definitely not a dedicated worker, but she's also not bad enough that it would cause big complaints. Though her cooking is mediocre at best, so I don't think she'd be stationed there. Then when she's done for the day she gets home and collapses on the couch again.
A master? I'm actually not sure. The only people she seems to hang out with are fellow poorfags. In this maid universe, she'd probably get the job off an ad listing rather than getting recruited for it directly. 
61.
I could imagine that Popsy used to be a good singer. Not to a amazing degree, but good. But now she's had years of smoking to fuck up her throat and lungs. She don't got it anymore.
She says that Smokin' Sexy cheats because his quirk lets him process smoke easier and that she's "dealing with the smoke how God intended, badly." 
66.
I'm also one of the anons that doesn't know fashion, but thankfully I don't need to.
With Popsy, what you see is what you get. She does not bother to get dressed up to go out unless it's for some kind of special thing.
Otherwise, it's a loose tank top, comfy shorts, sandals, and maybe a jacket if the weather calls for it. Then when she gets home she'll kick off her sandals and is ready for bed because those are her pajamas too. Comfort is king in her house. Usually wears her hair down, but will put it into a ponytail if it's really unruly.

###Bonnie Jovie HN "Birdy"
7.
Bonnie and Birdy live in a disheveled and rundown garage cluttered with various furniture pieces that reflect Birdy's eccentric taste for fashion. Vintage items, a collection of mirrors haphazardly placed, mannequins, hangers, expensive cameras, a shit load of expensive clothes just lying on the floor, and a cyclorama that covers half of the entire room. 

### Ryusei Sugiyama HN "Smokin' Sexy"
https://controlc.com/f61c3f6b
>Does your MHA have a social media presence? Is it their real name, or their cape name, or do they have both? What do they post? Who do they follow?
Not really. His dojo has a social media, and its primarily used for advertisement--a strategy that has not worked in quite a while. He has one with his real name, but he rarely ever posts and just uses it to read news updates.

>Have you been a good hero today?
"Depends on what your definition of a good hero is. But yeah. Did my job, patrolling, stuff like that."

>How do you feel about your quirk? Is this what elevates you above the rest of the bozos? Is it a curse you wish you never had? Is it just a tool you happen to own? If you had the chance, would you trade your quirk in for another random one?
"Hm. Well, to be honest, a quirk is just a quirk. It's a tool to be utilized by people. Quirks don't make the person, ya know. I guess I'd keep my quirk too, even though I'm not a huge fan of it. I never liked how dangerous my quirk could be, but at least I can control it, and that certainty is more comfortable than a random quirk."

>What's your favorite snack?
"Well, finally. A question I don't have a gloomy answer for. Favorite snack would be.. uh, a cigarette. Though, if we're keeping it more kid friendly, it'd be some fried rice. Super cheap, super filling and super tasty."

>Do you jaywalk?
"Who's asking? Cause... err.. no. I don't do that."

>Have you done anything to help others today?
"Sure have. I helped an old lady cross the street."

>What's your ultimate move called, what's it do? Have you used it before? Did it work or fail spectacularly?
"Ultimate move? Uhh.. that's a secret, and, hmmm, nope. Haven't had a reason to use something like that yet."

>Do you plan to commission any tools or gadgets when you get the funds? If so who from?
"Ha, well, it'll be a while 'til I get those funds! Probably not, either way. Just a smoke bomb'll do for me. All the other money can go to my dojo. Or maybe an apartment? The dojo's floor isn't really that comfy."

>Do you have exceptional Willpower?
"Well, I don't know about exceptional, but it's not like being a Pro Hero is a job anyone can do. So... guess I find myself in the middle ground, heh."

>What are your thoughts on the Night Parade?
"Those guys? Don't like 'em. I mean, who the hell sells CRACK to highschoolers? They're still teens! Real fuc--excuse my language, ahem, scumbags. We'll throw the book at 'em eventually."

>Which Hero Student would your character want to intern under them the most? Which would you personally want to intern under your character?
"Mmmm. Dunno. Guess I'll accept anyone who's got the passion for it."

>Your biggest crime-busting or people-saving moment. The kind of thing where you get a newspaper of that day and frame it in your office. What was yours? Or, if you haven’t had one of those moments yet, what would you want it to be? Stopping a giant underground crime ring? Rescuing a hundred civilians from a burning building? And piggybacking off of the Students’ question… what kind of hero are you?
"Well, I didn't come on here to brag, did I? Ain't been in the papers, nor on TV, and my office is missing a wall after I kicked it down the other day. I'm an underground hero. I'm content with doing my job."

>What kinda coffee do you like? Doin’ some market research, gotta stay ahead of the competition.
"What kinda coffee, hmm? Irish coffee, definitely."

> Let's talk residencies and bases of operation. What does yours look like? How is it decorated? What's yours like right now? What would you want it to be like?
"It's just my dojo. It's a little run down and shoddy, but its home to me. Some of the doors are missing hinges, walls got holes in them. There's a mini fridge in the lobby. I got a sleeping bag somewhere. It's a pigsty, but when I get enough money, I'd like to clean it up."

>You got hobbies outside of doing heroics? We can't be all business, all the time, right? What do you do for fun?
"Hobbies are kenjutsu, gaming, listening to music, cutting out coupons, patching up holes in my walls, napping. I'm runnin' out of fingers to count on, heheh. I guess that's it?"

>What do you think your biggest flaw is? Not in terms of strength, but in personality. Where do you fall short as a person?
"As a person? Hmm. Well, I don't know. It's hard to find flaws in someone as perfect as me. Ha. Just kidding. Sometimes I can be a little harsh and mean when I don't mean to, I guess."

>We've learned your flaws and your fears. Now I wanna see some big egos. What's your greatest strength? Personality-wise, that is.
"My greatest strength, personality wise... hmmm... well, you can trust me. That's one."
11.
Ryusei is surprisingly talented when it comes to playing the guitar and the bass. However, he hasn't played in a while due to a minor incident involving him smashing a guitar into a villain's face. He never financially recovered. 
12.
Smokin' Sexy's not sure, he's only vaguely familiar with the students. I'm sure he'll find someone with great potential soon.
14.
A silver zippo lighter, engraved with the initials R.S. Ryusei spent his pre-teen years and on in a foster home, raised by a woman he endearingly called Auntie. To train his quirk, she gave him this zippo lighter to light incense sticks with. He keeps the lighter well maintained to this day, keeping it in a small safe. He takes it out every year to light incense at her grave as a sign of remembrance. 
18.
Smokin' Sexy lost a bet. The name became funny in a tongue in cheek way for him, so it stuck. He always has a small smirk when people refer to him with his hero name now.

I was originally gonna go with Smokin' Hot, but I wanted it to be a little more unwieldy, so I settled on Sexy instead of Hot. 
20.
Smokin' Sexy likes Yugioh, and plays Master Duel, but doesn't have any decks or anything in his dojo. This applies for other card games too, which he can't play due to his dog Anko eating them all.
22.
Whenever Smokin' Sexy's feeling melancholic, he sits on a lone bench in a park at night. He likes to take this time sitting and looking at his surroundings, basking in the peace and solitude that comes with the nighttime atmosphere. 
23.
Smokin' Sexy would donate it all to charities. He's not rich, but he already donates part of his income anyway.The charity he donates to most often is one focused on researching dementia and Alzheimers. 
24.
Smokin' Sexy never knew his parents, but was taken in by his foster mother, "Auntie". Even if he did refer to her as "Auntie", he loved her like she was his mother. Despite this love, it didn't stop him from being unruly, antisocial and a delinquent as a kid--something that his foster mother chastised and scolded him for, in the form of sandals and broom sticks. Of course, Auntie never stopped believing in young Ryusei, always pushing for him to practice his quirk and teaching him about what it truly means to be a hero, thinking that he would make a fine hero one day.

However, her health declined rapidly once he got into hero school. Though she never saw him graduate, he still visits her grave every year to tell her about what's been happening in his life.

He has had many regrets with her, but his biggest one was causing so much trouble when he was younger. 
28.
Smokin' Sexy's bullshit tolerance is pretty high, so it's hard to make him actively dislike you if you aren't straight up just a bad person. Though, he will get miffed if you are inconsiderate towards others feelings, or gossip frequently. He'll respond by calling you out on bad behavior by making a joke about it.
30.
Smokin' Sexy'll like you if you've got a good sense of humor. Just dont' be stuck up or an ass, and he'll probably like you. Befriending him is a different story though, as while it is easy to stay on his good side--he doesn't really befriend people. You'd have to be the one to approach him, and you'd have to do it multiple times. 
31.
To damage Smokin Sexy's character, you'd have to dig and disassemble his ideals of being a hero. He knows he's a dog of the state and a tool for violence, and he can't even justify his work as being inspirational to citizens considering the fact that he's an underground hero. He feels as if he's basically betrayed the ideals his foster mother had told him about being a hero. If a villain/hero said all this, depending on who it was (and if they mention his foster mother), he'd either get so dispirited he lays down his weapon or get so furious that he beats them within an inch of their life. Either option would prove them right. 
32.
Smokin' Sexy takes a stealthy approach at first if possible, almost like an assassin. He stalks them, before lighting a cigarette/throwing a smoke grenade and landing the first blow. If he's surrounded, he throws down a smoke grenade and uses his quirk to slowly strangle everyone in the radius. He ducks in and out of cover, using his smoke to cover himself and make him hard to hit combined with his reflexes. Against one strong opponent, he'll try to stick his smoke on their face and in their lungs to completely shut them down by burning their lungs and shutting off their airways. It's just a matter of surviving while the smoke does its thing, as he is a normal human with no physical enhancements. Depending on how many enemies there are and how strong they are, he'll switch from an offensive sword style to a more defensive one, relying on his reflexes and acrobatics to dodge and weave through attacks.

Smokin' Sexy usually doesn't try to befriend people, but when he does try to, he eases up around them. He lets them into his own private life, as a sign of trust and respect. 
33.
Smokin' Sexy, on particularly awful nights, will bake a small cake for his dog. Baking is pretty precise, and it helps him concentrate on things that aren't his life.

If a Mormon-like missionary knocked on Ryusei's dojo door, he'd first be glad that someone's interested in his dojo--but then be quickly disappointed by the preacher at his front door. Depending on his mood, he'll either nod along and respectfully ask to not be bothered or, if he's feeling more devious, would recite an incredibly long winded sob story (with multiple tangents) that he conjured up to bore the missionary until they leave.
34.
If heroing doesn't work out for him anymore, he'll probably just stay in his kenjutsu dojo and try to be a teacher there. Though, that plan's taken a nosedive due to his severe lack of students. So, he'd probably take up fulltime as a bartender. Honestly, Ryusei'd probably be a really good bartender.

A little basic, but his two motivating factors are his Auntie's dreams and aspirations for him, and those still present that he deeply cares for.
35.
I've said it before briefly, but Smokin' Sexy was a total delinquent. He wasn't the loud type of delinquent, but he was still an angry, brooding, antisocial kid. He'd get in your face if you said the wrong thing to him, gave people the stinkeye if he didn't like them, fought villains on his own (spending a lot of time in the nurse's office as a result), broke a bunch of rules and only begrudgingly followed the ones he didn't break. Surprisingly enough though, he actually wasn't a bad student, as Ryusei secretly studied his ass off at the behest of his aunt who'd nag at him until he felt bad (it didn't take long for him to cave to her demands). He cared, he just didn't like to show it. Of course, as with most delinquents, most of the bad attitude was just a defense mechanism due to his rough upbringing. And of course, walls get broken down eventually, and his walls were broken down due to the efforts of a certain happy go lucky clown.

He was also a pretty skilled kenshi, so I imagine he joined the kendo club to spar and train. Despite his particular brand of sword fighting being initially unpopular in the club, he learned to play nice and eventually became team captain. Happy endings! I imagine there's a hole in the wall in the training area covered up by a poster somewhere.
Pic related, it's sort of what I imagine Ryusei looking like except he'd have no ponytail and his hair was much shorter.
36.
Smokin' Sexy always keeps a pack of cigarettes and a lighter in his pocket. Other than that, probably a small flask of alcohol and his wooden bokuto. That's pretty much all he keeps on him.

Smoke smells like... smoke, most of the time. His quirk is good at warding off most of the smell, but he always buys a ton of nice smelling products at least so he doesn't stink to shit most of the time.
38.
Smokin' Sexy greets the people he knows, grabs a cup of the punch, then goes home with it.

Ryusei isn't super superstitious, but he believes in omens and good luck charms. For example, a charm he uses is the "lucky cigarette", where he turns the first cigarette in a newly bought pack upside down. If he lives long enough to smoke that cigarette, he's lucky.
39.
Smokin' Sexy's alcohol tolerance is pretty high. He can drink a bunch, and it'll seem like he hasn't drank much at all, so he tends to hover around this range when he drinks because he'll still be relaxed and laidback. But when he gets REALLY plastered, he'll get really in his feelings, becoming miserable, ranting about how miserable he is and how shit his job is, etc, etc before smashing his face into a table and passing out. He only ever drinks this much around trusted confidants and at home.
40.
Smokin' Sexy loves good food and he loves cooking it. He'll eat any steak, but he's convinced that medium rare is the best way to cook it.

He's not a picky eater, but the he gets dejected and saddened when eating bland food.
41.
Smokin' Sexy does not have a diary. You can keep track of how good a day was by counting the leftover cans of beer and cigarette butts are laid around the dojo!

If he had a diary though, it'd probably go like
"I fed Anko some new kibble from the store. She doesn't seem to like it, so I think I'll keep on feeding her more healthy food." then linebreak "My life is falling apart"
42.
>5-6PM: Wake up, go back to bed, punch the alarm, get woken up by dog, wash up and rummage through fridge
>6-7PM: Quickly cook something up for himself and the dog, if there's nothing in the fridge, groan loudly and go to the convenience store.
>7PM-8:30PM: Light exercise, cleanup from last night, putting on something that isn't a black tanktop and boxers.
>8:30PM-6AM: Patrol hours.
>6AM-10AM: Doing something that puts his mind at ease. Gaming, hitting the dummy in his dojo, playing fetch with his dog, napping
>10AM-1PM: Drinking himself silly until he passes out.
43.
Smokin' Sexy would be pretty shocked at first and ponder how that'd change his life for the worse, then he'd immediately think of a different hero name. He can't just remove the Smokin' part of his name, cause then he'd be just called "Sexy". It's not even creative or anything, it's just an adjective. "Slicin' Sexy? No, Slashin' Sexy? Nah. Whatever, I smoke like a chimney anyways, I'll stick with Smokin' Sexy." Not much else would change, he'd still go on patrols and stuff, and do hero work if called on. He'd just get hospitalized way more often because of his habit of biting off more than he can chew.
44.
Smokin' Sexy's favorite genre is comedy. Black comedy, romcoms, action comedy, if it's funny to him, he'll like it. He's also a big fan of horror as a genre.
45.
Smokin' Sexy hears the news, throws his hands up in the air, and goes on with his daily routine for a bit. 20% chance for life to go as normal, 80% chance that he's totally dead. As the hours go by though, realization would set in and he'd stop heroing and instead spend his free time with his friends and loved ones, making amends, drinking less, spill the beans on everything that's been on his mind pretty much.
47.
Smokin' Sexy will put a bunch of hot peppers on his pizza. He likes his crust thin and crispy, sauce saucy, and cheese cheesy.
48.
Smokin' Sexy doesn't have a motto and I can't think of one, he either dispatches villains silently or pisses them off with taunts, mocks and jeers.
49.
To Smokin' Sexy, it doesn't really matter. Street food is good food to him, it's cheap, tastes fucking good, and cures hangovers like no one else's business. However, he harbors a secret sweet tooth and will get extremely giddy at the sight of yatsuhashi, dango and taiyaki. Mmm, sweets!
50.
Smokin' Sexy enjoys going camping as he enjoys solitude, but wouldn't mind camping with others. He likes to feed cute wildlife animals even though you're generally advised against doing so. He can't help himself though, they're just too cute.

### Edmund Connor HN "The Tall Man"
14.
His cheap suit and, by extension, his ratty wallet which he always keeps in his left pocket.
36.
Tall Man doesn't carry anything. He's not sure if this is because of his quirk, but he's incredibly quiet and can move very quickly, especially when no one's looking.
38.
Tall Man would snatch up food when no one is looking. He can make a whole cake disappear in a split-second.
39.
Tall Man would sway around a lot before collapsing. All in complete silence. He wouldn't try to avoid collapsing, either. His hands would remain at his sides up until he ends up prone on the floor.
43.
Probably work in the Forest Service as a ranger. Even if he suddenly gains the ability to talk, he probably wouldn't.
44.
Tall Man enjoys watching static on ancient television sets.
66.
Tall Man exclusively wears a suit. Tie (black), shirt (white), blazer (black), pants (black), shoes (cheap leather, black), socks (black). His belt had to be specially made to fit his waist. He does not iron his suit and some think that he does not know how. He only has the one suit.
### Kevin Thompson HN "The Purple Man"
14.
His Gadget, which is a microphone/diffuser that he uses to "charge up" his pheromones when there's no one to use his quirk on. That way, when he really needs to brainwash someone in a jiffy, he can give them an extra-strength dose. The microphone component of the Gadget is for his diffuser's "extra-strength" setting, which acts to spread his accumulated pheromones over a large area at a much higher speed than normal. 
36.
Purple Man keeps only his wallet and phone with him. His wallet contains his AmEx card, some other cards, and at least five different currencies. One of the side-effects of his quirk is that his pheromones tend to congeal when he sweats, resulting in some discomfort in warm climates. Nothing significant, though.
38.
Purple Man would do party tricks involving his quirk that invariably tend to end up more than a little creepy for all parties involved. People don't like people who can casually override their free will, who'd've thought.
39.
Purple Man tends to get incredibly liberal with his quirk when drunk, which usually ends up in him getting reported to the authorities. The Americans usually bail him out, though.
43.
Run through his savings in months and get a job as a cashier. Will occasionally forget that he's lost his quirk and subsequently get arrested for telling a customer to do something utterly deranged.
44.
Purple Man listens to but does not appreciate classical music and opera.
66.
Purple Man wears purple suits in all shades. Components as above, though shoes and socks are still black (or a very dark purple). He also does not iron his suits.

### Yuichi Ishida HN "Slipstream"
###Roland Walker HN "PsyKing"

###Ernst Hennig HN "Impakt"
32.
Impakt lets the foe come to him, letting his opponent get a bunch of hits in in order to build up kinetic energy in his body. When there’s an opening or they tire themselves out, that’s when Ernst closes in for the knockout. Ernst makes heavy use of mixed martial arts and flashy Jeet Kune Do moves, as his fighting style is all about throwing out combo after combo. His current favorite combo to use against villains is a rapid leg sweep, followed by a KE-enhanced uppercut to knock his opponent in the air, and then his iconic Crash Axe (an axe kick where he flips into the air, using stored energy to kick downwards, sending his opponent careening into the pavement). He switches it up often, though, commonly making use of boxing to deliver knockout punches should he want to finish a fight in one blow.
He was never great with making friends, but he wasn’t horrible at it either. Just strike up a conversation, and go for lunch if you click. 
33.
Impakt visits his dad’s grave when he’s unsure of something important and needs to talk it out.
Occasionally, he also visits his dad’s killer in jail. I had planned to make a writefag about this, though, so stay tuned.
34.
There’s no reason it wouldn’t work out for Impakt, seeing as his dad was the strongest hero in Europe, but if by some miracle it didn’t, Ernst would probably be a pro athlete, maybe in MMA.
35.
Impakt was highly recommended to his hero academy, and was a bright, exuberant kid sitting comfortably at the top of his class until junior year, when his dad Kraftwerk was killed fighting Damokles. It almost completely destroyed Ernst mentally. The school decided to give him the year off, understandably. During that time, Ernst was just angry. Angry at his family, at Damokles, at the entire world. It wasn't until a pro hero close to his dad that he interned under reached out to him that he regained his faith in the true power of a hero. Senior year, he was better off, but certainly a lot different, and he even had a girlfriend for a while, who he'd later pretty publicly break up with shortly before going to Japan for the hero-exchange program.
38.
Impakt's mingling with the crowd halfheartedly. If he's there at all, he's there with a few friends he trusts.
39.
Everything is hilarious to Impakt when he's drunk. Even a mundane story becomes riotously funny, and he thinks he's a comedic genius, even if it's a slurred joke in German that he gets halfway through before busting out laughing. Usually, he has to sit down, as the combination of alcohol and silliness makes his head spin.
40.
Impakt tries to eat a lot of protein in his diet, and when he can get it, he likes bistec de palomilla. Usually, though, he cooks his steaks medium well.
44.
Impakt loves old school action movies with practical stunts, not the CGI slop they crank out these days. He’s actually done a bit of stunt work for movies, so he appreciates the craft. Also, Hong Kong martial arts movies, for obvious reasons.
45.
I’m gonna try to stop it. I know it’s impossible, and I know I’ll die trying or break every bone in my body beyond repair, but I’ve got to do my best! Because a hero isn’t defined by the cameras or even the fans, but by what they do when their backs are against the wall! And whenever I stop a villain, whenever I see the relief in the bystanders’ faces, I know I have to stand tall and defend this world, because that’s what a hero does!!
*Gigaton Punch*
49.
Impakt hasn’t had the pleasure of eating Japanese street food yet, but he’d be a huge fan of soba and yakisoba. Back home in Germany, he occasionally will get a Döner Kebab if there’s a stand by where he’s doing hero work.
50.
Impakt would probably be fine. He’s tracked villains through the Black Forest and Alps, and he didn’t have much of a problem then. But if it’s going on a camping trip versus going skateboarding or lifting weights, he’d much rather do the latter.
52.
Impakt has only one ringtone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyz_2DEah4o
53.
It gets better. Dealing with pain never gets easier, but it does get better, I promise. There used to be a time when I was trapped in this loop of sadness. I’d think to myself, “I’m not strong enough. I’m not good enough. What’s the point of doing anything?” And for a while, that was the way I thought my life would be, as the washed-up son of a dead hero, confined to some tabloid. Because not having Dad around just hurt that much, you know? But now as I look back, I can tell you that it’s true what they say about every journey beginning with a single step. It might not be today, or tomorrow, but you’re going to take that step and become the strongest you’ve ever been, I just know you will. Because that’s what a hero does.
56.
Junpei, we’ve talked about this! If it’s our interns, it’s to the octagon in the gym. If it’s my sidekick, it’s to our main office in Köln! There’s this one restaurant a block away, I swear, you’ll never eat better. Dad loved the place, there’s pictures of him with the owner on the walls. 
57.
Impakt accidentally turned a villain into a donut. It kinda got swept under the rug due to the fact that it was around the same time he did the viral road safety ads, but there’s still news footage of the fight on the Internet. You’d have to be looking for it to find it, and even then, they don’t show the punch. 
58.
>Non-Alcoholic
The more likely option, as Impakt rarely drinks alcohol outside of extremely special occasions. It's either raspberry tea, a protein shake, or his energy drink brand High Impakt, now in Sour Apple! (He prefers Raspberry Rush, for obvious reasons)

>Alcoholic
When Impakt does drink, it's probably a lager. He's heard that Japanese beers taste similar to the ones back home, so he's eager to try one. There's also a foul concoction called the Crash Axe, consisting of vodka, rum, soda water, and preworkout. 
59.
"Ernst, Ernst, I appreciate that you did all your chores before I got up, and the meal was delicious, but for the love of god, STOP punching disrespectful guests!"
60.
Mine’s probably shrimp cioppino. Ever since I went to San Francisco with Dad, I loved it. 
61.
Ernst has a great voice for rock, especially with bands like Van Halen and Led Zeppelin. You should’ve heard his cover of “Hot For Teacher” during the senior talent show at the academy. 
62.
Impakt would try to raise his kid(s) like he was raised, trying to instill strong morals and training them in the Passionate Fist from an early age. He'd expect them to be heroes, if not wearing a costume then in their daily lives. 
64.
Impakt has a few items of merchandising, namely the High Impakt energy drink. It started being sold in the Japanese market fairly recently and is meant to be one of those "Preworkout+creatine" fitness energy drinks like Reign and Ghost. It comes in Raspberry Rush (Impakt's favorite, he likes raspberry-flavored things), Sour Apple Strike, and Passionate Fruit, among other flavors. He also has a miniature replica of the Crash Helmet for kids to wear, a brand of MMA gloves, and an action figure, which I'm guessing one of The Boys probably has. As per a long-standing Kraftwerk Hero Agency policy from his dad's time, the profits from action figures are donated to assisting families affected by villain attacks and the collateral damage of heroics. Some in the agency want to remove the policy from hero contracts, but it's been left in at both Impakt and Floor's insistence. Overall, though, Impakt doesn't like being seen as a product, as he thinks it cheapens the value of heroism. 
65.
Conditioning is a cornerstone of the Passionate Fist, and Impakt has a batshit insane conditioning routine he goes through to toughen every part of his body, causing hypertrophy and the ability to handle increased energy. His workouts go viral every now and then on Herogram due to their intensity. He also makes sure to spar every day. For specialized training, he’ll do stunt work or get hit by trains, absorbing incredibly heavy blows to help him manage the upper limits of his Quirk.
66.
Impakt loves his tracksuits. His go-to casual wear starts with a pair of designer aviators, a silver neck chain, some form of light jacket (either a black bomber jacket or custom yellow letterman he received as a gift for saving a tailor), a white tank top, tracksuit bottoms and a nice pair of sneakers. In the gym, he likes to show off. Rash guards, loose tank tops, and an infamously short pair of athletic shorts. Lately, inspired by his sidekick, he bought longer handwraps and has been wrapping up to his forearms like a Thai boxer. For formal occasions, he likes the cut of Valentino and Armani suits. He’ll usually pair them with Magnanni oxfords and either a matching black turtleneck, a silk shirt, or a traditional white button-down. His ex was Italian and helped him get some really sweet deals on nice clothing.

###Junpei Ozu HN The Standstill Hero "Floor"
41.
Junpei has no diary because he doesn't really set aside that kind of time to write. If he had to have one, it'd amount to being a miscellaneous to-do list somewhere on his phone to remind him of things rather than talking about his day.
"Cacio e pepe" (wants to learn how to make it because he saw a video online)
"Colors that go with dark gray"
"Archer pushups"
"Making extra money by setting up vending machines"
"How to style skinny jeans"

43.
Junpei would initially be sad and would delude himself into thinking that he doesn't need his quirk to continue being a hero, but quickly learns that he's just not anywhere as effective without it, go through a short somber period. Failing the hero path, he continues to practice martial arts, work out, etc. He'd probably start leaning deeper into fashion, exploring streetwear and getting into fashion history out of fun. Would want to eventually become a DJ or influencer and see if he can make money off of that. If not, try to get some corporate job in sales or just stay with the hero agency (if they'll have him) and see what happens from there.
44.
Junpei doesn’t watch a ton of movies in general, but if he had to choose a genre, he (covertly) loves romcoms (Set It Up, What Women Want, etc) - early 2000s are great, but anything recent does the trick, too. His second favorite is crime dramas with a preference for well-choreographed action and violence (Raid 2, Miami Vice) over the slow burn types.
46.
Junpei would love to meet Ad
47.
Junpei would do so! But later schedules another delivery person to meet them across the street and picks up a personal-sized white pizza and sneaks it into the office.
White pizza without ricotta and extra pecorino is actually my favorite. Pretty crazy you said white pizza. 
48.
>"Let the heart do what the mind won't."
49.
Floor loves corndogs like crazy. All kinds and types. So long as it’s a link on a stick slathered in some kind of batter or covering and deep fried, he’s all for it. Sauces welcomed but not required.
50.
>How are you at camping
Big city boy, so terribly.
>How would you handle a camping trip with others?
So long as at least someone knows what they're doing, he's cool going on a trip.
>Perhaps you're an avid visitor of Japan's many scenic camping grounds, or are you the type to die in three days without the loving embrace of modern civilization?
Definitely dead in three days.

57.
Junpei occasionally stole minor items here and there from 7-11s back when he was a hero student - not because he was especially poor or anything, he just enjoyed the thrill. Hope it doesn’t catch back up to him one day (it likely won’t!(?)) 
65.
Jun used to be super diligent about testing the extent of Loiter by seeing how long it could take before activating again, how long it could last at its peak, the maximum distance and the minimum (he'd use human partners to test this, of course), but it's hard to get in training now besides when he occasionally spars with Impakt. Has to rely on when villains are about. Either they try to run and he gets to use it, or they fight and he gets to use it.

It's actually safe to say his quirk is steadily atrophying...
66.
Junpei dresses like a more casual motorcyclist. No heavy pads or anything, but blue jeans or black leather pants, jacket, pants chain, leather gloves, black belt with a silver frame/box buckle, and maybe the white headband. This (pic related) is technically his go-to hero "costumes", mundane.

In a really casual setting, long cargo pants or jeans, chunky/regular dad sneakers, t-shirt with a graphic (likely designer brand), silver/gold neck chain, bracelets, maybe a trucker hat.

For formal occasions, slim chino pants, penny loafers, maybe opera pumps or black oxford shoes, either white or black, uniform color short sleeve undershirt - all neutral colors. Fully buttoned long sleeve dress shirt with muted colors or matching the undershirt color, tucked in. If not super formal, fully unbuttoned, short sleeve, not tucked in.

# Villains
##Night Parade
###Okane King VN "Midas" (LEADER)
6.
>You got got, and you’re in jail now. Luckily, they’ve got you stuck in a normal holding cell for now, no considerations for your quirk, the idiots (if you’re an S-rank threat they’re prepping you for transfer to Tartarus). Still, there’s guards and bars. It might not be looking good… but no great villain is without at least a dozen escape plans. How are you getting out? Outside help, or just yourself?
Midas can escape just fine. Touch the bars, or the walls, or anything in his cell, his clothes, and disable the guards from there. Get a hand on the guard's stuff to basically instantly disable them. If he's in a regular ass prison it was probably to send a message to someone on the inside, probably even the warden.
>What kinda coffee do you like?
Columbian espresso, black. It's nice to have a cup of joe on the go, and Midas would want the strong stuff from late nights of planning and dealing with unstable criminal elements.

###Cammy Link VN "Karma"
35.
Had to do online school because physical locations bounced interviews due to being a mutant. The government may subsidise housing for us but that doesn't make society accepting.

Didn't do college, got too angry about how we are treated and started stealing stuff and being a certified rascal.

###Haruka Pulch VN "Tatarimokke"
1.
>Does your MHA have a social media presence?
Of course. He's skirted banning over a heated debate on the aesthetic merits of the Korean people, but he's never gone far enough to warrant more then a short restriction.
>Is it their real name, or their cape name, or do they have both?
He runs it under the same alias he publishes his online manifesto under, with a profile pic of Rene Magritte's "Son of Man".
>What do they post?
Long winded diatribes plucked from his memoir on the purpose of life and the nature of beauty, and edited pictures of celebrities to show off potential improvements. He has a paid specialist to do the legwork on the second, and leaves the first to his secretary.
>Who do they follow?
Absolutely no one. His account exists to shill his book and call other capes ugly, nothing else.
>Have you been a good hero today?
A true hero's role is to preserve and nurture the world's sublime glamor. He is the truest hero. 
8.
>Hobbies
The memoir's already covered, outside of that he dabbles as a Sommelier but has a tendency to bounce between current trendy hobbies.
13.
When he was young he met an beautiful young lady, and she told him his feathers were beautiful too. Things have escalated since then. 
14.
Haruka Pulch owns a chair. It is a rocking chair, made from a bright white birch, with light engraving ornamentation and a small pillow stapled against its spine. He keeps it in an undocumented farmhouse roughly 18 hours of travel away from Kyoto. It is, possibly, the most beautiful thing he has ever seen. Every few months he makes the trip, alone, and simply sits in that farmhouse, staring at it for hours on end. In times of great stress, he uses a long rod to push the chair so he can watch it rock. It is the single greatest sustainable joy of his current life.
The chair used to belong to his grandmother, who he had a close but one-sided relationship with. She loved him dearly, as he visited often and spent every free moment of those visits in front of her chair. She'd rock away as she told her stories. And he'd be there in front of her. Staring intently. 
18.
"Tatarimokke" was a very late decision. He wasn't even going to be a member of the Night Parade until the day I posted him and I wasn't involved in pre-cyoa planning for it, I just saw Karma make a post wondering where the other NP members were and decided to join up myself. I googled "Owl Yokai", and the legend of the Tatarimokke came up. His power wasn't totally conceptualized until I read the Tatari's legend either, and the bit about "sounds like the infant he was in life" mixed with "summons spirit fire" to make Audio Ignition. In-universe I just chock it up to him being mildly spiritual and self-aware enough to make the connection. 
24.
Tatarimokke had an excellent relationship with his parents. They treated him very well, partly as he was their only child at an advanced age, so he did make an effort to return the favor. They never found out about his illicit business, both of them dying peacefully and happily while on a vacation in Switzerland. An all expense paid trip courtesy of their son to a spa facility, his last and greatest gift to them. He had them buried on the home estate, coffins filled with honey for the next generation.
25.
Despite appearances, this wasn't some sort of arranged marriage. His father was a mild-mannered salaryman and his mother was a humble librarian, their owlish appearance is what prompted introductions on a chance meeting. His quirk was discovered in broad terms at 6 during a heated argument in class, which coincidently reached it's peak at the start of a fire drill. Lucky kids. 
38.
>Arrive at the function
>Look left
>"This bitch really wore that?"
>Look right
>"This bitch really wore that?
>Leave the function
Tatarimokke lives a simple life.
43.
Losing his mutation means waking up in an entirely new body. A new flesh, a new face. Even if he's still handsome it would be a total recalibration of his place in the world. His face IS his worth, so if he looked in the mirror and saw a new face that wasn't markedly better then his old one looking back at him it would shake him up pretty badly. He'd probably end up getting himself killed doing something drastic unless Recino could keep him in place long enough for him to reorient and just call up a facial reconstruction specialist. If it were an improvement he might actually laugh the whole thing off, as he isn't actually very attached to his identity as a mutant beyond; "I look like an owl? Splendid. Owls are such beautiful birds."
Losing just the fire part of the quirk would be a rough blow, but it wouldn't keep him down forever. He'd either find some way to get it back or just use gadgets to compensate, as it's only ever been a means to an end to him.
45.
For one week he'd live as normal scoffing at the the rest for scurrying around and panicking, right up until the last night. The second he sees the sun setting for what might be the last time the dam breaks. Bitter even with the end on its way, he'll call every major hero and criminal rival that comes to mind and curse them all to hell before locking down in his basement, praying amongst his collected paintings for a worthy afterlife.

###Sebastian Needle VN "Plant Whispering Gangster: Greenfinger"
4.
>Have you done anything to help others today?
Why would he?
>What's your ultimate move called, what's it do? Have you used it before? Did it work or fail spectacularly?
I haven't really thought of an ultimate move for him, sadly. Sebastian is more of an indirect fighter, he doesn't personally punch you, he impales you with a bamboo that suddenly rises from your feet.
Maybe something like that but on his full range? I couldn't think of a name
>Do you plan to comission any tools or gadgets when you get the funds? If so who from?
He already has the funds, and no, there's nothing he really needs as a gadget.
>Do you have exceptional Willpower?
He doesn't really care about a cause, but he is very much willing to go through a lot to achieve his life's goals. His life goals are a spoiler.
>What are your thoughts on the Night Parade?
He's a member of them, so pretty good.
5.
>Hey Villains, who would your character want to hang out with if you weren't at risk of getting arrested
If by that you mean which heroes/students/supporters?

None. Sebastian has a big distaste for heroes, as he thinks them to be general retards who waste their skills on playing nanny.

After all, if heroes were good in what they did, he wouldn't be free.
6.
>Villains
There is an extremely big number of ways to do it- without special preparations, good luck stopping him. The most direct way would be to just implode the wall from inside out by bursting it with roots or something else. Similarly, most doors would have a hard time keeping him out due to this skill. Of course, if it's just a metal bar prison...he can probably just rip the thing off it's hinges. He's a strong boy. Sure he could do it the wealthy drug lord way and bribe his way out, but where's the fun in that?

Though this makes me thing...what can i do about his threat level? By all means, he's pretty much an S-Class Threat, but i can't exactly spare any EXP without sacrificing a major part of his character.

You got got, and you’re in jail now. Luckily, they’ve got you stuck in a normal holding cell for now, no considerations for your quirk, the idiots (if you’re an S-rank threat they’re prepping you for transfer to Tartarus). Still, there’s guards and bars. It might not be looking good… but no great villain is without at least a dozen escape plans. How are you getting out? Outside help, or just yourself?

Maw would just eat his handcuffs and then the bars and then release the metal against the guards. He would allow them to fire some bullets at him so he could absorb some of the kinetic energy to make his escape. He wouldn't leave before raiding their fridge first.
>What kinda coffee do you like?
Maw has a bit of a sweet tooth, so probably a caramel macchiato.
###Ginji Gō VN "Silverado, the Desperado"

###VN "Bogey"
43.
Bogey wouldn't let it stop him, he might be weaker and slower but he's still him on the inside. So long as his heart stays true to his ideal he knows he can eventually reach them. He's still Peak Condition without his quirk so he'd probably continue to be a villain and start learning to compensate for the lack of a quirk with gadgets.
45.
Bogey doesn't watch the news and has more fun than all the other builds bar Popsy anyway those days.
47.
Bogey likes it margarita with 12 olives individually placed on top.
His second favorite is quattro formaggi.

###Helene Lysingen VN "Noctiluca"
6.
>You got got, and you’re in jail now. Luckily, they’ve got you stuck in a normal holding cell for now, no considerations for your quirk, the idiots (if you’re an S-rank threat they’re prepping you for transfer to Tartarus). Still, there’s guards and bars. It might not be looking good… but no great villain is without at least a dozen escape plans. How are you getting out?
See, I could bring down the prison wall with a hydraulic battering ram or something. It'd be cool. But also that'd make it pretty troublesome to use the cell again for other people. So if I had to break out, I'd probably just make a copy of the key, open the door, kill the lights and make a break for it.
Assuming I need to get out quick, of course. I'm pretty sure if I just wait long enough then one of my regular Hero customers is going to show up and offer me a sidekick position or something.

>What kinda coffee do you like?
Big fan of Nitro Cold Brew. It's got nice mellow flavors and rich texture, don't even need to add cream or sugar.
But saying that it's my favorite makes me sound like a hipster instead of a coffee enthusiast, so I'll say I also like orta şekerli kahve (hey, Turkish Coffee is a UNESCO Cultural Heritage for a reason). And I know this is heresy to some coffee snobs but Vietnamese iced coffee (specifically, cà phê lá dứa) is great when I want something sweeter. Wait, that makes me sound more like a hipster. Damn.
Well, I could sit here for an hour and list every type of coffee (except Americano) as my favorite, but I don't think I need to do that.
7.
Nocti lives in a flat above Thanks a Latte. There is a severe lack of standard furnishings up there (aside from a bed), because she uses her quirk to make furniture whenever she needs it. Works to save money and practice her abilities simultaneously, so it’s a win-win.
The café itself is meant to be a cozy place, where you can just hang out for a while and work on a laptop or something. Warm lighting, wood paneling, plants scattered around the place, you know how it is. There’s a pinball machine in the back corner, too.
Those pastries aren’t made in-house — she’s upfront about that — but they’re still fresher than, say, a chain store’s stuff, since she gets hers from the bakery down the street.
8.
Aside from experiments in tinkering and coffee, which don’t count (since one makes her better in combat and the other is… y’know, her job), Nocti’s likes blending fragrance oils together. Partially this is out of necessity in order to be able to smell things that are not coffee all the time, but it’s also just fun mixing things. The café always smells different each day due to her constantly trying out new fragrances. 
18.
Noctiluca is short and makes light.
Noctiluca scintillans are bioluminescent plankton (small and make light)
This is both the in- and out- of universe explanation. 
20.
Nocti is part of an online game of Campaign for North Africa with some of her college friends.
It started before she graduated.
It's still going.
They don't even particularly like the game, but they're so far in at this point that they can't stop.

But other than that, she's a fan of older, more obscure board games in general.
24.
As evidenced by the fact that one of them was in Japan and one of them was in America, Helene's parents didn't have much affection left for each other. They loved her, of that she's sure, but she was still only really raised by one at a time. Even then they were both busy with work. So... distant, but caring.
Her mother's still alive in America, and does come to visit on rare occasions, but never stays for long. Still, they have a good relationship.
Helene wishes that she tried harder to get her parents to reconcile back when her father was still alive. They both cared enough about her that she's sure it would have worked if she really went for it. 
25.
Both of Nocti's parents had relatively straightforward and minor quirks, so it was definitely a surprise that hers came out so versatile.

Her mother has a small-scale illusion quirk, which can create illusions that feel real (though it's all in the target's head). It had some major size limitations though, so she can't make them see/feel anything larger than a person. Still, she makes use of it in her job as a fashion designer.
She's the one who made Nocti's barista outfit.

Her dad's quirk allowed him to solidify anything his hands touched, even things like air and water. Only worked on things he was holding or touching, and it dispelled when contact broke so usefulness was limited. Mostly he used it to keep drinks from spilling while he carried them. 
32.
Well, we just had a Nocti fight scene but I don't think that counts as a go-to since her opponent basically hard countered all of her "go-to" strats.
But in an open area against someone who can't counter being put in a box, she... uh... well there's not really a pretty way to put it, she sticks them in a fucking gas chamber. Forms a box around them, floods it with inert gas until they pass out, makes all of it vanish.
In terms of a general fighting style though, she usually opens up fights defensively, launching a variety of probing attacks and focusing on evasion/blocking until she figures out her enemy's abilities and limitations. Never goes for a kill because she knows the optics on having to kill people as a vigilante is 100x worse than a hero having to kill someone, so most of her strongest stuff never gets used, instead she focuses on restraining and limiting enemies' ability to use their quirk.

Of course, in any fight that isn't some extremely close matchup she often also just experiments with new creations to test their effectiveness.
35.
It was mentioned before but Nocti's got a Master's degree. Never mentioned what it was though, so now I'll just say Engineering Physics, with a minor in Chemistry (because she does mix up chemical bullshit in the back room and she'd need some type of experience to not kill herself).

I was going to wonder if that made her the most educated character in the MP but I think you need a doctorate to be a pharmacist so Aquarius has her beat there (unless she's a Pharmacy *Technician*, which only needs a high school diploma, but given that she has Drug Lord I don't think that's the case)
38.
Nocti's a member of the "hover in the corner awkwardly" gang. Either that or she's in the kitchen making drinks to hand out to people (doesn't matter what kind of drink. She just likes making them). She's really not a "party" kind of person, so she'd avoid the big crowds, probably leave early or find a small group of people she knows and stick with them.

Being a woman of science, she's not too superstitious... is what she'd like to say, but sometimes you just gotta say a prayer to the lab gods when you're working and your product is starting to turn suspiciously yellow.
39.
Nocti doesn't drink. Mainly out of paranoia that alcohol might have some adverse reactions to the myriad fucked up chemical cocktails she's drunk over the years.
If she ever does get drunk, what probably happens is that she finds some inane task like cleaning glasses and then hyperfixates on that. Effectiveness of this task depends on how drunk she is.
47.
...coffee pizza is a thing that exists...
48.
>"Someone's gotta do it. Might as well be me."
66.
I recall mentioning before that Nocti's mom was in the fashion industry, so she's probably picked up a bit from osmosis. Unfortunately she doesn't really get to use that knowledge much, since she spends most of the day working and in her barista outfit (see image).
During rare extended moments of relaxation, her style fluctuates wildly with no clear pattern between seasons, but there are a few constants. Nocti is a member of team "perpetual coat season," (thus will always have one on, whether it be a hoodie, blazer, trench coat, etc.) and isn't a big fan of clothing with imagery or logos on them, nor does she like dresses and skirts that much. Her preferred colors are black and blue.
She does rotate her hairstyle somewhat often, and doesn't really have any favorites there.

###Takigawa Shion VN "Shapeless Blade: Aquarius"
3.
>What deeds of 'heroism' have you done lately that you want Senpai to praise you for?
As a vigilante, Aquarius' heroic acts can't really happen in public, and a pro hero probably won't praise her for those.

>Who is your favorite Pro Hero?
Out of the Heroes we have so far, she does like Rosethorn for her decision to help out problem children, but Shion is likely old enough to have seen Popsy's glory days, she can appreciate someone who fought for people's smiles. Probably still has the clown as her number one to this day, one of the few people who still believe in their fallen idol. Not that she could resist giving a hug to a trainwreck like that anyway

>Who do you think has the most potential, good or evil, among our up and comers?
Excluding Chihiro (if Shion doesn't believe in her, who will?), certainly Kyoda Hiro for his quirk, Shion's own quirk and her knowledge certainly leads her to believe Hiro would be a very capable and versatile Pro Hero. In terms of personality, Hifumi would be a good pick, but she'd likely be very biased in his favor just because he might end up helping Chihiro with her problems

>What's your favorite snack?
Pudding, unfortunately Shion can't taste herself, even if she puts parts of her in the mouth, it would merge back and have no taste.

>Do you jaywalk?
All the time, but at least she takes care to look both ways before doing it. Can never be too careful with those things ya know? 
6.
>How are you getting out? Outside help, or just yourself?
Nothing too difficult for Aquarius, even without her armor to use acids or some explosive mixtures, she could easily slide via small cracks/windows, or just sneak around with a very small profile

>What kinda coffee do you like? 
Doesn't really like tea, strictly on team coffee. Despite not liking bitter things in general, Shion does enjoy coffee even if she more often than nots drinks it au lait, but would experiment other kinds of coffee on a whim. Likely an old customer in the Thanks a Latte from the old owner's days(and she does like the silly name very much) More importantly than enjoying coffee or not, she's on the "save/protect the signboard" squad, can't really let evil reign in a shop she visits frequently
11.
Unfortunately massages are something that wouldn't really be considered hidden since she's made of jello, but there's something: Cleaning. Shion is the world's squishiest roomba, she can slide over the floor collecting all dust and dirt, squish into hard to reach places to clean, and then throw everything she collected out, etc. 
12.
The sports festival is a nice special event with students giving their all and applying their quirks to their limits, it's certainly quality entertainment you can't miss, so Shion is going to be there to watch on that alone. She doesn't really plan on meeting any of them in the battlefield but if it does happen, remembering their quirks is just a nice bonus. Chihiro participating in it is another bonus, so three birds in one stone! 
18.
Shion isn't exactly the most creative of people, so she pretty much went with the simplest coolest thing that popped in her head that fit. Water in armor, armor = water pitcher = Aquarius

The 3 people who get it will know I'm just lazy and couldn't think of anything better.
34.
>For villains, how educated are you?
Fairly well educated, you wouldn't trust a random on the street to make your medicine would you?
43.
Outside of the lenghty period of physiotherapy she'd have to undergo to learn how to move properly (Can you imagine having to learn how to maneuver a human body when you're almost 30?), not much would change for Shion really. Sure she can't go on with her vigilantism anymore and that's an unfortunate situation, but she can continue with her usual life,working her regular job. It wouldn't take her long to get used to her more normal routine, looking at the positives is more her style

###Toru Imaishi VN "Kampai"
32.
Kampai is a deceptive motherfucker to fight against. Due to his Quirk, he’s tremendously strong when drunk. For many with his build, that means slower, single-target attacks, taking any hits on the chin like it’s nothing. Not so for Kampai. Thanks to his mastery of drunken boxing, he’s able to use his intoxication to his advantage, swaying and ducking around attacks unpredictably (pic related) He might seemingly fall asleep one second, only to sweep your legs when you approach. Against multiple enemies, he tends to keep his distance, striking out with jabs and ranged power shots to avoid getting ganged up on. Against especially powerful enemies, Kampai will pull together what little brainpower he has knocking around and try to formulate a strategy. Often enough, in spite of poor planning and/or execution, it seems to work well enough. When he knocks you down, though, he doesn’t stop there. He’s left his fair share of criminals paralyzed for life or in comas, just from his beating down on them. Assuming he doesn’t get hungry halfway through the fight and leave you unconscious so he can go eat curry rice.
Making friends is another story entirely. Toru’s usually fairly withdrawn, but a lot of his co-workers in the PR firm are extroverts, so they’ve befriended him, not the other way around. He usually comes out of his shell with some alcohol in his system, unsurprisingly, so if you want to make friends with him, take him to an izakaya 
38.
Is there a bar? That's where Kampai is.
39.
Kampai's a pretty reserved guy at the office. Just keep your head down, do your work, and pray your cunt of a boss doesn't make you work overtime after a pro destroys some apartment complex. However, when drinking with his coworkers, he tends to drop the facade of politeness. His honesty and rambling is viewed as endearing by his coworkers, but given his Quirk, the drunker he gets, the angrier and more violent his behavior becomes. He usually knows to leave to do hero shit around the "cutoff time" for his socially tolerant self. His strongest attack/mode, Eight Drunken Immortals Released Formation, is basically where he gives himself alcohol poisoning, using his extremely high BAC to accomplish inhuman feats of strength and speed. Alcohol poisoning is only temporary for him, as his body metabolizes the alcohol in his blood, though you really don't want to be around for the hangover.
48.
“I can quit any time I want”
49.
A solid 90 percent of Kampai’s diet is street food. Due to his enhanced metabolism when drunk, he gets extremely hungry, and usually goes for calorie dense foods. But his absolute favorite, the undisputed MVP of drunk street foods in his eyes is yakitori. His enhanced sense of smell picks up the aroma of grilled meat that comes off of those little stalls and locks on to it. He’s even stopped fighting to go get some.
50.
Kampai has no clue what he’s doing at all. He grew up in a working class family that didn’t have time for those sorts of things, so what makes you think he’d be able to camp in the wilderness? He’s a city boy through and through.
51.
Kampai lives in a solidly lower-middle class area close enough to the entertainment/nightclub district he prowls at night. The security guard in his apartment is often sleeping instead of looking at the security cameras when Toru shambles back home from a night of bottled violence, fortunately for him. There’s also a Filipino woman on his floor with some mental issues, and he tries to steer clear in the most courteous way he can on his way to work in the morning. The only reason he’s able to afford his rent is because of his PR job at a hero agency. If he went to AA, maybe he’d be able to get a better apartment. For now, though, he’s stuck with this one, and maybe the landlord will fix the gurgling pipes this week like he promised. 
52.
Kampai uses Hypnotize by Notorious B.I.G. as his ringtone for most of his contacts. For work calls, he just uses the default tone. 
59.
Kampai, in spite of his alter ego, wouldn’t be a horrible butler. He looks good in a suit, and his experience working in public relations for 360 Hero Agency would help him maintain decorum. Because he’s a rather mild-mannered guy normally, he might escape his master/mistress’ attention. Just don’t let him get too relaxed on break. 

###Yushi Taneka VN "Blazing Bright"
57.
Blazing Bright may have committed a few "incidents" when he was getting the hang of being a vigilante; nothing mortal, but some criminals may have received some serious injuries 
65.
Being a Vigilante means that standards of fitness are looser compared to official heroes, but Blazing Bright still takes advantage of his heroic sorties, taking the occasion to train his speed quirk both in supersonic sprints across the whole city, and endurance runs. Now that he's about to return after his extended vacation, he must take a more intensive schedule to fully recover to his peak form
66.
Taneka wears simple and casual, doesn't really have a fashion sense

##Unaffiliated

###Bruno Garcia VN "Mauler"
###Nakata Yumiko VN "Thrill Seeking Thief: Walpurgis"
5.
Yumiko would try and celebrate their growth in popularity via sweets for Chihiro. Instead passively seethes upon seeing Momotaro getting there first.
14.
Ever since taking over the family business, Walpurgis has cherished the craft her mother taught her. Despite the business's lack of customers these days, it continues to operate under a false name and identity, thanks to her connections in the criminal underworld. Through her skullduggery, she anonymously supports her retired parents, although they do not approve of her chosen profession. Nevertheless, Yumiko still holds filial piety towards them. She repairs articles of clothing for fellow villains in the backroom, be it costumes or small items like handkerchiefs. 

###Shiori Shiratora VN "Kamigami"

###Momotaro Tachibana
2.
>How do you feel abou your quirk?
Momo doesn't care much, for her the quirk is just another part of who she is, like lungs, heart or liver, she probably would be close to who she is if she somehow got another quirk, but it wouldn't be who she is today. 
4.
>Have you done anything to help others today?
Afraid not.
>What's your ultimate move called, what's it do? Have you used it before? Did it work or fail spectacularly?
Divine Rapture. It basically consists of producing a great quantify of life force and put it into the tip of a blade and them slash/thrust against the enemy, injecting all the energy into the enemy and into a single point, making the area it landed unravel and shred to a gruesome degree.
>Do you plan to comission any tools or gadgets when you get the funds? If so who from?
Not yet.
>Do you have exceptional Willpower?
Absolutely, her whole gimmick is being too passionate, so giving up when there is chance to win isn't an option.
>What are your thoughts on the Night Parade?
To be targets.
5.
Momotaro is a shameless person, she will still hang out with Chihiro even knowing they are literal enemies due their choices.
11.
She is a really good singer and knows how to change her pitch very well, she generally likes to sing musics that require a deeper/stronger tone tho. 
18.
Momotaro ex-hero/villain name is made after the hero name of her father: Rumbling Storm.

###Miki Genrei VN "Devil Armed With Wings, Fluegel"
4.
>Have you done anything to help others today?
"You shouldn't leave the window open, Rosethorn-sensei. What if someone catches a cold? See, Fluegel helped~!"
>What's your ultimate move called, what's it do? Have you used it before? Did it work or fail spectacularly?
Doesn't have one yet, but if she ever needs one she will come up with it on the spot.
>Do you plan to commission any tools or gadgets when you get the funds? If so who from?
Flugel already has the one tool she needs and if she needs another one, she already has someone in mind.
>Do you have exceptional Willpower?
Yes, actually. Miki despite the strain, pretty much uses her quirk constantly, leaving her in an almost permanent state of drowsiness and yet that never stopped her from... 'doing the right thing'.
>What are your thoughts on the Night Parade?
"Flue doesn't know~! Isn't that the group led by that old lady?"
6.
If Momo got into Prison, she would use her quirk on the hand cuffs or prison bars until they crumble due overextending their limits due her quirk, knock out the guards (and take a few trophies while at it) and be done with it.
53.
Fluegel convinces herself that she isn't at fault, but either everyone else is or it's just circumstances beyond her control.
>Why do the other villains never invite me to do crime?

###Hiromi Hitomi VN "Apex Predator Villain: Feral"
###Hina Seiyama VN "Panzer VIII"

###Mark Matuli
12.
Mark Matuli has no reason to fight these people. But the likelyhood of an eventual conflict is high.

Matuli will watch TV and take notes, in a sinister and morally ambiguous manner. 
14.
Matuli isn't attached to any object in particular. A stack of gold is useful but it doesn't have attachment.
The closest to real attachment would be whatever mask he's wearing at the time. Besides the obvious benefit of hiding identity, there is a psychological attachment to the action of wearing a mask there too. 
17.
Matuli's happiest memory is feeling at peace in a remote town. Considering he'd managed to get a SAM system installed hidden in one of the barns, he was feeling pretty good about his moment to moment security. Combined with other countermeasures set up around the place it really did feel like he could calm his mind. Resting on a comfortable bed and drinking some cold water he let out a sigh. That sigh is the highlight of the memory, releasing some tension from a level he hadn't even realized he was holding. 
20.
Chess is of some interest to Matuli but they don't play often. As they're in Japan now they are thinking about picking up local games. When he where much younger they played the Pokemon tcg but that's way in the past. They barely played it right anyway, but none of his friends really knew what they where doing either. Calvinball rules really, just some kids having fun.

###Jack Mitchell VN "Marshall"
22.
The scorching battlefields of Central Africa is where Marshall chose to spend their free time - rappelling down from a tilt-rotor on a heavily defended base, head-on assault into a quirk-using militia, ... Without a care for their life or their equipment, Marshall's clone participated in dozens of minor conflicts, serving small contracts with dozens of sides, further sowing chaos on the dark continent.
All of those actions gave them the dopamine and adrenaline rushes they desperately needed after managing the intricate web of connections that's the international criminal network. 

###Junichi Takagi VN "Marrow"
22.
There's a park that Junichi always went with his family when he was little, and it's become a place of comfort for him in the years since they died, to the point where he'd often find himself escaping from foster care in order to go there. 
23.
Junichi would literally not know what to do with it. He might spend some of it on the things your typical teen would, indulging himself, but the feeling would quickly hollow, and he'd probably just leave it in the bank or donate it to charity.

It would not occur to him to pass it on to the revolutionary organization he's a part of.
24.
They're dead.

>How's your relationship with your parents... when you were younger? How did they raise you?
It was tough at times, Junichi always had a bit of a rebellious streak, and was honestly a bit of a brat. Grew up with a chip on his shoulder due to his... troublesome quirk, but his parents did their best to raise him right; always assuring him that he didn't need to become a Hero to live his life, and just trying to encourage him to live well and find success however he could. Suffice to say, they were caring parents.

>Do you have any unresolved regrets involving them?
Oh yeah. As outlined above, Junichi was somewhat of a troublesome child, and given the sudden nature of their death, he regrets it a lot. He looks back, and wishes he was better for them. He never knew what he had until he lost it. 
25.
>What were your parents' quirks?
The ability to manifest and control skeletal parts outside the body, for his father, and the ability to manipulate and alter her own skin, for his mother.

His father could've gone pro Hero, but eventually decided not to, whereas his mother mainly used her quirk for its minor self regenerative properties and beyond perfect skin care, which allowed her to stay youthful in appearance up to her death.

>How and when did your quirk first come in?
At around the age of six or seven. It was a particularly stressful moment in a simple childhood soccer game, and Junichi's quirk manifested when he tried to block a shot he otherwise wasn't going to catch, to the effect of numerous spikes of bone exploding out of his arm like branches on a tree, catching a few other kids.

It was incredibly painful. The bones had to be sawed off, and the remnants of that first manifestation still remain as small nubs/protrusions of bone randomly along Junichi's forearm (left, to be specific; he's a lefty).

>What did you (and your family/friends) think of it at the time?
His parents were incredibly concerned, and Junichi himself was absolutely terrified. It gave him nightmares for quite some time, and he basically never used his quirk because of it.

>Is that different from how you feel now?
It is. Junichi's views his quirk now as a valuable tool, one of the few he has to make actual change, even if it is only through violence, so even though it arguably traumatized him, he is adamantly devoted to utilizing and training his quirk. 
26.
Junichi is afraid of his own quirk. But that was already covered in... the last prompt I think? Aside from that, he's afraid of snakes. Just deathly afraid of snakes. If confronted by one, he'd probably freak out and run.
27.
>if you could change one thing about your quirk what would it be?
"I wish it wouldn't hurt so much..."

>If you could choose the quirk of another character over your own, who's quirk would you take?
Probably Radius'. It's familiar enough, superficially, that Junichi could choose it on that factor alone.

>After a 30-day trial, would you want to switch back or keep the new quirk?
Junichi would definitely switch back. He'd feel guilty at abandoning the quirk inherited from his parents. 
30.
>what small things do people do that make you think of them more favorably?
Junichi is stuck forcing himself to think negatively of people habitually, so just being a genuine and good person (not even necessarily nice, mind, just good) will slowly build up a more favourable impression, as much as he'd try to put up more walls and distance.

>What would you say is the easiest way for someone to become your friend?
The easiest way? Persistence, probably. A shared interest in mecha anime would help a lot, but since Junichi doesn't let himself engage with that particular interest these days, it would have to be through happenstance.
31.
Simply put, if someone were to point out that Junichi was simply angry and lashing out because of it, it would strike home, hard. The world is unfair, but people who lash out because of that? Those are villains, not revolutionaries. "You're not actually trying to change anything. You're just trying to make yourself feel better by breaking things."

Junichi has only been drunk once or twice, but when he gets drunk? He passes the fuck out
43.
Junichi would probably self-destruct. Deep down, he'd be relieved that his quirk was gone, but an entirely new anxiety would grip him; What could he possibly do now?

He'd push himself even harder to train, shut out even more of his life and any positive thoughts, and probably turn into a complete jaded vigilante serial killer, targeting heroes and villains alike.

The methods he previously would've reasoned himself into avoiding are just suddenly the only viable path he can see himself taking. It wouldn't occur to him to step away and try and live a normal life, not without a serious intervention.

Junichi has a song he likes set as his default ring tone. He doesn't set unique ringtones; not like he has any contacts in his phone he would do that for, if he did; he just doesn't have any contacts listed pretty much. Maybe Inigo, but that's about it.

The pain doesn't go away. It only serves as momentum, motivation to push forward. If you stop moving forward, you freeze to death under the weight.
58.
Junichi got dragged into a Mecho Corez 12 tournament with Inigo and the Five. He's drinking WcDonald's Sprite. He has some nice green tea at home, but that can come later. After he wins. 
65.
Junichi trains his quirk by using it to push his pain tolerance, and experimenting with new constructions to make. Just figuring out what new ways he can creatively use his ability.
66.
Depends on the day, but Junichi can often be found wearing button-up shirts, ties, etc, usually with jeans. Very Visual Kei. Sometimes he wears a sweater, sometimes not. Almost always accompanied by a jacket.

On special occasions, he might switch to a more regular style, closer to business casual, but given his many piercings, he still looks a bit punk even at the best of times.

I would prefer to throw them at some cult's lair and solve the villain problem right then and there. We could walk out with some newly minted pros from it.
>We're gonna have to handle internships soon, though
Yeah!

But if we were to talk about where I want to go personally, maybe I'll take a trip to the royal's castle in England. That's the only remaining real monarchy in the world, you know?
For a cheaper vacation, maybe a trip up Mount Fuji? I probably can get up there solo.
I thought maybe a beach would be nice, but there's just too much water.
