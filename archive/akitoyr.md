**BEFORE YOU INTERACT**
i'm very random most of times, i'll warm up quick if we seem to be
hittin it off, i purposely make typos, i sometimes replace words w numbers
sometimes ( "im waiting 4 u" ), **i tease & be mean to my friends for jokes**,
i get irritated easily so i apologize if i get aggressive around u or others,
i may say some stuff repeatedly, i cannot tell the tone of your messages or
read the room, please do use tonetags ( not excessively, though ), 
i am brutally honest most of the time, i say questionable stuff
but i dont really mean them

**DO NOT INTERACT**
nothing much besides [th](https://listography.com/akit)is. i'll just block
or not interact at all if i dont like u lol

**NOTE**
i dont care if you flirt w me. just keep in mind that if you do it w/ romantic
intent, don't expect me to return such intentions unless i look like i share the
same feelings as you..
also note that i probably won't flirt back, but if i unconciously flirt then please
tell me! 
every single display of affection is **platonic** unless stated otherwise.
