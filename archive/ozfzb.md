Pandaren cookie
.
.
>Be you
>Average hunter 
>Just finished a quest in some valley and need to fill your belly
>Spot a unique place in the town close by that peaked your interest
>A restaurant with with tiled squares on it's roof and a bunch of red lanterns that seem to be made of paper
>You decide to go inside to see what's it about and you notice something after that
>Everyone working there is a pandaren
>Except for one waiter who seems to be a guy like you
>Even a good amount of the customers seem to be pandaren 
>Decide to take a seat at a counter that's close to the kitchen and wait for the waitress there to ask her what they have
>Haven't heard about any of the stuff she's suggesting to you
>Decide to just order the "Ramin" and a small beer
>Your stuff Arive later and you notice two things
>The "small beer" you ordered was actually really big, which made you ask the waitress if she got your order wrong but she confirms that this is indeed the small beer
>Second thing you notice is that the "Ramin" you ordered seems to be just a big bowl of those instant noodles you tried once
>It definitely tasted much better though
>After finishing up your meal and drink, the pandaren waitress comes by to pick up your empty cup and bowl
>This is one of the few times where you are close to a lot of pandarens which made you look again about how much taller and bigger they are then you and the average man
>Also how curvy some of their women can be...
>The pandaren waitress Infront of you was no exception, as she had a very wide figure and a huge...bosom
>As you are picking up some money from your pockets to pay for your meal, you notice that your pandaren waitress left a small plate Infront of you
>The plate seems to have a folded piece of pastry 
>You call the waitress to tell her that you didn't order this
>She looks at you for a moment before warmly smiling at you
"This is no accident, but a treat from us to you, a fortune cookie"
>You hear the name and sorta remember hearing about something like that
>You ask her if it has like something in it that decides your future luck or something, which she nods after
"That is true, but if you wish to leave it, you wouldn't be blamed"
>You look at her with a confused expression, not really understanding why no one would want to try it
"Not everyone can handle what fortune they get~"
>And with that, she leaves you so she can serve the other customers 
>You look back at the cookie for a moment and decide that you will take your chance with it
>Maybe it will get you something good
>And there's also a side of you that sorta believes that this won't actually do anything, so you also want to see if it actually works
>You crack the cookie open so you can see what's inside it and see...a paper?

|Big things are going to happen soon|

>Big things, huh?
>Well you hope these big things are good
>You discard the paper on the counter and eat the two halfs of the cookie
>It doesn't really taste bad or good 
>You turn around on your stool to get up and leave but suddenly feel that something is wrong
>You start to feel something weird in your stomach and a little dizzy
>Did you have too much alcohol...?
>Before you can question it any further you feel your self blackout
>...
>You finally come to your senses and wake up
>You feel like you've been hit by a truck 
>All of your body feels sore all over
>You open your eyes and look around
>...
>You seem to be inside the same restaurant you were in before blacking out
>Still on the stool you were sitting on, even
>But there's just a tiny, little different
>You have been shrunk
>Like shrunk really really small
>You are probably a 1/20 of your original height
>You look around some more, and while it is a bit hard to see far with how small you are, you can tell that this place is pretty much empty, other then the people working here
>Do you black out until their closing time?
>You see one of the pandaren workers getting closer to you and you try to get their attention, but to no avail 
>Wearing red while you are on top of a red stool in a place that's pretty red is probably not in your favor now
>Before you think about taking them off in hope someone sees you, you notice another pandaren coming closer to you
>It seems to be the waitress who actually served you your food before all this happened
>She also seems to be carrying a big try with some food and beer
>You start to throw your hands in the air to get her attention, but realize something 
>She is getting really close to you
>...She's going to sit on one of the stools
>On the stool you are now on
>You try to scream as loud as possible to get her attention, but to no avail 
>You realize now that you should have moved out of the way but it is too late now
>The pandaren waitress sits right on top of you
>It seems that almost everything has turned black
>You feel a great weight on top of you
>You can still hear some sounds here and there, although a bit muffled
"Haa~ finally! Today was really busy, and I was getting really hungry since I didn't have lunch"
>After that you hear the sounds of someone eating and drinking
>You also hear some other people talking but you honestly can tell what they are saying
>The only person you can hear and understand is the one sitting on top of you
>You try to struggle, maybe you can wiggle your way out of here
>But it seems that the pandaren sitting on you felt something moving under her
>Which causes her to shift her butt left and right 
>She probably thinks you are a bump on the stool and is trying to smooth you out
>All this causes you is to shift to be places right below her buttcrack
>She also seems to start to put all of her weight on top of you now
>The difference in mass and size has become so great now, that you can't even struggle anymore
>Breathing is also getting harder, since your lungs are starting to get filled with the musky smell of her sweat
>Calling this situation weird was probably an understatement
>With the weirdest part being that...you didn't really dislike this
>Despite the great volume difference in mass, it didn't hurt at all
>It felt like your sandwich between a mattress and a giant pillow
>And it felt really warm, like you were covered all head to toe in a heavy blanket full of fur
>And the smell was slowly starting to grow on you, with you thinking it's not that bad
>But you still knew you needed to get out of here
>Sadly barely anything worked, with it either getting you nowhere, or getting the pandaren women sitting on top of you to wiggle more, smooshing you more into her backside
>When it seemed like this will never end, you felt the weight on top of you getting lighter
>At first it seemed that she is getting up, and all this will be over
>Until you realize that you were smashed so hard into her ass, that your ended getting caught in her buttcrack
>You try to struggle to free yourself but end up not being fast enough, getting trapped between two huge mountains of fluffy and soft flesh
>It's a good thing you got used to smell of her sweat and musk while you were under her, because now that smell seems to have intensified
>She starts walking and with every step, you get pulled deeper and deeper into the valley of panda butt you are in
>You keep sinking deeper and deeper until something comes into view
>You see a pink, slightly wrinkled hole Infront of you
>It takes no genius to realize that's what is Infront of you is her butthole
>And that if you sink any deeper, your face will get smoshed right in there, if not sucked in it
>Of course the one person to sit on you happened to be someone not wearing any underwear
>but right before that happens, you realize that everything stopped
>There was no more shaking from movement, or sounds coming from the outside
>Then you feel something grabbing your leg and slowly pulling you out
>You are finally pulled out and start taking lots of deep breaths that you desperately needed
>The hand that was grabbing you from your foot starts moving upwards and backwards until you are put Infront of a face
>Face that belongs to the person that was sitting on you the entire time
>You look at her with a smile that you tried to make look as innocent you can master
>Which guess the pandaren women to smirk 
"You thought you were invisible that entire time~?"
>You change your innocent looking smile into a dumbfounded face
>She knew all along?
"I noticed you the moment I sat down, and was able to figure out what happened after I read the fortune cookie paper you left on the counter"
>She lets go of you foot and have you settle down on her other hand
>You think about what you want to say for a moment, and then ask her if she knew, why didn't she say anything?
>This causes her to smile even wider, but she doesn't say anything this time
>Instead she pulls in you close and kisses you
>A kiss that is covering your entire face
>You can even feel her tongue licking you mouth despite not opening hers
>She finally pulls you away with a loud "mwah~" before speaking to you again
"The effects of this fortune should be gone in a few days. Until then you should stay with me, you'll be safe with meuntil you go back to your normal size"
>You don't get to protest that decision, as she stuffs you between her breasts
"Don't worry little one, I'm sure we will get along like two peas in a pod"
>She says that to you and starts walking away
>...
>You hope that this lasts for more then a few days
