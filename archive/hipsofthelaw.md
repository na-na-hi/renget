Alright I'm gonna start this before heading to bed
>You wake up to find yourself bound with rope inside a jail cell
>This will the last time you ever listened to Rob's idea of a score
>A carriage stick up gone wrong as it was a bait
>Law enforcement came too quickly for your liking and all three of you had to high tail it
>Last thing you felt was someone lassoing you from your horse and something landing on your face
>It all went black after that
>"Well well well... Looks like Sleepin' Beauty finally woke up. Thought I might've had to give you a wake up call."
>Look your right and find a blonde white mouse leaning on the doorway
>Judging by the oversized deputy badge, this must be the sheriff
>A very big hipped sheriff
>"Didn't think the Jade Hunter'll be struttin' down on my roads like that."
"I have a habit of doing that. Who're you suppose to be?"
>The smug mouse walked across the cell, taking care to swing his hips before sitting on your lap
>The sheer weight pressing on your crotch was enough to pull an uncomfortable groan from you
>"Rupert Adson partner, head sheriff of the county you and your bosses were robbin"
>Ah so you were correct- wait bosses?!
"'Scuse me?"
>"Now I know this is a lot to take in your purdy little head so I'm gonna offer you a choice."
"Hold the fuck up why do you think I work under those two idiots?!"
>Rupert was surprised from your outburst before pointing to wanted poster board across
>Anon "Jade Hunter" Moose
>Dead or Alive 100$
>Rib & Rob "Dynamite Twins"
>Dead or Alive 400$
>"Yeah those two have been a pain the neck these past few months. Now I heard they took in some poor soul like you under their wing."
>You took them under your wing because you rescued them from a pack of wolves
>They thought carrying stolen uncontained meat to a town a few miles away was a good idea
>The two basically latched on to you and never let go ever since 
>How in the fuck did they get a higher bounty than you?

"I'm worth more than that! I've robbed more than the robber barons that exploited this county-"
>a finger pushes into your lips, silencing you
>"Shhhshh... I know. I know what it's like being undervalued. Being forced to live a life as an outlaw because of some two bit miscreants."
"Eh chus thus lfe."
>The mouse continues to ignore you and whisper to your ear
>"But don't worry about your life anymore Anon. I value you as a person. In fact you could have a new life right here."
>What
>The mouse pulls back but starts running his hands all over your chest
>"Now I don't usually cut deals with criminals but I can certainly make an exception with you."
>The way he said 'exceptionally' while brushing his fingers along your arms are a bit creepy
>"I don't expect a cute civilian turned outlaw like you to understand but you are dealing with criminals, and criminals need lairs to plan crimes understand?"
"Correct and?"
>The mouse starts gesturing using his hands
>"And so, I need you. To tell me. Where these two are hiding?
"Why are you speakin' slowly?"
>"To make sure. You understand me. Remember this is complicated stuff."
>My fucking god does he think you're retarded?
"Look. I understand. But what's in it for me."
>Rupert lets out a sly smile on his face as he unbuttons your shirt
>"Let's just I'd be willing to absolve all of your crimes. You'll be a free man Anon."
>Huh not a bad deal actually.
"So you're letting me go?"
>The mouse turns a way while letting an exaggerated thinking face
>"Mmmm. Not quite. You'll be absolved but you'll have to be housed in a location with a registered officer under the same roof."
"That's just prison with a different name."
>"Is it really a prison? When you have someone to take care of you? Of all your needs~"
>The sheriff is now fully laying on top of your chest, giving you the biggest bedroom eyes.
>Ok this is getting too weird for your liking, the two idiots should've been busted you out now

>"You sure this is the right buildin' Rob?"
>"Sure as gold. This where they was keepin' the boss man."
>Rob prepped the explosive against the wall, making sure they stick
>"Alright, that's the last dynamite we need to a blow a hole in this sucker!"
>Lighting a match with his boot, Rob lit the fuse and ran away with Rib in tow.
>BOOM!

>The cell was rocked from the explosion pulling the sheriff out of his stupor 
>"What in tarnation?!"
>Rupert wiped drool from his mouth and walked off to investigate
>Leaving you tied up on the floor with a bunch of hickies on your neck
"God I hope those two didn't just make it any worse."

>"Alright hands up copper! We want our boss back and there ain't nothin' you can do about it!"
>Their explosive high was cut short when they noticed the 'office' was full of overturned canned food and vegetables
>The pig anthro on the desk was shaking his boots with his hands up on the air
>Rib pulled out the town map and turned it upside down, giving the perfect orientation
>"Oops."
>The mouse gets hit on the back of the head by his partner
>"Yeah oops! We just wasted good dynamite on the wrong wall!"
>"Well I didn't cause the boss man to get arrested because 'I want to give him a good score so he could plow me like I'm a fertile land' huh!"
>"I at least try to scope out new opportunities for us ya dunce!"
>The bickering was cut short as the door to the store was kicked open, giving entrance to one pissed off white mouse.
>"Well if ain't the dynamite twins."
>Rupert spat on the nearby spittoon
>"I should've known since there was the distinct stench you two cause that was ruining my good time with Anon."
>The two drew their guns on the sheriff, with the latter drawing his own on them
>"Where you hidin' Jade Hunter and why are you saying a 'good time'?"
>"You heard me. It's time I pulled out that poor sop away from your grubby dirty hands and help live a life of which a gentleman deserves."

>Rib visibly gasps before sniffing the air, his nose twitching erratically 
>"You've been schmoozing with our boss man!"
>Rob's ears pulled back as he hissed at Rupert who had a bemused look.
>"Ain't no cute nickname for your hostage gonna deter me from taking him off you ya snakes."

>Meanwhile, you were currently worm crawling slowly towards the butter knife on the table
>Using all your upper body strength, you got on to your knees and leaned on the table top
>Your tongue slowly pulling it back and it gets knocked on to the floor
>Positing your back to it, your fingers felt the metal silverware and grabbed it
>Slowly and carefully, you used a sawing motion with as much your dexterous digits can handle
>You think about how Rib and Rob are handling the sheriff right now

>"WELL AT LEAST WE ASK FOR HIS CONSENT! YOU'RE JUST A LONELY CREEP WHO ABUSES HIS AUTHORITY!"
>"CREEP?! I'M NOT THE ONE WHO RELIES ON FAKE DRESSES TO SEDUCE THAT FELLER!"
>Rupert emphasizes his point by squatting and slapping his hips with his guns
>"See this?! These hips molds bad boys into good men!"
>Rob guffawed and turned around to spread his legs apart
>"As if! Our boss man, no matter what he says, always returns to plow us because we are that good!"
>"Well Anon hasn't exactly touched you for a week ever since that snake oil incident."
>"Not the time Rib!"
