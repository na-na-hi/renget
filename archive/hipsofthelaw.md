Alright I'm gonna start this before heading to bed
>You wake up to find yourself bound with rope inside a jail cell
>This will the last time you ever listened to Rob's idea of a score
>A carriage stick up gone wrong as it was a bait
>Law enforcement came too quickly for your liking and all three of you had to high tail it
>Last thing you felt was someone lassoing you from your horse and something landing on your face
>It all went black after that
>"Well well well... Looks like Sleepin' Beauty finally woke up. Thought I might've had to give you a wake up call."
>Look your right and find a blonde white mouse leaning on the doorway
>Judging by the oversized deputy badge, this must be the sheriff
>A very big hipped sheriff
>"Didn't think the Jade Hunter'll be struttin' down on my roads like that."
"I have a habit of doing that. Who're you suppose to be?"
>The smug mouse walked across the cell, taking care to swing his hips before sitting on your lap
>The sheer weight pressing on your crotch was enough to pull an uncomfortable groan from you
>"Rupert Adson partner, head sheriff of the county you and your bosses were robbin"
>Ah so you were correct- wait bosses?!
"'Scuse me?"
>"Now I know this is a lot to take in your purdy little head so I'm gonna offer you a choice."
"Hold the fuck up why do you think I work under those two idiots?!"
>Rupert was surprised from your outburst before pointing to wanted poster board across
>Anon "Jade Hunter" Moose
>Dead or Alive 100$
>Rib & Rob "Dynamite Twins"
>Dead or Alive 400$
>"Yeah those two have been a pain the neck these past few months. Now I heard they took in some poor soul like you under their wing."
>You took them under your wing because you rescued them from a pack of wolves
>They thought carrying stolen uncontained meat to a town a few miles away was a good idea
>The two basically latched on to you and never let go ever since 
>How in the fuck did they get a higher bounty than you?

"I'm worth more than that! I've robbed more than the robber barons that exploited this county-"
>a finger pushes into your lips, silencing you
>"Shhhshh... I know. I know what it's like being undervalued. Being forced to live a life as an outlaw because of some two bit miscreants."
"Eh chus thus lfe."
>The mouse continues to ignore you and whisper to your ear
>"But don't worry about your life anymore Anon. I value you as a person. In fact you could have a new life right here."
>What
>The mouse pulls back but starts running his hands all over your chest
>"Now I don't usually cut deals with criminals but I can certainly make an exception with you."
>The way he said 'exceptionally' while brushing his fingers along your arms are a bit creepy
>"I don't expect a cute civilian turned outlaw like you to understand but you are dealing with criminals, and criminals need lairs to plan crimes understand?"
"Correct and?"
>The mouse starts gesturing using his hands
>"And so, I need you. To tell me. Where these two are hiding?
"Why are you speakin' slowly?"
>"To make sure. You understand me. Remember this is complicated stuff."
>My fucking god does he think you're retarded?
"Look. I understand. But what's in it for me."
>Rupert lets out a sly smile on his face as he unbuttons your shirt
>"Let's just I'd be willing to absolve all of your crimes. You'll be a free man Anon."
>Huh not a bad deal actually.
"So you're letting me go?"
>The mouse turns a way while letting an exaggerated thinking face
>"Mmmm. Not quite. You'll be absolved but you'll have to be housed in a location with a registered officer under the same roof."
"That's just prison with a different name."
>"Is it really a prison? When you have someone to take care of you? Of all your needs~"
>The sheriff is now fully laying on top of your chest, giving you the biggest bedroom eyes.
>Ok this is getting too weird for your liking, the two idiots should've been busted you out now

>"You sure this is the right buildin' Rob?"
>"Sure as gold. This where they was keepin' the boss man."
>Rob prepped the explosive against the wall, making sure they stick
>"Alright, that's the last dynamite we need to a blow a hole in this sucker!"
>Lighting a match with his boot, Rob lit the fuse and ran away with Rib in tow.
>BOOM!

>The cell was rocked from the explosion pulling the sheriff out of his stupor 
>"What in tarnation?!"
>Rupert wiped drool from his mouth and walked off to investigate
>Leaving you tied up on the floor with a bunch of hickies on your neck
"God I hope those two didn't just make it any worse."

>"Alright hands up copper! We want our boss back and there ain't nothin' you can do about it!"
>Their explosive high was cut short when they noticed the 'office' was full of overturned canned food and vegetables
>The pig anthro on the desk was shaking his boots with his hands up on the air
>Rib pulled out the town map and turned it upside down, giving the perfect orientation
>"Oops."
>The mouse gets hit on the back of the head by his partner
>"Yeah oops! We just wasted good dynamite on the wrong wall!"
>"Well I didn't cause the boss man to get arrested because 'I want to give him a good score so he could plow me like I'm a fertile land' huh!"
>"I at least try to scope out new opportunities for us ya dunce!"
>The bickering was cut short as the door to the store was kicked open, giving entrance to one pissed off white mouse.
>"Well if ain't the dynamite twins."
>Rupert spat on the nearby spittoon
>"I should've known since there was the distinct stench you two cause that was ruining my good time with Anon."
>The two drew their guns on the sheriff, with the latter drawing his own on them
>"Where you hidin' Jade Hunter and why are you saying a 'good time'?"
>"You heard me. It's time I pulled out that poor sop away from your grubby dirty hands and help live a life of which a gentleman deserves."

>Rib visibly gasps before sniffing the air, his nose twitching erratically 
>"You've been schmoozing with our boss man!"
>Rob's ears pulled back as he hissed at Rupert who had a bemused look.
>"Ain't no cute nickname for your hostage gonna deter me from taking him off you ya snakes."

>Meanwhile, you were currently worm crawling slowly towards the butter knife on the table
>Using all your upper body strength, you got on to your knees and leaned on the table top
>Your tongue slowly pulling it back and it gets knocked on to the floor
>Positing your back to it, your fingers felt the metal silverware and grabbed it
>Slowly and carefully, you used a sawing motion with as much your dexterous digits can handle
>You think about how Rib and Rob are handling the sheriff right now

>"WELL AT LEAST WE ASK FOR HIS CONSENT! YOU'RE JUST A LONELY CREEP WHO ABUSES HIS AUTHORITY!"
>"CREEP?! I'M NOT THE ONE WHO RELIES ON FAKE DRESSES TO SEDUCE THAT FELLER!"
>Rupert emphasizes his point by squatting and slapping his hips with his guns
>"See this?! These hips molds bad boys into good men!"
>Rob guffawed and turned around to spread his legs apart
>"As if! Our boss man, no matter what he says, always returns to plow us because we are that good!"
>"Well Anon hasn't exactly touched you for a week ever since that snake oil incident."
>"Not the time Rib!"

>Ok you got your arms free
>You lay on your side as you lean forward to reach for your tied up legs
>Your hands could barely reach to the sides of your ankles with the knife
>Just a little closer
>Sucking in your gut to make more room to lean in, the tip of the blade was now touching the rope
>However, you see the door to the outside open with the mouse sheriff looking mighty pissed
>You drop the knife immediately and put your hands in the air
" I can assure you this isn't an escape and I'm innocent of everything."
>He locks eyes on you and starts stomping towards your prone form
>For once, you felt scared on what he was going to do to you
>Until the pear-shaped mouse lands his tush against your face with hesitation
>"How about we settle this for real then boys?!"
>You could hear Rupert talk to someone but his voice is muffled by the sheer amount of ass
>A set of footsteps approached you two
>"You're on! I think Boss man Anon will fucking enjoy our bodies more than you pig!"
>Was that Rob's voice?
>"Yeah! After this, he'll be permanently allergic to a government bootlicker like you! 
>And Rib's?
>Did- did these fuckers sell you out!

>The human below Sheriff Rupert continued to throw punches in the air, the mouse delicately removed Anon's pants
>As soon as the beast was exposed, all three of the mice's nose twitch in the air
>They sniffed about, taking in the musky smell before settling on the twitching cock laid down on Anon's crotch
>Their faces squeezed together on one spot to inhale the male scent that was driving them insane
>"His cock~"
>"So manly~"
>"Anon~!"
>Their mouths dove in to different spots to get a taste of the outlaw's sausage

>You stopped your struggling as soon as you felt three mouths hungrily devour your exposed head, shaft, and balls respectively
>The sheriff's fat ass above you pressed down lending your hot breath to tickle his anus
>Fuck the mouse was so heavy you could feel his cheeks melding with your head
>You tried grab his waste to pull him off but it was no use
>The heat on your face and the sensation below was keeping you from concentrating
>You hate to admit it but they were sucking you off good

>Back to the trio, Rib was busy suckling on your testicles like a babe, feeling your impending orgasm
>Rupert was busy shaft like a tender lover, kissing and sucking on it all over
>Rob was on your tip like a possessed beast, weeks on not getting off led to him slobbering on your tip
>Despite the three's opposite reputations, they were like a machine trying to get you off 
>Rupert was the first to stop his ministrations and nuzzled on your stem
>"H-Had enough? I could go all day."
>Rob could only look down at the sheriff to give him the middle finger
>Rib lets go of Anon's coin purse and sniffed on it like an addict
>"H-He's close. I could feel him."
>That kicked the other two into working Anon's cock harder
>Each of their dicks twitched in anticipation as well, one hand over their own guns to fire off like a firing squad

>Fuck so close
>And to think, the two bastards under your wing sold you off 
>Now you're probably going to be sex slave to some creep mouse who's too lonely for his own good
>The mouth on your tip stopped slobbering and just sucking on your head like a barnacle
>That was enough to set you off
>With a single thrust, you feel somehow the mouth swallow all of your length and cum inside inside its throat

>"Mother of god, Rob!"
>Rib could only watch as his brother suddenly took your entire shaft and swallow all of its load
>Rupert felt cheated but nonetheless enjoyed the overwhelmed face of his rival
>One of Rob's eyes closed as he felt Anon's load deposit into his throat, some leaking on his nostrils
>Perseverance pushed into his mind and pulled away. Alongside his orgasm drooling all over the floor
>He coughed up the excess semen but realized what had he just did
>"Afhh! Hfs cfm!"
>The panicked mouse started licking away all the wasted cum on the floor
>"Hah! Lightweight."
>The white mouse graciously licked all over the fluids that surround the softening member
>He sucked on to the tip, wanting drink the rest of the load
>Rib pointed at the smug mouse
>"Y-You cheated!"
>"Oh please, I'm not the one who bit more than he could swallow."

>God, that felt good
>Too good
>Whatever's on the other end of what happened, at least some of your frustration is gone now
>The weight on your face is lifted and light floods your vision
>You see Rib looking angrily at the sheriff, said sheriff is standing tall mocking the two mice
>Rob is... what ever the hell he is doing
>"Now if you'll excuse me, I'll be claiming my prize~"
>The sheriff walked over you and positioned his butt on your lap
>You on the other hand, were focused on the two traitors
"Rib... Rob... You rats!"
>You coughed up from the sudden intake of air and Rib was suddenly at your side
>"Boss! Boss! Please, just focus on me! Whatever you do, don't turn to the light of the law!"
"What in the sam hill are you talkin' about?!"
>The feeling of warmth enveloping your sensitive cock cuts your mind off 

>Rupert could only smile in ecstasy as at last the handsome outlaw's cock was inside him
>He bit his lip as his ass pulled away from just Anon's tip before descending again with a loud clap
>Each bounce earned him a firm tug on his prostate and a groan from his soon mister

>Shit
>Shit!
>He feels way too tight and hotter than these two idiots
>Now that offer from earlier was starting to get tempting
>"Boss! Remember the light! Turn away!"
>Goddammit Rib shut up for once! You're tired and horny and you want all of this to end right now!
>You grab the sheriffs ass and pulled up to meet his big cheeks
>He practically sings as he wasn't expecting you to fight back
>"No! Rob what do I do? He's starting to fall for the sheriff!"
>Said mouse currently on the floor recovering from getting choked by the excess cum
>"R-Remind him the good times we *urf* had!"
>"Hey boss! Remember the snake oil incident?"
>Such a reminder just made you angrier, specifically at Rob, and started thrusting up harder
>"Not that one! Another memory!"
>"R-Remember that time you and me with the dress-"
>Actually you did and you are tired of whatever these two were doing right now
>You grab Rib by the back of his head and mash your lips against his to shut him up
>The mouse's hand went on to jerk himself off as he made out with you

>Once again, Rob felt he was excluded in another sex session out of spite

>"Ah~ Y-Ya gettin' close handsome? Don't think I'm gonna be a dead fish compared to these two!"
>Rupert's ass continued to jackhammer on your waist while his erect penis was starting to shake
>His mind was starting to get mushy on what else this stud's gonna do when he brings him home
>Anon's cock continue to rib through his cavern and bring out more sensations he couldn't possibly know
>He could practically feel him starting to twitch again
>His ass planted himself on his crotch and started gyrating
>Anon chocked on Rib's mouth and pulled away as he shook with another orgasm

>You shot your first load deep within Rupert's ass, your tip rearranging his guts and spreading its seed all over
>Even you felt his orgasm as well as he straightened up while he came hands free
>Rib finally was able to get his release as he shot his load on to the floor as well, panting from the lack of air
>Rupert hiccuped from the excess cum on his stomach as fell backwards and landed on your chest
>His hand reached for your chin and tickled it with a smile on his face
>"'See? I told you I could handle ya?"
>Rib sidled up towards your face and nuzzled next to you
>While Rob just hobbled next to you and took his brother's opposite side
>All of you lied down there for a few minutes just savoring each other's company
>You cut off the silence with a question
"All of you had fun?"
>All three of them nodded with smiles on their faces
"Good."
>You grab Rib's ear and Rupert's hair with your left, and Rob's ear with your right
>All of them had a sudden emotion of fear in their face
>"Uh oh."

>The townsfolk could only watch with curiosity as they heard slapping sounds outside of the sheriff's office
>All of them thought it was  some dastardly criminal getting punished for their crimes

>You give another hard slap on Rib's ass with a paddle
>"Gah!"
>The three horny mice were strung up like skinned pigs with their asses exposed in front of you
>"A-Ah thought we had something special Anon?! Don't you want to get away from these two hooligans?"
>Wood hits Rupert's bottom instantly
>"Ngah!
"Tell them Rib."
>"He- He's our boss! He was the one who planned our robberies, thefts, cons *WACK* everything!"
>Even though the red sore on his ass was growing, his cock continued to leak out precum
>Bastards were starting to enjoy this
>"H-How!? I thought an upstanding human like you- *WACK* Neugh!"
>That one made him spurt out a few strings
"Next time, don't assume some 'weak' human to be following orders from these two idiots."
>"Guh... Can you at least hit me harder boss~?"
>Rob had a thick puddle of semen building up below him
"No. You enjoy this too much"
