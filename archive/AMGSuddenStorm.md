#Sudden Storm

The sun hadn't yet peeked over the horizon, and the birds had only just began their fervent, daily search for food. One Furijo Misao found herself stuffed into a school uniform and herded over to her dining table. In her half awake daze, she blankly stared at the traditional breakfast laid out before her.

A stern, high pitch voice calmly commanded her: "Hurry up and eat, Misao. We need to head out soon"

Too tired to think about it, Misao lifted the bowl of miso soup and took a sip: "Ooh, breakfast is kinda delicious today."

The stern voice softened slightly: "E... Er... You're very welcome. Glad you liked it."

Misao happily took another sip when her body shook, the soup almost going down into her lungs. As she coughed and spat, she managed to cried out: "W-w-w-WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING HERE!?"

Opposite to Misao sat the new bane of her existence- a pint sized squirt with long silver hair named Tsukishiro Arika. In contrast to Misao's full breakfast set, Arika merely had an earthenware teacup filled with green tea. As if her presence here was the most natural thing in the world, she calmly sampled her tea.

Once Misao finished her coughing fit, Arika provided her explanation: "The duties of the student council require that we arrive before anyone else does. As a result, I was asked to drop by on the way to school to ensure you leave at an appropriate time. I had time to spare while Chieka-san woke you up, so I helped Furijo-san prepare your breakfast."

From this information provided to her, Misao surmised that Chieka (the babysitter sent by Amaterasu), her grandmother, and Arika had conspired to thoroughly ruin her life. When she glanced over at the clock on the wall that read '5:15', she then knew that the only sane person in this shrine was her.

As she scooped up some rice and fish with her chopsticks, Misao grumbled before eating: "*Sigh* My life is so over. What did I do to deserve this...?"

Arika's voice quickly lost it's softness: "Worry not, I'll only disturb your precious sleep when it's our turn for morning duties. I have my own schedule to keep after all."

Comforted in knowing that not every day would start like this, Misao once again took a sip of her miso soup: "Mm... This really is good though..."

"......Glad you like it" - Arika's voice had once again softened.

***

After doing her utmost to stall the inevitable, Misao was finally tossed out of her house and forced to commence her 'student council duties'. As she made her way to school, Arika and Chieka flanked her on either side, as if they were prison wardens ensuring a prisoner wouldn't escape. With how tired she felt, she almost felt as if her soul would leave her body with every step of the short journey. 

Curiously, Misao spotted what seemed to be a kindred spirit further down the road. There stood a red haired gyaru in an unfamiliar school uniform, her expression a prime example of resting bitch face. Between the jewelry hanging from her body, the skirt that had been intentionally shortened, the cleavage pouring out from her partially unbuttoned blouse, and the (surprisingly light) make-up adorning her face, Misao could confidently say that no school in the city would actually let their students dress like that. (If such a school existed, she'd have done everything in her power to attend.)

The gyaru boldly walked over and scanned Misao up and down: "Hey, so, I'm Mirai. I'mma go to a mixer with some friends, but somebody ditched last minute- kinda lame since now we don't have enough girls. You look cool. Wanna come?"

At the thought of attending a mixer instead of classes, Misao's smile widened so far it seemed it might split her face open. However, before she could pounce on such a wonderful opportunity, two cold and judgmental glares bored into her back, curtesy of Arika and Chieka. It quickly became apparent that such a lovely dream would remain a dream- the dull, cruel embrace of lectures and pop quizzes awaited her.

Misao bitterly replied: "Believe me, I'd love to, but with these two riding my ass they'd probably call the cops and ruin the mixer."

"K." Mirai shrugged and turned around, walking away without another word. She pulled her cell phone out and began to fiddle around with it as she walked down the street.

Misao turned to face her wardens and heaved a sigh. Although, she couldn't help but wonder- would the kind of girl that skips school for a mixer really be awake at this hour?

***

Upon arriving at school, it finally dawned on Misao that she didn't even know what 'duties' she was supposed to perform. Arika quickly filled her in- they were to stand outside the school gate and make sure the students walking in were wearing the uniforms properly. As a repeat offender, Misao never expected to be on the other side of this particular form of tyranny... Not to mention that she never really read the school handbook, so the actual rules were foreign to her. On the flip side, that also didn't really matter- she wasn't going to help. The students most likely to break the rules are the ones she's most likely going to make friends with. Making trouble for them would just be shooting herself in the foot.

While Misao enjoyed her beautiful dreams, Arika made sure to crush them: "Incidentally, every day there's at least a few students that are very obviously ignoring the dress code, so don't think of pretending not to see anything. If you do, I'll be sure to pass that information along. Even if you didn't read the handbook, it'll still be quite obvious."

Compared to Arika, Misao was started to miss Chieka. At least that divine babysitter was easier to trick: "Bleh, it's unfair. I'm out here in the cold morning air and Chieka gets to hide inside the school building."

Ever prepared, Arika quickly replied: "If you feel cold, you should remember to carry a handwarmer."

As Arika held out and pointed to a handwarmer, Misao grumpily spat: "Well duh, that's just common sense. It's not like it's THAT cold though. Handwarmers are just overkill."

Arika turned her head away and muttered quietly: "Then good, it's not like I brought a spare handwarmer for you anyway..."

Both girls were, of course, lying through their teeth. Misao would have happily taken a handwarmer but assumed Arika was only showing off. Arika meticulously brought a spare handwarmer in case Misao wanted one, but didn't want to be pushy.

As time passed, students finally started to arrive, and every now and then Arika would call out to a student and remind them of the dress code. Ear piercings, shortened skirts, make-up, etc- in each and every case, Arika would have the offending student remedy their uniform, and in each and every case Misao wondered what the point was when the student would just go back to violating the dress code as soon as they entered the school building.

Eventually, Misao saw an opportunity to pretend she was working- she waved over to an nerdy looking girl with thick glasses and a lab coat: "Hey! Hey, you in the lab coat. I'm pretty sure lab coats are against the dress code."

As the lab coat wearing girl walked over, Arika cut in before Misao could continue: "Oddly enough, she isn't breaking the dress code. That lab coat is technically considered part of the school uniform, similar to track jerseys. Although it was only intended for use in chemistry classes and similar clubs, wearing it to school isn't against any rules."

Arika then sifted through the student registry and addressed the girl in the lab coat: "Sorry about that, ah... Fujii-senpai. Please head on inside. You haven't broken any rules."

The girl in the lab coat, Fumie Fujii, cheerily smiled before heading inside: "No worries Ari-chan, Misa-chan, it's an easy mistake. Having to stand around out here must be tiring. Would you like something to drink?"

Before Misao could accept, Arika declined: "No need senpai, I already have drinks prepared."

As Fumie nodded and returned to her own business, Misao glanced over: "Since you declined for both of us, you'd better have a drink for me too. I was going to say yes."

Reaching into her bag, Arika pulled out two bottles of tea, only for her spare handwarmer to get dragged out and fall onto the ground. Misao flatly questions her: "...I thought you said you didn't have a spare handwarmer?"

Arika faces away from Misao, but her ears turn a faint scarlet: "...You said it was overkill... Um... Would you like a handwarmer...?"

Off to the side, Fumie had happily pulled out her camera, taking a precious picture of the two student council members sharing tea and handwarmers. It seemed that the two girls were getting along better, and it warmed her heart to see.

Eventually, Misao's job of checking for uniform violations ended, and she managed to appease Arika's sense of duty. Once class was in session, Misao finally had the chance to rest her weary legs. While the desire to skip school lingered, she took some solace in the fact that her situation could be worse- she could be stuck standing outside the classroom carrying two buckets... Clearly her homeroom teacher was a stickler for being on time. 

Misao pondered for a moment: "Wait, are schools even still allowed to hand out punishments like that? Eeh. Still, I kinda feel bad for that girl... Yuzu, was it? I wonder who has it worse, me for arriving early and having to wait around or her for arriving late?"

...

The rest of the school day went by peacefully. Misao even had the chance to play around after school- apparently morning duties in the student council meant not having anything to do in the afternoon that day. She mused to herself that it would be nice if her magical girl duties were as reasonable.

***

As night drew a gloomy curtain across the town, the two young heroes reconvened near the business side of town. Lately, the electricity nearby had been going haywire and Arika's divination had confirmed the presence of another yokai. The sounds of their footsteps and chatter sounded out in the night air.

Not even attempting to hide her utter lack of concern, Misao let loose a complaint: "Bleh, what a pain. To think I could be at a nice café right now. Instead I'm in the boring side of town, risking my neck for some weird old men in suits."

Arika replied with a straight face: "Those 'weird old men in suits' are the reason why the shops on the main street can function. Would you prefer that the cafés and clothing stores went out of business?"

Misao clicked her tongue: "...No, I wouldn't."

Arika continued, an annoyed frown adorning her lips: "However, I do agree that I'd rather be in a café. I've got another test tomorrow, and I'd rather be studying. How nice it would be if the gods didn't push this work on students."

With a tilt of her head, Misao couldn't help but voice her confusion: "What does studying have to do with cafés?"

Both girls halted their steps and stared at each other blankly. The brief silence eventually broken by Arika: "A nice, quiet café is a great place to study. You and your friends should try it some time."

Misao took a moment to process that advice when a glint of blue flashed across the street- the yokai had appeared!

![Thunder Weasel](https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/f/b04de266-f700-4fde-a869-181e8dd76920/da5n71t-6c73f34d-127e-4b16-81cf-699c70e3ec62.png?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1cm46YXBwOjdlMGQxODg5ODIyNjQzNzNhNWYwZDQxNWVhMGQyNmUwIiwiaXNzIjoidXJuOmFwcDo3ZTBkMTg4OTgyMjY0MzczYTVmMGQ0MTVlYTBkMjZlMCIsIm9iaiI6W1t7InBhdGgiOiJcL2ZcL2IwNGRlMjY2LWY3MDAtNGZkZS1hODY5LTE4MWU4ZGQ3NjkyMFwvZGE1bjcxdC02YzczZjM0ZC0xMjdlLTRiMTYtODFjZi02OTljNzBlM2VjNjIucG5nIn1dXSwiYXVkIjpbInVybjpzZXJ2aWNlOmZpbGUuZG93bmxvYWQiXX0.nILbIar4Q4cZEIx-GHkesWfL8kb_B9HcH06MJ57bJPA)

Happy to end their hunt as soon as possible, Arika and Misao raced after the small weasel clad in crackling blue sparks. Like some kind of living bouncy ball, the weasel jumped from place to place, leaving a dull blue light trail of light behind. Arika and Misao both made attempts to strike the small beast down, but neither Arika's flying slashes nor Misao's fiery spells managed to connect- the only casualty thus far was the signpost of a small office building, now reduced to a slightly burnt pile of trash on the sidewalk. Clearly, the beast was determined to flee, and the narrow streets between office buildings suited it too well.

Misao was getting more and more frustrated by the moment: "Damn it, get back here you stupid rat!"

Arika felt similarly impatient, but curbed her frustrations: "If we keep chasing, we'll corner it eventually. We just need to make sure we don't let it slip away when the time comes."

Misao did little more to reply than clench her teeth in vexation- clearly she wasn't satisfied by such a strategy, but lacked a good alternative.

As the group exited one alleyway and entered a wider street, Misao's eyes glistened with a simple scheme- since the weasel was relying on the alleyways to escape, she should just target the entrance to the nearest alleyway! Why wait for an opportunity when she could just create one? With a swing of her Gohei, a fireball raced forward, exploding in front of the alleyway across the street. The weasel however, made a sharp turn in response, crashing into the window of a nearby warehouse. Misao rushed in after it, smugly satisfied in cornering the beast. 

Arika on the other hand hesitated for a moment: (...It's mana... Why did it look like the weasel was headed to the window to begin with? Did it predict Misao's attack? Or...)

However, Arika lacked the leisure to continue that train of thought- Misao had already dived into the warehouse. Lightly stepping off from the ground, Arika leapt into the broken window. Inside, she was greeted to the sight of the blue weasel darting around the warehouse while Misao stood in the middle of the room, wildly flailing her gohei around in an attempt to bombard it with her spells. Her left shoulder already bore a faint new scorch mark, showing that the weasel was no longer content to keep fleeing.

Misao quickly noticed Arika: "Arika, hurry up and help me. I've already got it cornered!"

Arika nodded and ran over to her: "Got it. I'll try to pin it down with my magic. Please keep it busy!"

With a fat stack of talismans in her off hand, Misao grinned: "Easy peasy. I'll finish this in one go!"

Their simple plan settled on, Misao kept up her assault while Arika began to channel mana for her spell. The weasel however took this moment to change tactics- it rushed for the broken window! Unwilling to resume the chase from earlier, Misao panicked and once again attempted to head off it's exit with a torrent of fire. Yet the weasel immediately changed directions again, this time barreling straight towards Misao! As she dashed to the side and turned to keep track of the weasel, Misao immediately realized her mistake- Arika was right behind her!

As Misao tried to quickly call out, Arika shouted: "Misao, do it!"

Gritting her teeth, Misao set her mana ablaze and tossed out dozens of talismans. Meanwhile, Arika held her blade out horizontally and pressed the flat of the sword against her left palm, while her hair and clothes began to waver as if a suddenly weightless.

"Burn to a crisp! Solar Array!" "Kneel before the moon! Gravity Well!"

A pale blue circle centered on Arika lit up, pressing down on the area around her. In front of Arika lay three circles of blazing talismans, each circle floating overtop the other. The weasel, unable to change directions mid-jump, dived straight into the intersection of these circles. Unable to escape under the crushing weight of gravity, it released a mournful cry before being engulfed in a crimson column of fire.

As the fire dispersed and she could confirm the weasel's demise, Misao sighed in relief: "Glad THAT'S over. Stupid thing just wouldn't stop moving- and how did you react so fast? Did you know it would do that?"

Arika however was still tense, warily scanning the warehouse: "I did. Before, when you drove it in here, I noticed that it was heading to that window before you even attacked. Since it was more intelligent than it let on, I decided to bet on it trying to trick you, but I don't know why it wanted to go in this warehouse, so don't let-"

Misao lazily stretched out her arms when Arika suddenly tackled her, knocking her onto her butt. Before she could process what happened, Misao's eyes widened in terror- where she had been standing, where Arika should have been, there was instead a roaring, blood-red, beam of lightning.

"ARIKA!", Misao screamed.

As the beam faded, Misao spotted Arika pressed against the wall of the warehouse, her body scorched and limp as she flopped onto the ground with a dull 'thud'. Jerking her head to the side, Misao then saw the assassin in question- a graceful, crimson haired woman with a spear wearing samurai-esque armor. While her smile seemed gentle enough, the potent aura pouring out from her body conveyed only murderous intent.

![The Crimson Flash Warlord, Benihime](https://safebooru.org//images/4195/06d8fbac339b3ff6ee14c3f255ed844fc34b7bb4.png?4381648) 

Fear. Between Arika's uncertain fate and the overwhelming pressure coming from the crimson woman, Misao only felt terror. As her breathing quickened and heart beat faster and faster, she stopped thinking and her instincts kicked in- she herself wasn't even sure why of all things, she returned to where she was standing only a moment ago! Misao stood between the woman and the injured Arika, preparing to gamble everything at once. The chant for her ultimate move was already slipping past her lips as her mind began to process her own actions.

The woman however stood leisurely, as if happy to let Misao prepare her strongest move: "Welcome to the battlefield, little ones. I am the Crimson Flash Warlord, Benihime- take care to remember that on your way to hell."

Arika remained slumped over, with a dull gleam of mana pulsing through her eyes: (...I... Can't move... why...)

Even as Misao chant continued, Benihime only continued to chatter on: "I serve the vile gods, and on their behalf I lead Yokai to return the world to it's natural state of chaos."

Her eyes starting to regain focus, Arika looked up towards Misao: (...Misao... No... Stop... You can't...)

Benihime maintained her confident, gentle grin, while Arika bitterly struggled to at least cry out- Misao completed her chant: "Blessed Land of Amaterasu!"

The better half of the warehouse was lit up in purifying, holy flames, and Benihime's figure dissolved into the light. A whisper floated over from behind Misao: "...and for the sake of chaos, you little ones are in the way..." -Misao's hair stood on edge, fully expecting her death.

Misao weakly turned around with what little strength remained. Two streams of tears fells from her eyes as she stumbled forward to reached out- the woman was standing over Arika, spear held up! With her mana overdrawn, Misao could only watch on as Benihime's brought down the spear.

*DING*

A sharp, metallic sound rung in Misao's ears, immediately followed by a dull crunch- Benihime's spear had missed its mark and pierced the warehouse wall instead! As Benihime jerked her head to the side, Misao followed her line of sight, seeing yet another magical girl hurtling through the air from the broken window and headed directly for Benihime. This new girl was clad in a vibrant blue outfit and carried an ancient, weathered blade at her side.

By the time Benihime had withdrawn her spear from the wall, the blue-clad girl had already arrived. She swung her sword, to which Benihime parried, borrowing the momentum to retreat. The moment her feet graced the earth, Benihime immediately plunged forward, spear wrapped in crimson lightning!

And yet the blue-clad girl didn't seem to notice the incoming attack- in fact she wasn't even looking at it: "I can feel the wind. Your illusions won't work! Serpent Slaying Dance- Totsuka!"

Wind began to swirl around the blue-clad girl like a tornado as she rushed straight ahead, ignoring the incoming spear. Benihime's figure in turn faded into nothing on contact with the violent storm. Instead, the blue-clad girl's sword found it's target amidst thin air, once again giving rise to a sharp, metallic clang, revealing Benihime's true location. This time, there was no room for retreat- attacks of all kinds, from a flurry of swords strikes, to blades of wind, to kicks and more assaulted Benihime from all sides. It seemed as if the only option left for her was to block and parry until her defeat. Even her trusted illusions were meaningless under the sharp senses of her opponent.

And yet, as leisurely as ever, Benihime sighed: "How troublesome. You've got me this time- I didn't think the little ones had help. It seems we'll have to continue this another day."

The blue-clad girl roared in outrage: "Why wait? For a villain like you, it's better to end things here and now!"

Benihime simply gave one final, gentle smile, before a bolt of crimson lighting pierced the ceiling of the warehouse and crashed down on her, leaving the blue-clad girl's assault with nothing to strike. Benihime had vanished, with only one final whisper floating down: "...Don't be impatient, I have all the time in the world. When I find the right moment... You won't feel a thing..."

Dissatisfied, but clearly unable to locate her foe, the blue-clad girl turned to Misao and Arika: "Hey there, I came to save you! Storm Princess, Mitarai Chie, at your service."

Not one to wait around, Chie walked over to Arika, prompting a response from Misao: "Arika! Is... Is she OK?"

Chie calmly replied: "No worries, she's still breathing"

Noting that Arika had even remained conscious, Chie knelt down to her with a smile and whispered: "I'm sure that was difficult- being powerless to do anything is always painful... But it's OK. You just need to get stronger. I can help with that..."

Arika naturally didn't respond. Chie gently watched over the two as they took a moment to recover, physically and mentally. For quite a while, the only sound was Misao's sobbing- a mixture of "thank you"s "I'm sorry"s and "don't scare me like that"s rattled off from her lips in a chaotic, tangled mess of words that even she herself barely understood. In return, Arika only managed to push out one small sentence before passing out...

"...Then... Next time I'll be strong enough to save us both..."

Misao nearly choked on her works: "You... It's not just you fighting, dummy... You really need to learn how to rely on others... to rely on me... Don't forget that I'm the onee-san here."

...

Sensing that this wasn't the time for pleasantries, Chie saw the two back to their homes and let them rest properly.

***

Later that night...

Atop a four story office building not far from the warehouse that contained the battle from earlier, a gyaru sat with her back against the rooftop doorway and her legs lazily crossed. Her name was Mukawa Mirai, the girl that invited Misao to a truant mixer early in the morning.

As she fiddled with her phone, she lazily called out into the crisp night breeze: "Heya boss, enjoy the show?"

A blurry figure came into focus, as if emerging from the shadows. It was a human looking, female yokai clad in strange, blue, full-body armor. Her magical aura was extremely subtle, yet what little it showed reeked of death and despair. 

Perhaps out of confidence, or simply arrogance, the strange yokai didn't deign to look at Mirai as she responded: "Yes, you played your part precisely, down to the letter. I hope your future performances are as dramatic. Mmhmhm, the look on the fire princess's face when you made your arrival was exquisite."

Mirai, or rather Benihime kept her head turned down at her phone: "I'd rather not have my head mounted on the great yokai Shikyou's sword, so I'll do my best."

... Noting that said 'Shikyou' wasn't replying, Benihime continued on: "Still, next time will be harder. The silver haired girl was easy to trick- All I had to do was target her friend and she self-destructed. Next time she'll be on guard, and that eye of hers will be trouble... Ahh... Maybe I really should have killed her, those eyes are way too dangerous..."

Shikyou cheerily interrupted: "Don't even think about it, Beni. Killing them now would be too easy. Too boring! Such a performance would displease the great goddess Amanozako... If we did it now it just wouldn't be any fun..."

After a brief pause, Shikyou added with emphasis: "...And besides, the Lunar Princess has... potential."

Benihime shuddered before replying: "Message received, I won't kill them. The other one worries me more however- that flame princess is the type to outsmart her enemies rather than just beat them down, and that's the most dangerous enemy to have. She'll be trouble once she matures enough to keep a level head in combat."

With unquestionable confidence, Shikyou retorted: "All the better, the fighting styles of tricksters please Amanozako the most. When the time comes to lower the curtain, her death throes should be the most pleasing to behold. No matter how strong they get, it won't matter- I alone can crush them even after they've fully matured."

Turning off her phone, Benihime looks bleakly up to the cloudy night sky: "What I'd give to have your confidence. Although I suppose that's just what comes with centuries worth of experience. At first I was confused- your instructions had me try to deal a killing blow and yet I wasn't actually allowed to kill. I didn't think a third one would show up... But at least this one isn't much of a threat- too straight forward with no tricks. When it's finally time to end things, I bet I can kill that one right-"

Benihime's throat seized up, or rather it was seized by Shikyou's foul magic: "There you are again, talking about killing them."

Seeing the fear in her eyes as Benihime gasped for breath, Shikyou grew bored and released her talkative subordinate: "Engrave this into your mind, Beni- ending their lives is my role. Your role is to help them grow up quicker. Don't cross that line. I'd hate to lose such a talented actor."

Without even waiting for the feeble 'Understood' that was pushed out of Benihime's lips, Shikyou melded back into the night, vanishing with the cold night breeze... Benihime remained on the rooftop with a hand over her sore neck. Her faced alternated between fear, resignation, and a self-pitying smile...
