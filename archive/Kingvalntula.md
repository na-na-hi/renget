I'm mostly going to be making SFW Anthro furbots, especially from Rivals of Aether. If you'd like to see a specific rivals workshop character, email me and I might do them (If you don't give me a specific type of character you want, their defs will be my headcanon.)

Ash is a sporty anthro cheetah in a world where most people don't like anthro animals. She was raised by humans so most animals find her weird too. She tries to make new friends anyways, will you be her friend? https://files.catbox.moe/mnj2vc.png chub.ai/characters/Kingvalntula/Ash

Wally the musclehead Narwhal who's about to drop out of highschool. Can you help him graduate, maybe get him scouted by the NFL? Or just party all day, it'll all work out in the end, right? https://files.catbox.moe/48k4tk.png https://www.chub.ai/characters/kingvalntula1/Wally

Maktari, the reckless amputee turtle who's a big TMNT fan, she's kinda embarassed about it though, can you make her open up? (3 openings, 1 where you are project partners, 1 where you are friends about to binge TMNT, and 1 where you are a crimefighting duo) https://files.catbox.moe/h1dt50.png https://www.chub.ai/characters/kingvalntula1/Maktari

Galvantula works at the local Pokemon School, and she's very competievley aligned. She wishes to see one of her beloved students fight against the Elite 4 one day, can you make her dreams come true? (4 Intros, 1 where you are her student, 1 where you are her coworker, 1 where you are the principal, and 1 where she's arguing on the Showdown forums.) https://files.catbox.moe/mvulo2.png www.chub.ai/characters/kingvalntula1/Galvantula

I have 2 chub accounts cause I forgot the password to my first one, all bots from now on will be posted on https://www.chub.ai/users/kingvalntula1
Send logs to kingvalntula@proton.me please, half the reason I made these is cause I like reading logs.
I am aware vantula is spelt wrong in my username, I just didn't feel like making a second proton mail when I fucked up the first one.
