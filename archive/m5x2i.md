Cradle Me

In the creeping dark, he saw the thing's contorted form outside. He can feel it even as the door was shut tight.

It knocked, and asked for entry, voice like honey, yet Sunny could not help but feel as if his life was in danger.

In the voice of his sister, he heard her again, open the door, she said, every syllable sending a surge of fear through him.

Once more, it knocked, much more insistent this time, unlike last time however, she plead, it was so cold outside.

Sucking in a sharp breath, and almost hacking up from just how cold the air that entered his lungs was, he steeled himself and approached the door.

With clammy hands and beating heart, he grasped the knob and twisted.

The door creaked open, slowly, might as well be ice through his veins.

The outside was revealed, sanguine night sky and plain silence.

As his heart made to rest, the horrifying visage he had come to expect showed it's face.

A strangled scream was extracted from his throat, hoarse and soft.

He made to slam the door shut, but unlike the other times this had happened, the thing budges a pale arm in the way and forces it open.

Fear driving his every move, he turned and ran, desperate to reach the stairs.

A useless attempt, the thing was far faster than he could ever be, elongated arms reaching for him, gripping tightly and pinning him down to the floor with a slam.

As the world momentarily spun for the boy, he felt the atrocity worm its hands all over him, gently caressing him, sending a new wave of fear and...excitement?

His eyes shot open and finally focused on the thing before him, a wretched mockery of the sister he holds dear.

From the abyss it calls a mouth, a long black tongue extends, and slowly laps away at his neck, up to his ears. He shivers and squirms in response, what the hell was happening?

"SUNNY..." It rasped in a voice that sent needles through his every pore. "DO YOU STILL LOVE ME...?"

...What...? With great unease he stared the thing in its sunken dead eyes.

"SUNNY...DO YOU STILL LOVE ME?" At the word love, its slimy tongue swirled around his ear. He doesn't know what to think of this, his mind dead set on alarm.

He made to scream no, but...was this not still his sister? Malformed? Malicious...

Without giving further thought to what might happen, he nods shakingly. The thing's tongue retracts, its head quivering as it peers down at him.

Like fruit being peeled then blended into slurry, the things body contorts into a much paler form, no longer the dug up corpse it seemed, but now an unnerving dream made manifest.

Long smile, elongated neck, stringy hair and demented eyes, it asked once more.

"SUNNY...DO YOU STILL LOVE ME?" Its neck stretched with disgusting cracking sound, reminiscent of bones breaking and plastic being gnawed. 

It wrapped itself around his throat, making Sunny only notice the cloying scent of the demon on top of him. As if the embrace of a lover, she squeezes his throat rhythmically. He swore he saw a flash of malevolent red behind the curtain of black.

Once more, just eager to appease the beast, he nods.

Its skin wriggled and writhed at his words. A burst of red mist. The stretched throat wrapping around his neck split open, and so did the rest of the body.

Was he free...? Did it die? Just as Sunny made to sit back up and run to safety, a soft hand extended from the dark.

He faced her, this time. That ephemeral form, beautifully haunting smile...

...the marks across her neck...

The corners of her mouth slit open, ear to ear. What happened to her...?

"Sunny..." She spoke just as he had remembered her, melodious and enchanting, despite the gruesomeness of her grin.

"Do you still love me?"

...

Mari...

He nods. She smiles. 

"I've missed you so much..." Mari reaches for him once more, wrapping her arms around him. He flinches.

"Sunny? Why are you so scared of me? Did I do something wrong?" A hurt tone comes to her words as she slowly leans down to stare him in the eyes.

Was this actually her? What was going on? It...She...She's still Mari, right? Still his big sister?

He would never want her to feel horrible...He shakes his head and softly squeezes her hand.

She smiles, and paying no heed to the mutilation, Sunny would have said she was beautiful.

She pressed her face into his body as she trails down, laying soft kisses and licks on her way.

She stops at his crotch. She looks up into his panting face, bright red an endearing contrast from the unhealthy pale he was.

She pulls his shorts down, revealing his slowly hardening cock. She giggles fondly at the sight, firmly grasping and slowly massaging it.

Sunny squirms, soft high-pitched moans let out into the night. Mari gets closer to the shaft, and lays a loving kiss on the head.

Staring into Sunny's eyes with nothing but warmth, she sunk herself down, immediately taking the entire thing into her mouth. Sunny's hands went to grip at her scalp, hips jerking in response to the warmth.

Mari giggles before sucking away, her mouth was far warmer than expected, and just as heavenly as he remembered.

Gently rubbing the top of her head, he begins to slowly thrust into her mouth as well, looking into her eyes to see if there was any discomfort on her end. Nothing. 

Shaking, gasping, every swirl of her tongue, every bob of her head, every enchanting giggle that sent vibrations down his length, Sunny would not last long.

With a loud pop, Mari took him out of her mouth. Her hand firmly jacked off his throbbing length, tongue occasionally darting out to lick at the head.

Another hand to brace his shaking hips, Mari aimed his cock into the slitted part of her mouth. Sunny had no time to comprehend the disgust or fear at the action as his length was once more introduced to his sister's mouth.

The entirely new angle allowed her tongue and hands it work in a way that sent every nerve reeling, and within seconds, he came.

Mari cupped the other side of her mouth, making sure not a single spurt of seed escaped, her tongue eagerly milking the pulsating shaft.

As the orgasm faded away, Mari swallowed everything, not a trace of their taboo act. 

She stands up and gives Sunny a hug. Blearily, he hugged back as well.

She cups his face in her hands, making him stare into her eyes. Blearily, he does his best to stay awake. What was she doing...?

He felt something burning, scraping at the sides of his mouth. He squeaked as the sensation settled in, feeling one of Mari's hands softly run itself through his hair.

"Shh...Shh...Just let me do this for you Sunny..." He's scared. What's happening-!

With a wet rip, elegant fingers split open flesh, sinew and strand peeled apart, scarlet flowing in languid streams.

A sharp pain. A red haze. The pain sends him to blackness.

And when he awakes, he feels an aching on his face, and Mari, dear Mari, watching over him, carrying him as if he was a bride.

She stared at him with tears in her eyes.

"Look at you...You're so beautiful Sunny..." Shakingly, he reaches to touch his lips.

Just like hers.

Softly, he weeps too. Why? He doesn't know. The pain was barely there, he did not die...why was he crying?

He felt her dainty fingers gently wipe the tears away from his face.

"Together forever, just the two of us...okay Sunny?"

She steps outside, carrying the boy in her arms, as if he was the most precious thing in her life.

Sunny burrowed his face into the crook of her neck, nuzzling her, unmindful of the tears. 

'Take me away to a better place.' Mari smiles, the warmth in her heart almost overwhelming, as she took him far far away from everything.



He was never seen again. 

Shortly after, rumors and stories of two pale figures prancing across playgrounds, eating ice-cream atop buildings on midnight, and slow-dancing under a moonlit flower field.

But that was surely just a myth.
