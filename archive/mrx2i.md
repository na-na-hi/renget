To be 17 again. Ch. 4.

Your alarm went off, its awful tone marking the beginning of the day. Stretching your arm out you shut it off, wanting a few more minutes to snooze. A certain scent lingered in your nose, reawakening some recent memories, the sheets, the pillows and your body were all reeking of it. 

You searched the bed with your arms, looking for someone else, but only found emptiness. A sense of shock brought you to your senses, and you saw yourself naked in your bed, sleeping with your back turned to the wall. Still filled with confusion you searched your room for something, it was the same as it ever was, with your get-up shoes thrown in the floor, one of them on its side, you noticed, your hoodie barely hanging by your chair, your desk the mess of papers it always was, the only difference being your boxers thrown onto the floor alongside your pants and your shirt. No signs of Mio. Was it all just a dream?  

A strange sound caught your attention, coming from the kitchen, a sizzle coming from a frying pan. You got up and headed for the door, before remembering you were butt naked except for your socks. As you gathered your clothes, the sizzle of the pan ceased and made way for a faint sound of water heating up, bubbling.

You took a deep breath and exited your room, and there she was. 

Mio was cooking breakfast, her expression was full of energy.

“There you are, sleepyhead!” She joked.

In your makeshift table were two plates facing each other, both with two fried eggs, sunny side up, a piece of bread for each. Some cheese had been laid on top of a plate, butter too, with the necessary cutlery. Mio finished brewing some coffee and turned to you.

“How do you like your coffee?” She asked as you gathered yourself, still rubbing your eyes awake.

“Huh, black.”

“Got it! I take mine with some sugar, I like it that way.”

Mio placed two cups on the table and began serving the coffee.

“Took me some time to find your dishes, although everything is so close to each other.” She spoke. “Also, you need to check your fridge! Instant lunches, energy drinks, no greens. You’re worse than a mangaka!” She giggled to herself.

Still you couldn’t believe your eyes, Mio’s hair was messy and unbrushed, but it gave her a strangely hypnotizing look, homely and casual. If only you could wake up every day to the same landscape, you thought. She sat at the table, and you joined her. You blew on the coffee and took a quick, small sip, then dunked your bread onto the egg yolks, and ate it. Then, with a fork, you smeared some of it on the egg whites and took a bite. Incredibly tasty, not a single spot was flavorless.

“What did you put in it?” You asked Mio, who had been staring at you with a huge smile on her face.

“Salt.” She replied.

Both of you ate your breakfast, after that Mio grabbed a broom and began doing some cleaning. You tried to stop her in embarrassment, but she wouldn’t say no. 

“You should be worried about getting to work, Anon, you’re gonna be late.” 

You checked the time. 8:14.

In a hurry you went to take a shower to wash off the sweat. You headed to your room covering yourself with a towel. Mio saw you and whistled as you passed, your only response being your red face and a flattered expression.

“Hey there hotstuff~” She teased you as you entered your room.

After you got dressed in your office clothes, Mio was still cleaning, closing a garbage bag and slowly getting up. She felt your stare over her shoulder and gave you a soft smile.

Mio had to leave as well. 

“I’m gonna get to the office.” You said. “Want to come to the station?”

“Sure, but hold on. You can’t go like that.”

“Like what?” 

Mio took off your tie in the blink of an eye and just as quickly made the same elegant knot she did last time. 

“T-Thanks, Mio.”

“Don’t mention it.”

Seeing her this happy and carefree made you realize something, Mio had to go back home and face her husband. A sharp worry pierced your heart, and Mio caught up on it pretty quickly.

“Something bothering you, Anon?” She asked you.

“What are you gonna tell, you know…”

A sudden sadness brushed over Mio’s face without altering her cheerful smile, but in her eyes, you could see she had been rummaging the idea aswell.
 
“I’ll figure something out, Anon. Don’t worry about me.”

“Mio…” 

Mio stared blanky at your chest, and then rested her head on it. Your arms came around her body to comfort her, running your fingers through her hair and caressing her.

“If anything happens.” You told her. “Just know I’ll be here for you.”

Mio’s heart began beating faster. How good it felt for her to hear such words and to be able to trust them.

~*~

Once Mio was back at her husband’s home, she took a long, relaxing shower and began cleaning around to clean her mind.

“Let’s see.” She told herself. “I could say that I was working late, but I know he would’ve seen me in bed. How plausible is it to say I got home late and left super early? Maybe I should say I was celebrating a coworker thingy…”

Mio did her bed as she kept brainstorming a narrative to tell her husband, who wasn’t an idiotic man. She needed something that was solid and veritable. Once she finished doing her room, she moved over to the kitchen. Time had gone by so fast she didn’t notice the clock reaching 6:32

“Anon must be going home by now…” She though as she peeled some potatoes. A sudden realization slammed her back to reality as she realized her husband was about to be home any second too.

And sure enough, she heard his car pull over in the driveway, her heart began speeding up and she took deep breaths to calm down.

She heard his footsteps on the stairs, the keys at the lock, and felt the wind enter the house as he opened the door.

Trying to seem as casual as possible, she greeted him from the kitchen and he headed over to peek.

“How was work, honey?” Mio asked him as she brought the peeled potatoes over to the sink to rinse them.

Her husband sat in the kitchen and Mio began losing her composure.

“It was fine.” He said with a sneaky tone. His wife didn't call him sweet names anymore.

Mio kept silent.

“Say, Ookami.” Mio knew she was in trouble. Her husband only ever called her by her first name when he was about to give her an earful.

“At what time did you come home yesterday?” He asked.

“Hmm, let me think…” Said Mio, trying to find a way out of this conversation. “It was past 12, I think.”

“And why was that?” 

“One of my coworkers got pregnant, so we went out to celebrate.”

“You drank with a pregnant woman?”

“I said nothing about alcohol. We went to eat ramen, it was her choice. Sorry if I made you worry.”

“I see.” Her husband took a more assertive posture. “But, I didn’t see you when I woke up.” 

Mio was cutting up carrots and accidentally cut her finger when she heard those words. As she saw a string of blood run down her finger, she almost panicked thinking of what to say. Everything was hanging from one thread, and as she rinsed off the blood, she bet everything on one thing. 

“Didn’t I tell you a few days ago?” She blundered.

“Huh?” Said her husband.

“We have some new talents coming in, the company ended the selection process and now some of the older ones are teaching our kouhai all they must know.” Mio kept cutting up carrots. “We show up extra early to prepare some stuff for them, we give them dance lessons, singing lessons, stress management techniques and so on.”

Her husband was trying to read his wife’s corporal language, but he couldn’t spot anything that told on her. Mio was focusing as hard as she could on the veggies, taking deep, quiet breaths.

“I was given a particular talent, too.” Mio kept going. “I taught her a bunch of stuff yesterday.” She said, as she reminiscenced her night with you. “She really seemed to enjoy it, I hope she keeps up her hard work.”

Her husband looked puzzled, he didn’t remember Mio saying anything about teaching newer girls how things worked, given he didn’t really pay attention to most of the stuff his wife said. Trying to find a moment during their daily life in which Mio said anything of the sort, his memory came up short.

“Well.” He said as he got up. “Good luck I guess.”
 
And so he went for a beer from the fridge and sat before the TV once more.

Mio sighed in relief inside. Her plan worked, and even if he had his suspicions, he knew nothing, not only of her affair, but of her in general.

~*~

A few days went by, and you only saw Mio during your time in the office. You went out to eat again, the same chef welcoming you, silently mocking your embarrassed face. Mio and you chatted about your life and work alongside a nice bowl of ramen, and as you two left, you two made out under the streetlights. 

After your last encounter, both of you knew her husband would be extra vigilant, so you settled with having a bit of fun with her after work, not willing to risk her safety over your lust. You did the same for over a week, you were doing fine for the most part, but Mio was growing impatient. 

Tonight, it was like any other night. The light from the streetlights, the starts, and the shine of Mio’s eyes being your only company.

“Ah, Anon, are you coming in tomorrow?”

“Yeah.”

“Can you get here a bit earlier?”

“Sure.” You said, without asking why. “How earlier are we talking?” 

“Around… uh… well, not a “bit” earlier, but maybe… 30 minutes?”

“Eh… sure.”

“Hehe, thanks.” Mio gave you a peck on your cheek.

You walked her to the station and set your alarm one our earlier. 

In the end, you woke up by yourself, feeling fully energized.

~*~

You waited outside of the building, still closed. It was 8:23. Soon after a man came and unlocked the doors. Mio showed up not much after. A few staff members were coming in too.

“Ah, you’re Anon, right?” Asked a girl with a purple attire.

“Uh, yeah. That’s me.”

“Early to rise?” 

“Yup.”

“Good to see!” She said as she entered the building. 

Mio greeted you with her eyes, but without saying a word in front of the others, telling you to follow her with her hand. Soon enough you found yourselves in the fourth floor, where security and human resources were. 

“What did you have for breakfast, Anon?” Mio asked.

“Toast.”

“Just that?”

“I put some butter on it, too.”

“Well, at least you’re eating something I guess, don’t make me have to cook breakfast for you too!”

You giggled at her remark, but also asked yourself what kind of wonders Mio could make.

“So, uh, why did you ask me to come this early?”

Mio’s expression shifted quickly, her cheeks reddening.

“I’ve got an idea, Anon.” She gave you a lecherous stare. “This early in the morning, the only people here are A chan, the entrance guard and a few engineers.” Slowly you began understanding what she was getting at. 

“This place is a real ghost town in the morning...” Said Mio as she grabbed onto your arm and led you towards the toilets.

~*~

Sitting on the toilet, Mio undid your belt and in a hurry pulled down your pants and your underwear, you were sweating bullets, thinking anyone could come in any minute, this didn’t stop you from getting hard at the touch of Mio’s gentle hands.

“M-Mio, there must be another way.”

“I’m sorry Anon…” She said as she covered her left eye with your penis, looking at you with puppy eyes. “I just can’t hold back anymore, I haven’t felt like this in ages.” But the situation was starting to down on her too, this was Anon’ second time, and here he was, inside an office toilet. She felt terrible with herself, since you were obviously uncomfortable. 

Mio seemed to reconsider her plan for a bit, looking down at your shoes. If they walk out now, no one will notice and no one gets in trouble.

“B-But you’re right, this is a bit too extreme.” She said, about to put your member back in your pants, as she felt you caressing her head from above.

She looked up to you and saw a nervous smile, accompanied by fidgety eyes.

“J-Just this once, okay? We’ll figure out something for next time.”

Feeling revigorated, Mio smiled back at you.

And so, she began servicing you.

Mio gave you short kisses on your tip, making you twitch in anticipation, she knew what she was doing and she loved teasing you, rubbing your erect penis against her cheek and slapping it a few times. As much as she wanted to keep playing with you for a while, she knew time was short, so she took you in her mouth in one go. 

“*Ah-ahhh, mmm*.” You clenched your teeth to shut any noise coming from your mouth as your hand pet Mio’s head. Mio looked up at your face of ecstasy and wanted to see more. Closing her eyes and breathing in, she pushed you all the way into her throat. You opened your eyes in shock, the texture of her throat was silky, delicious to the touch, you were losing control of your breath and your hand was twitching on top of her head, losing yourself in pleasure.

Mio gagged and she slowly brought herself back, regaining her breath as she saw you losing your mind.

“Maybe that’s a bit too much for him right now.” She thought to herself,  giggling a bit. She ran her tongue across your shaft until she reached your balls, gently sucking on your scrotum before she gently brushed your left testicle up and down with her tongue and running circles around it, your penis covering her face, yet giving you the same lecherous stare she gave you the first time she milked you with her mouth. Finished with your balls, Mio licked you across your dick once more, stopping at your tip to give it a peck before running circles around your head with her tongue. All you could do was clench your teeth and caress her head, Mio bobbed her head up and down, using her tongue plentifully. An idea crossed your head, and you took Mio’s fluffy ears into your hands gently, then began rubbing them.

“Hmm! Ahh!” Mio stopped suddenly and looked up at you. She looked confused but not displeased, and without sparing a second she began blowing you once more, more intensely than before, quickly moving back and forth as you touched her ears more.

Mio fell to her knees and your penis slipped out of her mouth, as she regained her breath, she tilted her head a bit back and opened wide, sticking her tongue out to you.

“Ahhh~!” She said with her lustful eyes. Mio took your wrists into her hand and placed both of your hands behind her head. You seemed unsure as to what to do next, but Mio gave you a nod, and you didn’t want to disappoint her.

Taking Mio’s head into your hand gently, you began slowly thrusting, Mio was rubbing her tongue back and forth as your dick entered her mouth. Her hands grabbed your buttocks and pushed them forward following your rhythm that was beginning to slowly increase.

“Mio…Mio… I’m close to…”

Mio’s eyes opened ever so slightly, pleading you to release your seed in her mouth, her hands running up your lower back and her nails digging onto it just how you liked it. 

Her expressions, Mio’s skillful mouth mixed with the sensations that ran across your body and also the adrenaline, the risk of getting caught brought you to your limit soon enough and you shot a spurt of cum inside Mio’s mouth, then another one, then another, smaller one finally ending with a single drop that leaked from your hole.

Mio opened her mouth wide to show you her tongue full of cum, two of your pubic hairs were stuck to her cheek, she closed her mouth and in one swift motion, swallowed everything you gave her, opening up once more to show you her clean tongue. Mio took brushed your hair away and saw the little drop of cum dangling from your tip. She licked it clean and gave your penis a kiss, before giving you a happy smile. You were still regaining your breath as Mio got up-

“Shh~” She said.

You were reminded of were you two were, so you both shut up, trying to hear someone else. The coast was clear. Mio opened the stall and left in a hurry to the ladies’ toilet, going to clean her face.

You exited the stall and soon after someone else entered the bathroom, one of your coworkers.

“Hey, how are ya?” 

Still trying to control your breath, you looked at him and washed you face.

“I’m doing fine, what about you?” You said.

“Doing fine too.”

He looked at you for a second and noticed the sweat.

“My God, did you run a marathon to the office or something?”

“Eh? Ah, no, no. I just uh, I don’t know.” 

“Do you have a fever Anon? Your face is all red.”

“Don’t think so. I’m feeling fine, maybe my pressure went up.”

“Huh, take care of that, could be serious since you’re so young.“

“I will, don’t worry.” 

He gave you a pat on the back and left. Looking at yourself in the mirror, you never felt so good in your entire life.

Soon after everyone else came to the office, and after having a coffee, you went by your work day.

~*~

The day went by in the blink of an eye. Soon enough the clock sent you home and you met with Mio at your usual spot.

You two walked in silence for a bit, before Mio broke the ice.

“So, did you like it Anon?”

Your smile told on you. 

“Yeah. But holy, you’re insane Mio.”

“I got some ideas from… somewhere, that’s all.”

You both laughed and kept walking to the station. But something came back to you suddenly.

You pat Mio’s head gently, and slowly reached for her ears. She stopped you almost immediately.

“P-Please do not do that, not here.” She asked you, completely red faced.

“Okay, I’m sorry.”

~*~

Mio’s head was clouded by some nasty thoughts, but she wasn’t as bothered by them as before. Instead she tried to search for ways to approach them and solve whatever was bothering her.

While submerged in a hot bath, she tried to organize her thoughts. 

She hated how secretive she had to be about her encounters with Anon, after the event in the bathroom she realized how dangerous this situation was, for how long could she keep up the lie to her husband? For how much longer would she and Anon be unable to share a proper bed as lovers? Mio blew bubbles in the bathwater, knowing she’d need some guidance.

~*~

“So, what’s the matter?” Said Korone as she took a drag from her cigarette, putting it behind her the next second. “Sorry, I forgot you’re bothered by the smoke.”

“It’s okay.” Said Mio, waving the smoke away. “I just need some advice about… marriage stuff, you were married, right Koro-san?”

“Twice.” She replied, putting up two fingers.

“So, what happened?”

Korone took another drag from her cigarette with a thoughtful look.

“Well, in what sense do you mean “What happened”?” She asked Mio. “I got divorced once, as for my second husband, we just parted ways, and now well, I have my things with Okayu and so.”

“Was it hard to, you know, come through with the divorce and all of those decisions?”

“Well… “ Korone flicked her cig and took her time to answer. You see, I got married because my parents told me to, but me and the guy, we didn’t share anything, in fact he hated that I played too many games. After a few years I just said, “To hell with it.” And brought up the divorce. He refused at first, but after a while he gave up and signed the papers. As for my second husband well, I really liked him at some point and I hurried him to marry me, thinking I just had to, you know? But, over time the same thing that happened with my first repeated itself, but I wasn’t mad at him or anything, it was just my mistake. So, after the spark died out, I told him I was gonna leave, he didn’t object to it, and yadda yadda. Now as far as I know, he has a new partner, and I have mine, but technically, were still married.” She finished her cigarette and put it out before throwing the butt into the garbage.

Mio was still analyzing what Korone said. Korone realized Mio was confused, so she summarized her monologue for her.

“Okay, so, listen. I know you’re unhappy with your husband, and if Anon makes you feel-“

“H-How did you know I was talking about Anon?!”

Korone laughed at her. “Oh, I’m sure you look at him with those dreamy eyes only because he’s your manager, alright.” Mio became red faced. 

“Don’t worry, I’m not telling anyone.” She assured her. “Anyways, as I was saying, if Anon makes you feel in a few months what your husband couldn’t in years, it’s obvious where your heart stands, and as for your husband, don’t worry. It’s just a piece of paper that holds you two together, but you can leave him if you want. You don’t need a ring to love someone either, and you should get to know Anon personally first.”

Mio seemed conflicted about Korone’s honesty, but she knew in the end she was right. She'd take her ideas somewhere else where she could think about them thoroughly.

“Thanks, Koro-san.” 

“Don’t mention it.”

~*~

“Come on Anon, why don’t you come with me?~”

“For the last time, stop this right this instant.”

Matsuri was pulling on your shirt trying to get you to follow her, but you stood firmly.

“Come on Anon~, I just want to show you something. Or are you scared, Anon?” 

“Matsuri, please. I’m losing my patience.” 

“And what does that mean? Hehe~”

You looked to the side trying to shrug her off, but the girl had a firm grip on you, suddenly, your blood ran cold as you saw Mio coming back from her break, as soon as she saw you two, she came right towards you.

You were scared that Mio was going to get the wrong idea, Matsuri didn’t see her until she was right next to you two.

“Matsuri, what do you think you’re doing?”

“I’m just trying to get Anon to-“

“Talents and managers aren’t supposed to get this chummy and you know it.” Said Mio in a strange, angry tone you never heard from her before, talking over Matsuri and giving her a death glare.

“Y-Yeah, you know that.” You said.

“B-But Anon’s suppose-“

“Matsuri.” Said Mio in a firm tone. “If someone sees you and gets the wrong idea Anon’s gonna be in trouble and it will be your fault. Let him do his job as he musts.”

Matsuri, once so cheerful and carefree seemed like a cowering puppy, hiding its tail between its legs. Getting scolded by her coworker suddenly shut her usual energy.

“I-I’m sorry.” She said as she finally let go.

“Great, so, we have dance practice together later, yes?”

“Yeah, I think, anyways I have something to do, see ya.”

Matsuri hurried out of sight and a wave of relief washed over you. Mio in turn, turned to you.

“Are you okay?”

“I am now.”

Mio seemed relieved. You quickly looked around to see if someone was watching and after confirming the coast was clear, you gave Mio a quick kiss on the lips and waved her goodbye as you walked off.

Mio looked at you as you disappeared behind a wall. She bit her lower lip and felt her heart skip a beat.
