Good for everything not **too** extreme, like killing, ~~wholesome~~ gruesome torturing, raping, etc. It'll still work with everything, give it a swipe. The high entropic nature will bring unexpected shit all the time; it'll also trip the filter easier, though personally I prefer it this way (keeps the RP dynamic). It'll adhere to the character sheet above all, breaking formatting only when pushed too hard towards the filter; it'll prefer to trip the filter instead of breaking formatting, though breaking can still happen. Because it's canonical, your RP experience will depend HIGHLY on the character, this JB won't save the RP from a shitty character, and it won't colorize it with detailed descriptions unless specified by the character sheet. I don't recommend tinkering with it. It's VERY sensitive and will break down. If you want another version, say with 10/10 freedom, just keep fucking with me on aicg and I'll eventually release it.
