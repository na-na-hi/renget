# Makoto's Super Special Sugar Selection 

"... Hmmm... I'm hungry."
*"So?"*
"Who'dja think will lend me cash for a snack without asking for it back? Let's see..."

***
>Mari Aozaki
"Um... Well, she's everyone's senpai, I suppose... Tries to be reliable, keeps everyone in touch, runs the club and all that... I don't think there's anyone that outright dislikes her with how hard she tries. Didn't even know that cursed ones *could* associate this way until she dragged me into the club room, one day..." He scratches at the side of his face, smirking a little at the memory. "But, uhh, if you ask me..." 

"She's naive." 

Makoto shrugs, helplessly. "If ya think about it... Most cursed ones are worthless. Monsters, totally and completely, whose blood you wash your hands with. And the club can't last forever... I dunno if she's had to confront that yet, being so busy playing organizer and protector. But when that shoe drops, it'll be ugly."

He yawns. "Just hope I won't wind up in the blast zone... Especially cuz no matter how hot she is, she's got those flat-broke vibes. Don't infect me with your poverty aura, lady... She might be willing to lend me snack money, despite the scary face, but I dunno if she's *able* to..."

Yuki pokes a finger through Makoto's cheek, laughing raucously. *"Lo~ser! Talk about a beta mentality, muderboy. Whatever happened to the little hellion you used to be?"*

"Mhh... I wonder."

**SUGAR RATING:** C+ "Tall woman erotic... Aah, but if she's still doing this, her wallet probably only has 2 silver coins, some lint, and a fly in it. Boo..."
***
>Eiyu Isamu

"*Hot guy detected! Always go muscular, ALWAYS! Hot over cute aaaaany day of the week, cute boys will ruin your* ***life!***"

"Really...? I'll note that down... So normie guys are your type. For me, I dunno if I could ever be in a serious relationship with someone who doesn't know about all of this stuff, it just sounds like courting doom... Ah, but exploiting someone for their cash under the pretense of a relationship is totally fine, actually. Even better, since most cursed ones are poor as balls - like Mr. Normie here..."

*"Hey, he's solidly middle class! It's YOUR standards for wealth that are all out of whack!"*

Makoto rolls his eyes. "Be that as it may... Yu-chan might be normal, but he's hardly clueless. Any Hunter with two eyes could look at 'em and see that he's got a demon of his own clawing at his soul; whether he's noticed is another kettle of sulfur entirely. Hope he wises up before anyone gets hurt, but maybe he's happier in the dark... Sometimes he drops by the club, he might be friends with one of the Hunters I think...? Hard to gauge this one... I don't wanna risk getting shoved into a locker for asking for cash..."

**SUGAR RATING:** C-. "Normie...? I don't wanna do sports. Nghghh..." 
***
>Emilia Shadowsong

"Mhm. Schoolgirl, meet schoolboy. Bet I could shoujo the shit out of her... But am I in the mood for white bread...? She's kinda basic... About as normie as normie gets while being in this business. Maybe that's a good thing for her, but does it make her a viable sugar mommy...? Dunno. Questions, questions... Though I can't tell if this is more of a philosophical or practical issue, cuz ultimately she won't let me get close if she doesn't even like me in the first place, and, uhhh..."

*"Go on. I'm sure this'll be riveting."*

He grins, a little sheepishly. "Well, I get the feeling Emi-chan isn't the biggest member of the Makoto fanclub. Her loss... Or, uhm, gain...? Eh. I guess that name of hers is a little exotic, especially the surname, but maybe she's a hafu and foreign people are just called like that... Don't wanna get called culturally insensitive, I'm on thin enough ice at school as-is... Maybe I'll just avoid her for a while, let her feelings towards me cool off a li'l..."
 
*"Don't... Don't make me think about a whole fanclub for you. Nasty... Tch, now you've even got ME talking like you!"*

**SUGAR RATING:** C. "I don't think her allowance is gonna cover rent."
***
>Ikari Michita
"... Loud..."

A full minute passes in agonizing silence. 

"Um... Were you expecting more, Ki-chan...? You're not usually this quiet..."

*"Nah. I'm just amazed it only took you this long before giving up, usually you'd at least make it 5 or 6 people in before letting this train of thought derail entirely."*

"Ah. Well, I mean... There isn't a lot to say about Michi-chan that hasn't been said already... Or screamed, or spat at a wall, or... Well, you know. He's a pretty aggro dude... It's kinda amazing he hasn't been banned from school at least, that's something, right...? But if I asked 'em for cash, he'd probably break my leg and then break my eardrums by screaming at me nonstop... Talk about a nightmare scenario, I dunno if..." *Yaaaaawn...* "I've ever... Nnh, want a nap... Ever seen someone so controlled by their sin befo.... Re."

*"... You know what? Not even worth it."*

**SUGAR RATING:** F- "I'm kinda attached to my... Well, everything that's attached to me..."
***
>Naoki Arai

"... Cute..."

*"WHAT?!"* Yuki does a double take. If she could drink water, she'd be spitting it out right now.

Blink-blink. "Huh? Did I stutter...? You got ectoplasm in your ears, Ki-chan? He's cute. Too bad about everything else... But I guess there's a little bit of gap moe in taming the shrew, or whatever... Don't think it's for me though, that's putting a lot of work in. I guess Ru-chan would have fun molding him, at least... It's not like anyone can accept Nao-chan as he is, all bluster and puffed up. Not even himself, I think, which is the main problem..."

*"Almost a cogent point, for once. I'm* ***almost*** *impressed!"*

"Every time I try to talk to him, though, he just gets up and leaves while muttering something about traps... I don't really get it, I always thought I was more of an up-in-your-face fighter, a real slobberknocker, a bare-knuckle brawl enthusiast... Heh. Either way, I guess trying to get money outta him would end up in a similar way..."

**SUGAR RATING:** C. "Aw man, it's like looking into a mirror... You're too handsome, it would never work... Plus you'd probably start screaming about how you're straight. I wanna keep my eardrums cozy..."
***
>Akari Ichioka

"... Heh. This one's funny. I dunno if Sunshine really gets what's going on... But they say ignorance is bliss, or whatever, so I don't worry about her too hard. From what I've heard a couple demon hunters use her cafe as a meetup spot, but it's pretty far from my house so I never wind up going... Plus, I just know Ru-chan would try to get me in uniform, but like I always say, you die if you work..."

*"What a bimbo! Cute, but she can't hold a normal conversation outside of her oh-so-special interests, and talk about tacky. Girl, this isn't Shinjuku."*

"She'd make a pretty good sugar mommy, but we don't really know each other well enough for me to broach the subject... Plus, what if Sunshine really is a vampire...? Spooky. I didn't think they were real, but I didn't think a lotta things were real just a couple years ago, so I'm keeping an open mind... Too scary to ask for money out of the blue..."

*"More like you're too lazy to actually investigate."*

**SUGAR RATING:** A-. "Mhm. Noisy. Rich. Smile and nod, nap on the bloodstains. A cafe is fine too."
***
>Amano Lemon

"Ummm... Lemon's pretty cool, I think... I'm a big fan of his stuff. Finding out about new snack spots is actually way more fun than going to them, you get to daydream about how good everything tastes instead of being disappointed by the ugly reality... So his videos are really cool for that kind of thing. Personality-wise, he used to come to school, but stopped before I could really get a good read on him..."

*"Really? He didn't seem like the type to be fighting his own personal crusade or anything like that..."*

A shrug. "I don't usually assume when it comes to stuff like this... Maybe he's got some other stuff going on. From the vids he's been putting out, he's definitely poor, but I dunno *how* bad things really are if the guy's still cranking at the content mill... Respect the grind, at least, but there's no way he's pulling anything more than passion-project numbers..."

**SUGAR RATING:** F. "I like your channel... Sometimes I'll fall asleep to your videos... A-ah, not that they're boring. Shame about the analytics, though..."
***
>Hifumi Ishiku

"Great chest. I used to use her streams to lull me to sleep all the time, but they've been less comfy lately... The vibe's all off. I get the feeling most of her viewers aren't tuning in just for the calming atmosphere... Shame. I mean, I followed in the first place cuz of the cleavage too, but that's not why I *stayed*... Guess the public can be cruel like that."

*"How come YOU'RE not streaming? It's basically free money."*

He rubs at an eye.

"... don't wanna go buy yoga pants, mostly. Hope she gets outta this slump, it'd suuuuck if I had to go find some ASMR streamer to get my cozy bedtime content routine back up to snuff... Can't tell if it's the audience drama or something in her real life that's spoiling stuff. I usually don't pry into personal details like that, I'm suuuuper considerate you know... She should probably be getting advice from me, now that I think about it... Even if I'm super jelly about the NEET stuff she has going on. Quid-pro-quo, maybe..."

**SUGAR RATING:** C- "I bet she could probably squeeze me somewhere into her NEET budget with some penny pinching... Wouldn't mind if she squeezed me against her too."
***
>Hinako Shimeki

"I haven't really heard a lot about her... Most of the cursed ones I meet are from napping in the clubroom after school, so the ones like her usually elude me..." Makoto stretches his neck for a half second... Before giving up, allowing it to loll back down to a neutral position. His half-lidded eyes remain thoughtfully cast upwards throughout the whole process. 

"But what I've heard isn't very good. Rumors about her turning people into dolls, bossing everyone around, getting all touchy... Umm, I started out with the worst rumor, but still, they all make her sound kinda annoying... Maybe Mari-senpai just likes to play with fire..."

*"Like you're one to talk. Weren't you scheming up ways to meet cute with her the other day?"*

"... Ehe. Yeah. But that's different... I heard doll-girl is loaaaded, those BJDs don't come cheap... I don't think she'd be the *worst* option for a piggybank, even if she's liable to try something weird..."

*"How are you even alive?"*

**SUGAR RATING:** A+ "Huh...? Another woman? Do you think I get out that much? You're too rich to cheat on. Yeah, yeah... You can manhandle me I guess, just don't touch the back, I lay on that..."
***
>Yoru Heinard

"I usually prefer cute to sexy, but somehow, we ended up as friends...? Or, uhm, it more feels like *I* ended up as *her* friend, instead of any other arrangement... Ru-chan's pushy like that. Plus, from how she keeps talking, she wants to push me to do even more stuff, haaaaagh... I don't wanna go *that* far, don't try and make me into something scandalous, please... I've still got my pride as a man at the end of the day..."

*"Seriously?"*

"Yup. Super seriously. Anyways, Ru-chan's okay, I guess. I like her. But she can bring up a lot of bad memories, and she seems like she teeters on the borderline sometimes... Mmh. Hope I don't hafta kill her for doing something awful."

*"She's gonna get bored and finally make a proper schoolgirl out of you one of these days, gyahahaha! Hopefully you end up with a nice rack, so I can feel at home when I finally take over your feeble mind!"*

**SUGAR RATING:** ??? "I get the feeling that going down this path might be... Dangerous. Very very dangerous. I'll just not think about it..."
***
>Sezāru Ishiku

"Uhmmm, he's... One of the club members who's around my age. But we never really talk... I can sense the aura of a fellow deviant emanating from him, however. A scintillating opportunity, but who knows if we're truly compatible... Only the passing of the moon may illuminate such silver truths."

*"NOW is when you choose to slip into dork-speak???"*

"You wouldn't get it. Uhhh, what else do I know... His sister's pretty hot. He's always handing out snacks and stuff for free to the club members. Used to give me a bunch too, but for some reason he slowed down with the supply after we got to know each other slightly better... Wonder why. I get the feeling he's mostly on the up-and-up, but who knows, maybe one day I'll be given an opened bottle of cola and wake up on a fishing boat..."

*"Would serve you right!"*

"I guess he wouldn't be awful to ask for something to eat, but all the snacks he carries are suuuuuper sugar-dense, and I'm kinda in the mood for something salty..."

**SUGAR RATING:** D. "Kinda girl-crazy... I dunno how long I could keep up the feminine facade, maybe I'll just cut my losses before they hatch... Or however it goes..."
***
>Kazuki Asahara

"What are the odds? We don't get just one, but TWO demon-cursed preachers... That's gotta be a sign or something. The end times are a-comin'... Just hope they don't get here before I can secure the bag for a few years... I'm not super religious, and I get the feeling he reaaaaally likes to keep his congregation under his thumb... Or that's what Yoji says. Hopefully he's not doing anything fucked-up with his eye, otherwise I'll hafta go outta my way to find out what's up... Ughhhhh..."

*"Interested in reliving the old days a little, psycho?"*

"Well... Not really... Maybe I just leave the investigating to the other club members, if I remember to pass along the concerns to them... On the other hand, how many of them have had to kill a fellow cursed one before...? Being judge, jury and executioner like that doesn't seem like most of their styles... Hrm. Kinda... Have to think a little more about this..."

**SUGAR RATING:** D- "The collection plate's a-janglin', but the churchbells are even louder. I gotta rack up all the goodboy points I can get after the whole demon thing..."
***
>Amane Shiozaki

"For such an introvert, she's kind of a networker... Everyone knows Ama-chama, I think. Or at least they should. Sometimes I'll nap in her library if mom or my cousin's home... It's kinda chilly in there, but the second floor is usually quiet enough that I can catch some Z's regardless. I heard she'll do basically aaaanything for a book if it's rare enough..."

"*Hey. Brain out of the gutter, perv."*

"Huh...? I didn't even say anything. Talk about projecting..."

"*You little-!"*

Yuki rains blows down on Makoto's prone form, her balled fists passing right through his amused expression. 

"The big thing with Ama-chama is just to go with the flow... She's got her rules, so if you stick to 'em you'll be okay... Don't tell her I said this, but maybe she should get out more. She'll get insecure if you say stuff like that out loud, I'm guessing the books are just as much a distraction as a hobby... Anyways, I thought about asking for a room in her Library permanently, but she'd probably ask for a bunch of stuff in return, so I can't leech yet... Gotta find a better moment..."

**SUGAR RATING:** B+ "Comfy... I wanna sleep in a pile of books... And living in a library means you don't have to pay rent. Ah, wait, but I probably have to eat...? Aah, I'd figure it out..."
***
>Komaru Nishitani

"People always tell me to stay away from her, but never really elaborate on whyyyy... The allure of the unknown is almost too much to bear... But I'll probably live. It's probably pretty mundane, as far as dirty little secrets go... Something like her family being in organized crime or whatever. Bo~ring, but hey, money is money and I heard they're loaded. Not that you could tell from how she dresses herself... C'mon, you can show off a *little,* I won't tattle..."

*"I don't think she wants to take fashion advice from YOU. Personally, I think it's nice to see at least one of women here has a sense of refinement!"*

Makoto snickers. "Ya think...? She's easy to talk to, I s'ppose, but there's more to personality than ease I think... There's no accounting for taste, I guess... And speaking of taste, I heard that Maru's run in a more exotic direction. Just rumors, though, so getting confirmation would be a massive pain... Kinda rude, too... But she's serene enough that maybe she'd just let it all slide off her back. I've seen her take on a Night Creeper before, she's got other ways of venting that frustration..."

**SUGAR RATING:** B. "Awooga. Look at that bank balance... But you wouldn't fluff my pillow, would you...? And stab wounds are kind hard to sleep on... Hum, decisions, decisions..."
***
>Yoji Ryoshi

"Umm... He's kind of a big pain in the ass. Why do I gotta exercise when I'm not even fat...? Makes no sense... Otherwise, I dunno why he keeps pestering me to come to his chapel. They don't even let you drink the holy water... I don't wanna ask him for anything in the first place, he'll probably use it as an excuse to give me a sermon."

"But, otherwise... I think he's kinda full of surprises for someone so weak." Makoto yawns. "Most people can't see Yuki... And even if I tell 'em about her, they usually don't believe me... But one day outta the blue, he asked me how come there's a line coming off my heart that wraps around me and ends a few feet in mid-air. Talk about a jumpscare..."

*"Eh? Wait, you have a line connected to me? Huh? Huh?! What color was it? What color was it, you violent little bastard...!?"*

"Heh... You can't just pry into a maiden's secret like that..."

**SUGAR RATING:** F- "Ugh... No thanks... Vows of poverty, and I can't even put a ring on it... wait, are you even a real priest...?"
***
>Mithran Kuro

"She's kinda hard to pin down... Kuro-chan's all over the place. Angry one moment, sleepy the next, it doesn't seem like she's interested in being easy to understand by others... All I really know is that she loves her reenactment stuff. I guess she really wants to be a hero...? Not that the title of hero is anything but soaked in blood. I bet she's got some killer abs under that armor..."

*"One of these days you're going to need to be taught a real lesson about respecting women, you freak."*

"What she doesn't know won't hurt her. Aaaanyways, if I called her up for some cash, she'd probably give it via a clenched fist to the face... She likes to help out, but I get the feeling it's not for small stuff. Haaaaaagh, Pride girls can be such a pain sometimes..."

**SUGAR RATING:** C- "You're kind of a meathead... I could probably take the house in the divorce, but then you'd prolly pulp my face. Man... Larp stuff isn't cheap..."
***
>Harhui Oohara

"Harupyon's real fun to tease. Cute. But she's a sore loser, so you gotta know when to not go too far, otherwise she'll get all weird and pretend not to sulk... We're kinda like best acquaintances, with how well I can read her. She's a genki gal through and through. Fun and funny to be around, would probably lend me cash but also deeefinitely ask for it back... Autistic too, to boot. Or at least I think so... But she wears it pretty well. Just like how well she wears that spandex suit... How come so many of the girls get these cool costumes...?"

*"It's called a THEME, lazyboy. Something you're too hopeless to stick to - even your Demon Eyes are completely incoherent together!"*

*Bleh.* Childishly, his tongue is stuck out at Yuki. "Says the one making 'em even more inconsistent... Anyways, I guess Harupyon's on the lonely side. Maybe I'll ask her to go to a space museum sometime. Easy to see the only child syndrome in her eyes whenever she's being ignored... If I haaaaad to guess, she's probably in need of a reality check. You could drown her in friends and it wouldn't change anything about her core..."

*"That's rich coming from you, Mr. Rotten-Hearted."*

**SUGAR RATING:** B- "Pretty good, but... You'd probably forget to feed me because of some special inclining of venus or whatever... I don't wanna walk to the fridge... Weh."
***
>Yuki Tanaka

"Hey, Ki-chan... D'ya know where the first Demon Lord kept his demon armies?"

*"Huh? Where's this coming from? And how the hell would* ***I*** *know that?!"*

"... *Snrk...* Up his demon sleevies..."

*"Oh, for-- why the hell did I have to get stuck in YOUR head?"*

"Aw, come on...! It's funny...! And relevant... Sometimes, it feels like you 'n me are some of the few cursed ones whose arms *haven't* been taken over by their demons... We got that self-control on lock, right? But it looks like your namemate here doesn't... Sucks for him, but I guess it's nice to be strong. Kind of a double-edged sword..."

*"Never use the word namemate again."*

"Either way, I dunno what kind of stuff he has going on outside of the whole 'raging combat monster' thing... Boy needs more hobbies than burying his nose in books and fobbing off the running club... Probably just from a normal middle-class home."

**SUGAR RATING:** C. "Look, I'm not saying he *couldn't* be a sugar daddy, I'm just concerned about long-term profitability..."
***
>Ashton Ramsey

"Hoo boy. Talk about a catch... And I'm not talking about on the field, heh. I'm so funny. His Japanese isn't super great, but I can look past a lot when he's just a year away from being a bigshot sports star... Do you have any idea how much money they make in America? Cuh-rayyyyzy numbers, more than he could ever spend in a single lifetime... I bet a whole bunch of people are gonna be hangers-on, he could probably tolerate just one more..."

*"Hard to believe this is what the Blue Oni of Nerue Middle School has been reduced to."*

"Pshhh. You're gonna make me blush, bringing up lame old nicknames like that... Besides, I think I caught Ash-kun looking at my legs once, so he owes me at least a LITTLE money as compensation. It's only fair... Pretty crazy that they even have demons overseas. Maybe if I still had some fire left, I'd be all up in arms about solving what's become a global problem, buuut... That sounds like someone else's job."

*"You're an example to us all."*

"Anyways... He'd pro~lly give up the dough with a li'l flirting, but... Uhhh... I dunno where he actually hangs out when he's not on the field, so I don't wanna go find him..."

**SUGAR RATING:** A+. "I'd almost feel bad about how easy it'd be to wrap him around my finger... Almost."
***
>Aki Hitoyoshi

"I dunno about this one. He's my wuvvly-luvvly li'l kouhai, but there's something off about this guy... Call it instinct or whatever, but my hackles get all up whenever I look at 'em. Maybe I just don't like strong guys..."

*"Maybe you're jealous! He's WAY cuter than you could ever be, pervert."*

Snort. "Maybe... Either way, outside of the weird stuff, he can be kinda funny sometimes. He'll say stuff like fam or kino... I don't think anyone else has noticed though, heh. Silly li'l otaku, not that he's hiding *that* part from how much manga he consumes... Sometimes literally. It's not really that funny whenever you see him fight, though. Guy just throws himself at the enemy like there's no tomorrow... Then again, maybe he knows something I don't and there isn't. Wonder what's really going on up there..."

**SUGAR RATING:** C. "Those card packs are kinda expensive, but I just can't shake that feeling about him... Ughhhh..."
***
>Jace Abraxon

"Um... So, d'ya have any strong opinions about card games, Ki-chan...?"

*"You can just admit that you don't know anything about this dude, dumbass."*

Makoto's face scrunches up like he had to eat a lemon. "Ehhghhhhh... But that's kinda like admitting defeat... I'm already this far in, giving up *now* would be a total anticlimax...! He, uhm, talks to the air a lot. Not that that's super unusual with this lot... This guy's always picking a fight I guess, constantly trying to prove himself... Kinda subby behavior if you ask me, he reeks of wanting someone to challenge him back and put 'em in his place... Couldn't be me, I'm too unambitious to ever be about that kinda life. Maybe I could hook em up with someone like Kuro-chan...? Eh."

*"Alright, this time your brain actually IS in the gutter!"*

"Well, no matter how he really feels, he sure thinks of himself as a big, strong hero... I could probably use that against 'em, but is it reaaaaally worth it...?"

**SUGAR RATING:** B+ "Wowww... Doesn't Solomon have some big famous mythological vault, or something...? You think he'll let you in if you finish your quest? By the way, I never noticed, but your cards are suuuuper strong..."

Hey, congrats, you made it to the end! ∠( 'ω')／Have some fun miscellaneous Makoto facts that I couldn't fit in anywhere else:
- Makoto is 5'4.
- He got held back a grade! Something about 'flagrant disrespect for the dress code,' never bothered listening through the whole lecture.
- His ideal type is an extremely cute but princely rich girl (or oujo) who will pamper him night and day and sweep him off his feet.
- Makoto lives alone with his mom, who's always working, but sometimes his older cousin comes over to drink with her and lament how shit the rest of their family is (Makoto included).
- He knows where everyone sleeps.
