Makoto's Super Special Sugar Selection 

"... Hmmm... I'm hungry."
*"So?"*
"Who'dja think will lend me cash for a snack without asking for it back? Let's see..."

>Mari Aozaki
"Um... Well, she's everyone's senpai, I suppose... Tries to be reliable, keeps everyone in touch, runs the club and all that... I don't think there's anyone that outright dislikes her with how hard she tries. Didn't even know that cursed ones *could* associate this way until she dragged me into the club room, one day..." He scratches at the side of his face, smirking a little at the memory. "But, uhh, if you ask me..." 

"She's naive." 

Makoto shrugs, helplessly. "If ya think about it... Most cursed ones are worthless. Monsters, totally and completely, whose blood you wash your hands with. And the club can't last forever... I dunno if she's had to confront that yet, being so busy playing organizer or protector. But when that shoe drops, it'll be ugly."

He yawns.

"Just hope I won't wind up in the blast zone... Especially cuz no matter how hot she is, she's got those flat-broke vibes. Don't infect me with your poverty aura, lady... She might be willing to lend me snack money, despite the scary face, but I dunno if she's *able* to..."

Yuki pokes a finger through Makoto's cheek, laughing raucously. *"Lo~ser! Talk about a beta mentality, muderboy. Whatever happened to the little hellion you used to be?"*

"Mhh... I wonder."

SUGAR RATING: C+ "Tall woman erotic... Aah, but if she's still doing this, her wallet probably only has 2 silver coins, some lint, and a fly in it. Boo..."

>Akari Ichioka

"... Heh. This one's funny. I dunno if Sunshine really gets what's going on... But they say ignorance is bliss, or whatever, so I don't worry about her too hard. From what I've heard a couple demon hunters use her cafe as a meetup spot, but it's pretty far from my house so I never wind up going... Plus, I just know Ru-chan would try to get me in uniform, but like I always say, you die if you work..."

*"What a bimbo! Cute, but she can't hold a normal conversation outside of her oh-so-special interests, and talk about tacky. Girl, this isn't Shinjuku."*

"She'd make a pretty good sugar mommy, but we don't really know each other well enough for me to broach the subject... Plus, what if she really is a vampire...? I didn't think they were real, but I didn't think a lotta things were real just a couple years ago, so I'm keeping an open mind... Too scary to ask for money out of the blue..."

*"More like you're too lazy to actually investigate."*

SUGAR RATING: A-. "Mhm. Noisy. Rich. Smile and nod, nap on the bloodstains. A cafe is fine too."

>Hinako Shimeki

"I haven't really heard a lot about her... Most of the cursed ones I meet are from napping in the clubroom after school, so the ones like her usually elude me..." Makoto stretches his neck for a half second... Before giving up, allowing it to loll back down to a neutral position. His half-lidded eyes remain thoughtfully cast upwards throughout the whole process. 

"But what I've heard isn't very good. Rumors about her turning people into dolls, bossing everyone around, getting all touchy... Umm, I started out with the worst rumor, but still, they all make her sound kinda annoying... Maybe Mari-senpai just likes to play with fire..."

*"Like you're one to talk. Weren't you scheming up ways to meet cute with her the other day?"*

"... Ehe. Yeah. But that's different... I heard doll-girl is loaaaded, those BJDs don't come cheap... I don't think she'd be the *worst* option for a piggybank, even if she's liable to try something weird..."

*"How are you even alive?"*

SUGAR RATING: A+ "Huh...? Another woman? Do you think I get out that much? You're too rich to cheat on. Yeah, yeah... You can manhandle me I guess, just don't touch the back, I lay on that..."

***

>Yoru Heinard

"I usually prefer cute to sexy, but somehow, we ended up as friends...? Or, uhm, it more feels like *I* ended up as *her* friend, instead of any other arrangement... Ru-chan's pushy like that. Plus, from how she keeps talking, she wants me to push me to do even more stuff, haaaaagh... I don't wanna go *that* far, don't try and make me into someone scandalous, please... I've still got my pride as a man at the end of the day..."

*"Seriously?"*

"Yup. Super seriously... Anyways, Ru-chan's okay, I guess. I like her. But she can bring up a lot of bad memories, and she seems like she teeters on the borderline sometimes... Mmh. Hope I don't hafta kill her for doing something awful."

*"She's gonna get bored and finally make a proper schoolgirl out of you one of these days, gyahahaha! Hopefully you end up with a nice rack, so I can feel at home when I finally take over your feeble mind!"*

SUGAR RATING: ??? "I get the feeling that going down this path might be... Dangerous. Very very dangerous. I'll just not think about it..."

***

>Amane Shiozaki

"For such an introvert, she's kind of a networker... Everyone knows Ama-chama, I think. Or at least they should. Sometimes I'll nap in her library if mom or my cousin's home... It's kinda chilly in there, but the second floor is usually quiet enough that I can catch some Z's regardless. I heard she'll do basically aaaanything for a book if it's rare enough..."

"*Hey. Brain out of the gutter, perv."*

"Huh...? I didn't even say anything. Talk about projecting..."

"*You little-!"*

Yuki rains blows down on Makoto's prone form, her balled fists passing right through his amused expression. 

"The big thing with Ama-chama is just to go with the flow... She's got her rules, so if you stick to 'em you'll be okay... Don't tell her I said this, but maybe she should get out more. Anyways, I thought about asking for a room in her Library permanently, but she'd probably ask for a bunch of stuff in return, so I can't leech yet... Gotta find a better moment..."

SUGAR RATING: B+ "Comfy... I wanna sleep in a pile of books... And living in a library means you don't have to pay rent. Ah, wait, but I probably have to eat...? Aah, I'd figure it out..."

***

>Yoji Ryoshi

"Umm... He's kind of a big pain in the ass. Why do I gotta exercise when I'm not even fat...? Makes no sense... Otherwise, I dunno why he keeps pestering me to come to his chapel. They don't even let you drink the holy water... I don't wanna ask him for anything in the first place, he'll probably use it as an excuse to give me a sermon."

"But, otherwise... I think he's kinda full of surprises for someone so weak." Makoto yawns. "Most people can't see Yuki... And even if I tell 'em about her, they usually don't believe me... But one day outta the blue, he asked me how come there's a line coming off me that wraps around me and ends a few feet in mid-air. Talk about a jumpscare..."

*"Eh? Wait, you have a line connected to me? Huh? Huh?! What color was it? What color was it, you violent little bastard...!?"*

"Heh... You can't just pry into a maiden's secret like that..."

SUGAR RATING: F- "Ugh... No thanks... Vows of poverty, and I can't even put a ring on it... wait, are you even a real priest...?"

***

>Mithran Kuro

"She's kinda hard to pin down... Kuro-chan's all over the place. Angry one moment, sleepy the next, it doesn't seem like she's interested in being easy to understand by others... All I really know is that she loves her reenactment stuff. I guess she really wants to be a hero...? Not that the title of hero is anything but soaked in blood. I bet she's got some killer abs under that armor..."

*"One of these days you're going to need to be taught a real lesson about respecting women, you freak."*

"What she doesn't know won't hurt her. Aaaanyways, if I called her up for some cash, she'd probably give it via a clenched fist to the face... She likes to help out, but I get the feeling it's not for small stuff. Haaaaaagh, Pride girls can be such a pain sometimes..."

SUGAR RATING: C- "You're kind of a meathead... I could probably take the house in the divorce, but then you'd prolly pulp my face. Man... Larp stuff isn't cheap..."

***

>Aki Hitoyoshi

"I dunno about this one. He's my wuvvly-luvvly li'l kouhai, but there's something off about this guy... Call it instinct or whatever, but my hackles get all up whenever I look at 'em. Maybe I just don't like strong guys..."

*"Maybe you're jealous! He's WAY cuter than you could ever be, pervert."*

"Maybe... Either way, outside of the weird stuff, he can be kinda funny sometimes. He'll say stuff like fam or kino... I don't think anyone else has noticed though, heh. Silly li'l otaku, not that he's hiding *that* part from how much manga he consumes... Sometimes literally. It's not really that funny whenever you see him fight, though. Guy just throws himself at the enemy like there's no tomorrow... Then again, maybe he knows something I don't and there isn't."

SUGAR RATING: C. "Those card packs are kinda expensive, but I just can't shake that feeling about him... Ughhhh..."

>Harhui Oohara

"Harupyon's real fun to tease. Cute. But she's a sore loser, so you gotta know when to not go too far, otherwise she'll get all weird and pretend not to sulk... We're kinda like best acquaintances, with how well I can read her. She's a genki gal through and through. Fun and funny to be around, would probably lend me cash but also deeefinitely ask for it back... Autistic too, to boot. Or at least I think so... But she wears it pretty well. Just like how well she wears that spandex suit... How come so many of the girls get these cool costumes...?"

*"It's called a THEME, lazyboy. Something you're too hopeless to stick to - even your Demon Eyes are completely incoherent together!"*

"Says the one making 'em even more inconsistent... Anyways, I guess Harupyon's on the lonely side. Maybe I'll ask her to go to a space museum sometime. Easy to see the only child syndrome in her eyes whenever she's being ignored... If I haaaaad to guess, she's probably in need of a reality check. You could drown her in friends and it wouldn't change anything about her core..."

*"That's rich coming from you, Mr. Rotten-Hearted."*

SUGAR RATING: B- "Pretty good, but... You'd probably forget to feed me because of some special inclining of venus or whatever... I don't wanna walk to the fridge... Weh."

***

>Sezāru Ishiku

"Uhmmm, he's... One of the club members who's around my age. But we never really talk... I can sense the aura of a fellow deviant emanating from him, however. A scintillating opportunity, but who knows if we're truly compatible... Only the passing of the moon may illuminate such silver truths."

*"NOW is when you choose to slip into dork-speak???"*

"You wouldn't get it. Uhhh, what else do I know... His sister's pretty hot. He's always handing out snacks and stuff for free to the club members. Used to give me a bunch too, but for some reason he slowed down with the supply after we got to know each other slightly better... Wonder why. I get the feeling he's mostly on the up-and-up, but who knows, maybe one day I'll be given an opened bottle of cola and wake up on a fishing boat..."

*"Would serve you right!"*

"I guess he wouldn't be awful to ask for something to eat, but all the snacks he carries are suuuuuper sugar-dense, and I'm kinda in the mood for something salty..."

SUGAR RATING: D. "Kinda girl-crazy... I dunno how long I could keep up the feminine facade, maybe I'll just cut my losses before they hatch... Or however it goes..."

***

>Hifumi Ishiku

"Great chest. I used to use her streams to lull me to sleep all the time, but they've been less comfy lately... The vibe's all off. I get the feeling most of her viewers aren't tuning in just for the calming atmosphere... 

SUGAR RATING: C- "I bet she could probably squeeze me somewhere into her NEET budget with some penny pinching... Wouldn't mind if she squeezed me against her too."

***

>Eiyu Isamu

"*Hot guy detected! Always go muscular, ALWAYS! Hot over cute aaaaany day of the week, cute boys will ruin your* ***life!***"

SUGAR RATING: C-. "Normie...? I don't wanna do sports. Nghghh..." 
***
>Jace Abraxon

SUGAR RATING: B+ "Wowww... And you can get into the whoooole vault, right...? Not half the vault, or a quarter, but allo-soloman...? Just curious, haha. By the way, I didn't notice but you're suuuuuch a cool hero... Can you resolve my naptime quest?"
***
>Naoki Arai

SUGAR RATING: C. "Aw man, it's like looking into a mirror... You're too handsome, it would never work... Plus you'd probably start screaming about how traps are gay. I wanna keep my eardrums cozy..."
***
>Amano Lemon
"Ummm... Lemon's pretty cool, I think... 

***
SUGAR RATING: F. "I like your channel... Sometimes I'll fall asleep to your videos... A-ah, not that they're boring. Shame about the analytics, though..."
***
>Komaru Nishitani

SUGAR RATING: B+ "Awooga. Look at that bank balance... But you wouldn't fluff my pillow, would you...? And stab wounds are kind hard to sleep on... Hum, decisions, decisions..."
***
>Yuki Tanaka

SUGAR RATING: C. 
***
>Ashton Ramsey

"Hoo boy. Talk about a catch... And I'm not talking about on the field, heh. I'm so funny. His Japanese isn't super great, but I can look past a lot 

SUGAR RATING: S. "I'd almost feel bad about how easy it'd be to wrap him around my finger... Almost..."

>Kazuki Asahara

SUGAR RATING: B-.

>Emilia Shadowsong

"Mhm. Schoolgirl, meet schoolboy. I bet I could shoujo the shit out of her..." 
SUGAR RATING: C.

>Aino Sasaki
"... who?"
SUGAR RATING: Secret SSR++ tier. What's she gonna do if Makoto takes her wallet, cry loudly? Get real.

>LUCIFER VLADIMIR TEPES DEATHUS DRAKUL DARKNESS
"... who?"
SUGAR RATING: ???

"Mmh... All this thinking's made me tired, maybe I'll just go take a nap instead..."
