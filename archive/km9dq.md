>Still in America with my boyfriend
>For the first time in my life, I feel like I'm somewhere I truly belong
>But there's a problem
>Will my friends and family be okay with me moving here permanently?
>They know how much my boyfriend and I love each other
>And how well he treats me
>And how happy he makes me
>And how much I've enjoyed my stay in America
>And how hard it was for me to get along in Japan
>I call my parents to talk to them about the prospect of doing so
>I'm afraid they won't approve of the idea
>To my surprise, they're not against it
>They're a bit saddened and worried, by their own admission, but they think it would probably be good for me
>They know my boyfriend is a good man who cares deeply for me
>So if I really want this, they're willing to let me give it a shot
>Just want me to stay in contact with them through calls, emails and visits
>And for me to introduce them to any grandkids I might give them
>They say my friends will probably accept my decision too
>I thank them for understanding and we hang up
>So overwhelmed with emotions I start crying
>I hear footsteps running to my room
>My boyfriend bursts in and asks me if something's wrong
>Kami, what did I do to deserve such a kind and caring boyfriend?
>I smile through my tears and tell him what happened
>He sits down next to me and wraps me in a hug
>Starts stroking my hair
>After all this time, he can still make me weak in the knees
>"Your parents really care about you."
>"I know. I'm so glad we can be together here with their blessing."
>'And maybe someday, they'll be your in-laws', I think to myself.
