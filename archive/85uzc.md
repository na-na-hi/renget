#FOBS B

===========================================================================
#####->MISC. STUFF<-
###### X-Ray Vision:
in the Lakeside Woods, at the pit which leads to the Minotaur boss fight, jump over it and climb
over the cliff to find the x-ray panel. At your base, you can enter the treehouse to find the
panel hanging from the wall. Pressing UP in front of it toggles the x-ray cut-in for certain
scenes.

###### Kamaitachi (Second Animation):
can only be found on the B-Side and is unavailable to the A-Side.
Her panel is hidden at the Lakeside Woods, in the room with the two giant trees with teleporters
inside of them. Use the double jump to climb up between them and find the panel at the top of the
room.

###### Mouse Girl (Second Animation):
can only be found on the B-Side and is unavailable to the A-Side.
In the Abandoned Estate, have sex with a Blob in a cat automaton on the pink platform to the right
to deactivate the barrier. The Mouse Girl Panel is at the end of the corridor.

===========================================================================
#####->Lakeside Woods<-

###### Tanuki Girl:
simply defeat her in her boss fight.
Second Animation: find her home first by going from the shortcut next to her boss fight to the
rightmost end of the room and take the teleporter. Then use the double jump to get over the left
cliff and take that teleporter. Ejaculate onto her, and wait for her to spread her legs. After
having sex with her, you'll automatically end up in a remote room with her panel.

###### Dragon Queen/Tiamat (needs Wild Slash and Shout):
cannot be captured.
Her boss fight is surprisingly challenging. Approach her, but jump away before getting too close
to bait her tail swipe, then attack her with the Wild Slash. When she starts drooling, switch to
Shout and use it to neutralize the hearts before they hit you. Also use Double Jump to get past
her when you're cornered. Eventually, she will walk away. At this point, you can visit her in her
house and do her as much as you want.

###### Minotaur Girl:
simply defeat and collect her.

###### Lovebird:
in the room with the entrance to the Volcano, a group of three of these will assault you from the
canopy. Watch for falling leaves to predict where they'll descend, and attack each three times.
Afterwards, go to the right, past the entrance to the Volcano, and use the double jump at the
arrow indicator to enter the upper canopy. A lovebird will sit there, sleeping and open to capture.

===========================================================================
#####->The Volcano<-

###### Cockatrice (needs Kitsune):
attack her and dodge her petrifying gaze with a Kitsune transformation. Eventually, she will
charge up a barrage of petrifying gazes. Transform into a rock at the last moment to evade the
attack (after exactly ten ticks), and the Cockatrice will be so exhausted, you can simply take her
with you.

###### Steam Golem (needs Masturbation Skill):
you can hit her or run into her to make her mad. While she's literally steaming from the ears,
ejaculate onto her to clog her up to capture her.

###### Cat Sage/Enit:
cannot be captured.
Defeat her in her boss fight and then return to the house you passed on the way. The Cat Sage will
wait for you there. Walk to the panel and press UP to switch between her blowjob and sex animation.

###### Centipede Girl (needs Masturbation Skill):
either hit her with the Kobold Hammer, or ejaculate onto and then attack her. She will retreat,
and when poking her head out, quickly ejaculate onto her, and she can be picked up.

###### Salamander:
at the Save Point deep into the Volcano, jump off the ledge to the right to enter Salamander's
lair. Defeat her in the ensuing battle, and she's yours.

###### Flame Demon:
touch the purple wisp and you'll get caught in her trap. She will quiz you on monster girls you
encountered, and how many of them. The answers are 1 Cockatrice, 3 Lovebirds, 3 Apples, 3 Flame
Demons (notice the two wisps above and below her), 4 Steam Golems, 7 Centipedes, and 1 Salamander.
Get it wrong 3 times, and it's game over. Persevere, and she will surrender to you.

###### Bicorn (needs Masturbation Skill):
when encountering her past the Flame Demon, masturbate in front of her to get her in the mood, then you
can bang and subsequently collect her.

===========================================================================
#####->Abandoned Estate<-

###### Hypnotic Demon (needs Slime Wall):
jump over her heart projectiles and hit her, until she starts sweating. Now, use a Slime Wall on
her heart projectile to turn the tables on her and add her to your collection.

###### Shapeshifter (needs Masturbation Skill):
in her room, ejaculate onto the only figure that isn't greyed out. She will absorb your semen and
turn into a female version of the MC, offering to be captured. Approach her and press down, then
quickly get away from her before she can overwhelm you. After a few seconds, she will assume her
original form and start attacking. Deal enough damage, and she will give up for real.
Second Animation: in the Centipede Nest of the Volcano, head to the shaft with the moving block.
Jump over it and quickly run left to reach the door behind it. The panel is hidden in the next
room.

###### Ghoul Girl:
after having activated the switch in the Shapeshifter's Room, jump into the pit again. Down there,
head right and turn on the power. All the Ghoul Girls hiding in the darkness are now blinded by
the light and can be picked up with no resistance.

###### Librarian Ghost (needs Masturbation Skill):
after having turned on the power switch, head for the door between the old bookshelves. Attack her
so she loses her clothes. Then, masturbate close to her, and quickly jump over the onahole she
flings at you. After ejaculating onto her, she will give up.

###### Blob (needs Masturbation Skill):
ejaculate onto one of the blobs crawling on the ground, then follow it as it rushes to one of the
cat automata. Have sex with it, and after the deed, claim your prize.

###### Devourer (needs Kobold Hammer):
beyond the Blob Room, you will be met by a door maze. In each instance, head through the door with
read candles, and memorize the order in which you went through the doors. After going through each
door once, you'll end up in a big room with four stakes and a door to the right. Use the Kobold
Hammer to drive the stakes in the same order in which you went through the doors. bottom-right,
top-left, top-right, bottom-left. If done correctly, a second door will appear. Go through it, and
you'll find the Devourer ready for capture on a platform.
