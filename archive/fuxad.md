\>Be Anon
\>You decide to hit up some dating site called Hugs 4 Bugs
\>All kinds of fellows join this site though
\>Anyway, you're searching for a preferably male non-human lover because why not.
\>Thot, thot, thot, hot dude that shares none of your interests, human, human...
\>All of a sudden you see a somewhat familiar face, a blue, white, and black sea sluggy looking face.
\>He kinda reminds you of an old college roommate who you were good pals with, but after you both graduated you kinda went your separate ways, but there's no way it's him. You check his bio...
\>"Call me Ishmael."
\>What a coincidence, it is him! You scroll down his bio more.
\>"Occupation: Chef at the Pequod"
\>Huh, so he did make a job as a chef.
\>Y'see, he was originally gonna be a fisherman who worked on his dad's boat and live off his business and eventually take over when his dad can't fish anymore, but something bad happened that completely turned him away from that job. He didn't like to talk about it though.
\>Now that you think about it he was pretty worried about his dad his first year into college... He was a nervous wreck for a while. 
\>Anyway, you're glad he's got a nice job.
\>Suddenly, you notice something... interesting.
\>"Preferred partner: Male"
\>Huh.
\>It's worth a shot, you both knew eachother and you share similar interests so it oughta work.
\>You try not to sound creepy and you simply type "Hey"
\>After a while, you get a message back.
\>"Anon? Like, roommate Anon?"
\>"Yep"
\>"Dude I haven't seen you in years!"
\>And just like that you two converse, talking about what you've been up to the past few years, completely forgetting you're on a dating site.
\>After a nice conversation about stuff you wait for the right time to ask Ishmael about, y'know, dating.
\>As you finish typing what you're gonna say he beats you to the punch and says,
\>"Do you maybe want to visit? I'm pretty sure I don't live far."
\>"Yeah, when can I come?"
\>"Will tomorrow work?"
\>"Yeah"
\>He tells you where he lives. You're quite surprised to realize he only lives an hour away.
\>On your side, you're happy to be meeting up with your old roommate and maybe becoming more than friends.
\>On Ishmael's side, he's fucking ecstatic. You don't realize this, but the big slug kinda has a bit of a crush on you. He's just really happy, y'know?
\>Before you start packing some stuff up, you take a peek as some of his pics.
\>He's buff, really buff. 
\>There's one with him in his chef's attire, some pics of his best recipies, a few casual selfies, ect.
\>Though it's quite obvious when looking at only of his pics, he doesn't seem too keen on showing himself off, there's only like one picture of him shirtless and it's 'cause he's at the beach.
\>You... analyze that one in particular. How can such a soft-lookin' guy be this buff?
\>Anyway, he's a light blue with black spots on his head and black stripes running down his body. There's a couple bluish-white wavy thingies running down his neck to his shoulders
\>He's got a really cute face that doesn't fit his body, and atop it are a couple of blue and black antennae that sorta look like bunny ears. His eyes are a beautiful blue.
\>A similar but less black cluster of tendril thingies above his butt looks sorta like a tail but not really.
\>He's got some nice pecs and a solid pack of abs to boot.
\>Anyway, after gawking at his body for a while you finish packing a few things and you head to bed.
\>After an hour-long drive you arrive at Ishmael's house.
\>It looks kinda like your typical beach house, built up high, aquatic-themed decorations, ect.
\>After a long walk up the stairs, you ring the doorbell and wait. Then it opens.
\>You're greeted with the sight of your old college roommate! Though... He looks a tad tuckered out.
\>"Hey Anon! I didn't expect you to get here so early."
\>He's wearing a tank top and a pair of mesh shorts. The tank top is a little on the loose side and the shorts... they're not on the loose side.
\>By the way, Ishmael is pretty tall, your face is level with his chest.
\>You both shake hands. His hand feels weird, like it's sticky and slimy-feeling but he doesn't seem to leave behind any sticky stuff.
\>You head inside and you both chat a bit.
\>"The reason I asked you to get here a bit late was because my last shift at The Pequod ends around closing time. It was a pretty long shift."
\>He's fanning himself a bit, you're not sure if that's sweat or his weird slug slime.
\>"Picky customers, a buncha people, a hot kitchen... yeah. Um, what kinda drink do you want? I got water, tea, Dr. Pepper, uhh... milk?"
\>You decide to go with water, he tosses you an ice-cold bottle and he grabs one. You sit down on his couch and he just flops down on it with a sigh.
\>"Like, I love working there but, whew! Sometimes it takes a lot out of you, y'know?"
\>By the way, Ishmael is pretty tall, your face is level with his chest.
\>Anyway, you two chat for a good while and catch up, talking like old friends. You both even play some vidya too, for a guy who looks like a total Chad he's a big nerd.
\>All of a sudden, he gets this look on his face, like he's about to say something.
\>Finally, he quietly says,
\>"Say... Y'know how where we talked was on a dating site, right?"
\>Yeah?
\>"And... You checked out some of the info on my profile, right?
\>Yeeeaah?
\>"Aaand you saw my, er, preference, right?"
\>Yeeeeeeaah?
\>"And I saw YOUR preference. You see where I'm going with this?"
\>You sit there with a stupid look on your face until Ishmael says,
\>"I was just thinking... maybe we could go on a date?"
\>Admittedly, you were considering asking that question but you were trying to find the right time to ask it.
\>"I mean, I like you, like I really like you, and I just thought we'd give it a try."
\>You tell you you would love to go on a date with him and that you like him too.
\>He doesn't say anything, but the joyous look on his face says all you need to know.
\>Suddenly, he wraps his arms around you and gives you a big hug! 
\>You absolutely did not expect this.
\>Your face is in contact with his chest, and he doesn't seem to realize that you can't breathe and he's hugging you a little too hard. 
\>Even still, you aren't too bothered by this, he's just really happy.
\>...But you are getting a bit bothered by your growing erection. Your face being in contact with a big, sweaty slug's chest isn't exactly helping your situation.
\>You finally tap out when your bulge rubs on his, and unbeknownst to you, Ishmael noticed the bulge-rubbing and is blushing a bit when you two break the hug. His blush contrasts his coloration and is VERY noticable.
\>"Sooo... uh... yeah."
\>Athough Ishmael's not hugging you as tightly, you're still laying on him, resting your head on his chest. He's... visibly flustered.
\>You ask him where he's planning on taking you, clearly he hasn't thought this far yet.
\>"Uh... I dunno, I'm free all day tomorrow. The Pequod isn't open on Sundays. Er, the original owner was religious and the tradition has always stayed... Anyway, I was kinda thinking the beach, I mean the weather's gonna be great and we could grab a bite to eat later that night."
\>That'll work.
\>"OK, good! You need a tan..."
\>What was that?
\>"Nothing!"
\>You two play vidya for a couple more hours, until you both realize you're getting tired. You say you don't mind sleeping on the couch, until Ishmael pipes up and says,
\>"I dunno, I was thinking maybe we could sleep together? The... The bed's big enough and I just think it would be kinda nice. But I AM a cuddler, so... you decide."
\>You say would love to sleep with him.
\>You get that same, really happy look you got before.
\>"Woah, really?"
\>You nod
\>He leads you to the bedroom, there's indeed enough space for you two. You look around his room for a bit, then your eyes are drawn to the big slug removing his shirt.
\>He puts his hands around the waistband of his pants and gives you a look, like he's wondering if you're OK with him sleeping in his underwear.
\>You give him a thumbs-up.
\>He sheds his pants too. He's wearing a grey pair of boxer briefs that really leave nothing to the imagination, even his balls have a visible outline. Wait is that a wet spot?
\>Anyhoo, you strip down to your undies too and you both hop into bed. Almost immediately Ishmael begins cuddling up with you. He feels oddly soft, especially his pecs. You nuzzle those in particular, eliciting a blush from him.
\>Or is that blush from your bulges rubbing closely together?
\>"G'night, Anon"
\>G'night Ishmael.
\>The next day.
\>You wake up to the sun in your eyes, to find Ishmael's not in bed, and something smells divine.
\>You follow that scent, it leads to the kitchen and what do you find? A big breakfast and Ishmael making some coffee and putting it in a stupid-looking smiling mug.
\>"Oh! Mornin'!"
\>He's wearing a pair of grey and red swimming trunks and a tank top.
\>You ask him what time he got up
\>"About an hour ago, I think. I'm used to getting up really early. Anyway, eat up before it gets cold!"
\>And eat up you did! Bacon, scrambled eggs, pancakes drizzled in syrup. You eat it all!
\>While eating, you get a sudden realization that you forgot to pack swimming trunks and you tell him about that.
\>"No problem, you can wear a pair of mine."
\>He tells you where they are and you set off to grab a pair, tripping on the stairs on the way up.
\>You snoop around and find a simple, blue, floral pair of trunks. That'll work.
\>You also find a... speedo? It's black and has a cutesy-looking skull on the front.
\>...
\>How the fuck does he fit in this thing
\>Anyway, the trunks are a tad big but can be tightened. You also throw on one of his tank tops.
\>In the meantime, Ishmael's getting together beach-related stuff like towels, snacks, an umbrella, chairs, the usual. He carries almost everything on his own without much issue.
\>You both take a quick walk to the beach. He lives surprisingly close to it.
\>You both pick a perfect spot and set everything up, spray sunscreen, shed your tops, ect.
\>"A bit hot out, huh? Didn't really expect that."
\>The weather's not the only thing out here that's hot.
\>He looks at you with a blush before chuckling.
\>"Nice."
\>"So, whaddya say we get going?"
\>You nod and follow him to the ocean. You both proceed to act like absolute dorks.
\>In the span of 30 minutes you two lose a beach ball, impersonate Sinistar whilst chasing seagulls, call waves varying expletives before getting knocked over by them, jumping over waves, nearly running into several people while boogie boarding, ect.
\>After getting a bit tired you both fall back and rest, but not before catching a glimpse of Ishmael's swaying, wet bulge.
\>You both rest and people watch, it's surprisingly fun.
\>Ishmael seems to be getting a lot of looks from the women there. He leans over to whisper to you,
\>"Boy would they sure be disappointed."
\>HAH!
\>Though... you can't blame 'em for looking, you've been catching a few peeks at the outline in his trunks, make more noticeable due to his trunks being wet.
\>For a while, you both fuck around in the water, eat snacks, build a really shitty sandcastle, you stare at his bulge, eat sandwiches he packed for lunch, etc.
\>After a couple more hours you both decide it's about time to pack up, head home, and get showers 'n shit. Again, Ishmael carries pretty much everything.
\>Ishmael insists you shower first, you grab some clothes and head upstairs. You struggle with figuring out the shower, strip down, and wash up at a relatively fast pace.
\>You walk downstairs to see Ishmael playing Darkest Dungeon. You give him the OK that you're done and he goes upstairs and prepares are his shower
\>You look at the screen
\>Apparently he's fighting the Crocodilian.
\>Good fucking luck.
\>Anyway, Ishmael turns on the shower and strips down, his half-erect cock now free from its prison.
\>His dick is big and thick and even when he's erect there's a hood of his foreskin hanging and his balls are big, heavy, and they tend to smell musky. His junk is a notably darker hue of blue compared to the rest of his body.
\>During his shower, his dick slowly rises to full mast.
\>"Fine... You wanna be like that, huh?"
\>You notice the shower's been on for a while, though you simply just dismiss it as Ishmael liking long showers.
\>Eventually the shower turns off, and soon you hear footsteps going down the stairs.
\>Ishmael is only wearing a pair of shorts, he can't stand heat and is hot-natured, it doesn't take much to get him sweating. Though normally he forgoes clothing on the bottom half.
\>"Hey, Anon!"
\>Hey
\>He sits down next to you, you remember how soft and squishy he felt last night, you kinda want to feel that again.
\>You put a hand on his arm and squeeze it. Despite the muscles it feels all squishy. He notices this and blushes
\>"Oh, you surprised? We slugs always feel all squishy no matter how buff we are."
\>You decide to get a little more forward, you lay him down and then you sit on top of him. You start feeling his abs. They're similarly squishy. You give his tummy a poke.
\>"What are you doing? Hey! That tickles!"
\>You slowly move up his body, caressing it in a rather sensual manner. The best way to describe his build is twinkish but also really buff.
\>"...Mmh."
\>Finally, you reach his chest. You start softly feeling his pecs, causing him to huff a bit. Then you start kneading them. You feel a bump on your rump.
\>Ishmael's trying not to say anything, but it's clearly obvious he's VERY flustered. 
\>While you're kneading his pecs, you suddenly realize he might not be comfortable with this. You ask him if he's alright.
\>"Um, I'm arright, don't worry about me!"
\>You give 'em a somewhat-hard squeeze, your fingers sink a bit. You hear a noise come from Ishmael and a wet something rubbing your butt.
\>That squeeze surprised him and sent a wave a pleasure throughout his bod, causing him to spurt a bit of pre.
\>"(If he keeps going on like this, I'm definitely gonna cum... Man, that would be embarrassing... I know he's just curious and all but I really gotta get him to stop.)"
\>Ishmael looks at the clock and notices it's almost time for dinner.
\>"(Oh, that'll work!)"
\>"Er, I noticed it's almost for dinner, mind if I cook it?"
\>Sure
\>You get off of Ishmael, and he quickly goes upstairs, trying to hide his VERY obvious bulge.
\>"Only an idiot would cook shirtless. Safety first!"
\>He runs up and takes a look at just how much pre he's shot. There's definitely a wet spot on his shorts, thankfuly they're black and it isn't visible.
\>His underwear are a different story.There's a large wet spot that's slowly getting a bit bigger.
\>"Yeah, no."
\>He throws his wet underwear in the washer and grabs a new pair. This hasn't quite fixed the bulge situation though.
\>"He'll just have to deal with it..."
\>He runs downstairs and says hey. You're playing TF2 on his computer while you wait. (He said it's fine last night). He's definitely an Engineer main.
\>He throws on an apron and gets cooking. He decides to take your typical ramen noodles and UPGRADE them. It's quick and easy.
\>He adds in veggies, spice, meat, etc. to make some boring but albeit tasty beef-flavored ramen divine.
\>"Food's ready!"
\>You head to the table to see a bowl of noodles waiting for you, alongside it is a pair of chopsticks and a fork.
\>"Eat up! It's ramen noodles, but better!"
\>As you're eating, he explains, in detail, the ingredients he used. You're listening intently.
\>Oh, by the way, it's fucking delicious, you're slurping it up like crazy.
\>"Y'know I would make a joke about the way you're eating those noodles but it would suck."
\>*SNORT*
\>You've already cleaned your bowl. You tell him it tastes amazing.
\>"Heh, thanks. You should see some of the stuff I cook at The Pequod."
\>"So, uh, what are your plans for tomorrow? I do have work tomorrow after all."
\>You tell him you wouldn't mind staying a few days longer. You only live an hour or so apart, it's not like there's any hurry to get home. Also, you genuinely like being with him.
\>"Oh, really? Um, well, what are you gonna do while I'm gone?"
\>Play vidya.
\>"Fair enough."
\>That night, when you and Ishmael are both in bed, you say you want to tell him something.
\>"Hmm?"
\>You tell him you wouldn't mind staying at his place for the week, if he's OK with it.
\>"Dude, I'm totally OK with it! Though, I do have work all week, except Sunday."
\>You're fine with that.
\>"Alright, g'night."
\>The next day, you wake up and see a note on the nightstand.
\>"At work, will be back at lunch. Love you!"
\>That last bit in particular made you audibly "Aww."
\>You really don't have much to do, so you just play vidya until lunch.
\>You hear a knock on the door, and you open it. Behind it (or are YOU behind the door?) is a very tired, sweating Ishmael holding a bag of fast food.
\>"Hey."
\>Hey
\>You let him in, he tosses the bag on the kitchen table, sheds half of his outfit and flops down on the couch.
\>"Ugh... I never thought this shift would end. Some dude had a birthday and brought what seemed like 50 people with him."
\>Yikes.
\>"Yeah. Hey, go ahead and eat dude, I'll be with you in a sec."
\>Sure thing
\>It's a typical burg and tater tots, nothing special.You start eating and Ishmael soon arrives, scarfing down his burg too.
\>He's done before you! He flops back down on the couch, intending to take a nap. You go over and lay on him and rest your head on his chest.
\>Before long, Ishmael is out like a light. You ALMOST consider doing something lewd but you choose not to. 
\>Rather, you fall asleep too.
\>After a while, you both get up and Ishmael has to leave. He quickly gets himself ready and gives you a lil' kiss before leaving.
\>Although he enjoys his job, you can tell his weeks are long. You have a brilliant idea to do something this weekend that'll help him get rid of the stress of this week, ya dig?
\>He gets back home, though less tired than this morning, he's still pooped. He cooks you both dinner and y'all play vidya.
\>Around bedtime, you whisper to him
\>Hey, I got a surprise for you Sunday.
\>"What is it?"
\>You'll see!
\>You give his nose a boop.
\>The week passes, and you learn just how impatient Ishmael is.
\>He keeps subtly and not-so-subtly asking for hints about the surprise Sunday.
\>All you say is "Just wait and see."
\>It drives him crazy, it's really quite adorable.
\>Eventually, Sunday arrives, but before that Ishmael says he'll be hitting up the gym this morning, like REALLY early.
\>OK
\>E X C E L L E N T
\>Sunday morning comes and you wake up pretty early, though Ishmael is still gone, it seems.
\>You're quite excited and you hope Ishmael's been wanting this surprise as much as you.
\>Suddenly, you hear a knock at the door.
\>It's Ishmael.
\>You're greeted with the sight of a big, cute, sweaty slug wearing a tank top and shorts. Said shorts have quite the outline.
\>You say hey to him an a semi-sensual tone, he walks in and sits down.
\>"Sooooo... What's the surprise?"
\>You sit down on his lap and begin stroking his antenna.
\>"What are you doi-"
\>He's blushing, but you get a reaction you did not expect.
\>He makes a really cute noise, then he sticks his tongue out. You stroke 'em some more, eliciting even more cute noises.
\>"Mah tung sthicks out when yu rab mah antenah lik tha."
\>You stop. You'll probably play with those later.
\>You instead go lewder, you stick your hand up his shirt and rub his tum and pecs as your other hand is rubbing his face.
\>"O-Oh. This is the surprise, huh?"
\>Yep.
\>"...I mean. If you wanna, we could..."
\>Of course, that was the surprise!
\>You tell him his weeks seem to be long and stressful, and you thought something like this could... relieve that stress.
\>He isn't quite sure what to say, all he says is a simple,
\>"Aw."
\>You caress him for a moment longer before leaning close to him, he leans towards you.
\>Before you know it, your lips lock and your tounges are twisting.
\>You both get in sort of a daze as you make out...
\>...Well, until the doorbell rings, scaring both you and Ishmael.
\>There's a package at the door.
\>It's from you.
\>"Huh, when did you order this?"
\>Thursday. You tell Ishmael to go ahead and open it.
\>He does. And in it is some high dollar cooking stuff. He looks excited, to say least.
\>"Dude, you didn't have to do this! You know how expensive this stuff is, right?"
\>You nod. You didn't know what to get him, but it seems he really wanted this.
\>He gives you a big hug. It's indeed cute, but Ishmael recently got back from the gym and being shoved face-first into his somewhat sweaty pecs is fueling your lust once more.
\>Your boner touches his.
\>Speaking of, only when he breaks the hug do you realize he has a hardon. You're pretty sure there's a wet spot too.
\>"So... I assume that was part of the surprise?"
\>Yep!
\>He gives you a kiss
\>"Thanks. I... guess we go upstairs or something?"
\>You give him a boop on the nose tell him to stay downstairs for a moment
\>"Oook."
\>You run upstairs and strip down to complete nudity, finally freeing your throbbing cock
\>You playfully toss your underwear and pants at Ishmael, making sure he only sees your head and arm
\>He catches your pants, but your undies land on his face. He sniffs 'em a bit
\>"Mmm... Can I go up now?"
\>Just a second!
\>You grabs a really big but also super soft towel, lay it on his bed, then you lay down on it.
\>You tell him he can come up now.
\>He walks up the stairs and notices your shirt. He enters the bedroom to see...
\>...You laying on his bed wearing nothing but a smile!
\>"O-Oh."
\>He's blushing and looks super flustered, it's really quite cute
\>He seems to get the memo, as he takes off his clothes too, going especially slow when taking off his underwear
\>As he reveals his big, darker-hued, junk you catch a whiff of something. Musk, definitely musk
\>"S-So, how does it look?"
\>Amazing!
\>"Hah... Yours doesn't look to bad either."
\>You admire his nude, muscular body.
\>And his heavy, sweaty balls
\>And his thick, copiously foreskinned cock
\>Ishmael walks up to you and lays on the bed.
\>"So, uh, what are we gonna be doing?"
\>You fondle his balls for a moment before saying he can do whatever he wants.
\>"Really? Hmm..."
\>While he's thinking, you decide to play with his foreskin a bit.
\>You softly pinch it, causing him to make a cute noise. You stretch it some and stick your finger in it, getting your finger really wet with pre.
\>You then give it a lil' nibble before sticking your tongue in it and lapping up the pre.
\>"Mmh... Hey, do you think you could handle taking my dick? It's pretty big..."
\>You stop playing with his foreskin and you tell him you can take it.
\>You lay down and spread your legs, showing off that cute, tight hole of yours. You don't really need lube, Ishmael's dick has this soft, smooth feeling and it's wet with pre.
\>The tip is pressing against your hole, you tell Ishmael to push a little harder. He reluctantly does so.
\>It's in! You let out a yelp as your hole is stretched. Ishmael interprets it as a yelp of pain and immediately leans in and nervously says,
\>"Oh god. Y-You OK?"
\>You tell him you're fine.
\>"OK, just tell me when to stop."
\>You tell him he shouldn't have to worry about that.
\>"You're saying that now..."
\>It'll be fine!
\>"O-Ok..."
\>He slowly thrusts his cock in you, making sure to be careful.
\>His pace picks up, but he's still going rather slow. You tell him to go harder.
\>He, again reluctantly, speeds up.
\>You lean up and softly squeeze his pecs.
\>They're as soft as ever.
\>You knead his pecs as he's fucking you, you tell him to go even faster and give his pecs a good, hard, squeeze for good measure.
\>He, understandably, moans and spurts pre in you.
\>You notice his cock is sliding in and out of you smoothly, as if the pre he's constantly shooting is lubing things up further.
\>Though, you don't notice it for long as you're too busy kneading his soft, sweaty chest
\>With every squeeze of his soft flesh, you feel a throb from his cock.
\>Even though he's the one fucking you, he's like putty in your hands thanks to your treatment of his chest.
\>You hear his moans get louder and louder.
\>It seems he's getting rather close, you are too.
\>"A-Anon, I'm gonna cum!"
\>You tell him you're going to as well.
\>You give him pecs one last squeeze, eliciting a moan from him as he thrusts into you once more.
\>You both shoot your loads, Ishmael shoots ropes into you and you cum on you and him.
\>Eventually, your orgasms die down and you both are cuddling and making out.
\>The both of you shower and you put on some shorts and Ishmael is wearing a tank top and nothing else. He prefers having his junk out.
\>You cuddle and play vidya.
\>"Hey, Anon, I guess you'll be leaving pretty soon, huh?"
\>Yeah.
\>"Do you suppose we'll meet up again sometime? Maybe I could come to your place."
\>Sounds good.
\>You kinda think about things for a moment.
\>You tell him he world works in weird ways.
\>"Hmm?"
\>Meeting your roommate, becoming boyfriends, having sex with him.
\>"Yeah. Just think: If we haven't met I'd just be some dude you'd scroll pass thinking 'Oh he's a total Chad and is probably as straight as a board.'"
\>You chuckle.
\>You tell him you love him and you're glad you both met, and if you'd have known things would turn out like this, you would've asked him out long before now.
\>"Aww, same. Love you too, Anon"
\>Say, Ishmael.
\>"Yeah?"
\>Whaddya got planned for lunch today?
FIN
