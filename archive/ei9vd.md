!!!note -> ğŸª¶  **Library (of /who/LEXandria as anon coined it)**  ğŸª¶ <-
    Here's the list of all the multimedia projects that /who/ collectively worked on for the past year, relative to Mumei - be it streams, outright content or proper creations from anons that are not artworks. It is not only limited to her karaokes, a list of recommendation for the newfriends or a list of collabs that happened in the other holomems channels - you're going to also find the tools in order to record said karaokes and twitterspaces if such occurrences happen in the future (they will and you're going to need it).
