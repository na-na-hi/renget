Oh, the year was two-thousand and nineteen
How I wish I was on /vt/ now
A chuuba debut came up on stream
For the horniest pirate I'd ever seen

Goddamn them all! I had hoped she'd be 
An idol as Yagoo had planned
She'd cause us no yabs, catch no bans
Now I'm a hohny obahshiiz sekshii man
The last of Houshou's Pirate Band

Houshou Marine cried the board
How I wish I was on /vt/ now
For 20 brave simps all gachikois who
Would make for her the Ichimi crew

Goddamn them all! I had hoped she'd be 
An idol as Yagoo had planned
She'd cause us no yabs, catch no bans
Now I'm a hohny obahshiiz sekshii man
The last of Houshou's Pirate Band

The Houshou ship didn't even exist
How I wish I was on /vt/ now
It was all just a cosplay thing for her
And no treasures but the BL books a-plenty were

Goddamn them all! I had hoped she'd be 
An idol as Yagoo had planned
She'd cause us no yabs, catch no bans
Now I'm a hohny obahshiiz sekshii man
The last of Houshou's Pirate Band

On Marine's birthday I caught the stream
How I wish I was on /vt/ now
I yelled out 'shukkou' when I heard her sing
But then a male voice changed everything

Goddamn them all! I had hoped she'd be 
An idol as Yagoo had planned
She'd cause us no yabs, catch no bans
Now I'm a hohny obahshiiz sekshii man
The last of Houshou's Pirate Band

So I opened /ahoy/ on my other screen
How I wish I was on /vt/ now
Marine schizo made another shitpost
This time somehow even worse than most

Goddamn them all! I had hoped she'd be 
An idol as Yagoo had planned
She'd cause us no yabs, catch no bans
Now I'm a hohny obahshiiz sekshii man
The last of Houshou's Pirate Band

It seemed like they all took the bait
How I wish I was on /vt/ now
"Marine's old and fat" the schizo said
"And right now I bet she's pleasuring her boyfriend"

Goddamn them all! I had hoped she'd be 
An idol as Yagoo had planned
She'd cause us no yabs, catch no bans
Now I'm a hohny obahshiiz sekshii man
The last of Houshou's Pirate Band

At length he had o'er a dozen (you)s
How I wish I was on /vt/ now
I tried to ignore but it was no use
By then threads about it were too profuse

Goddamn them all! I had hoped she'd be 
An idol as Yagoo had planned
She'd cause us no yabs, catch no bans
Now I'm a hohny obahshiiz sekshii man
The last of Houshou's Pirate Band

She tweeted out something but far too late
How I wish I was on /vt/ now
Management thought it was salacious
And before long she was on hiatus

Goddamn them all! I had hoped she'd be 
An idol as Yagoo had planned
She'd cause us no yabs, catch no bans
Now I'm a hohny obahshiiz sekshii man
The last of Houshou's Pirate Band

Now here I sit watching old Marine clips
How I wish I was on /vt/ now
Been years and years since we sailed away
And her graduation feels like yesterday

Goddamn them all! I had hoped she'd be 
An idol as Yagoo had planned
She'd cause us no yabs, catch no bans
Now I'm a hohny obahshiiz sekshii man
