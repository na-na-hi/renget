==!~**IMPORTANT NOTE**~!==
At some point during Feb 17 2024, **the original document** (https://rentry.org/nijidoki/)  **was deleted by a different party**. If, and when, this document is reposted, !~I do not claim any future edits as my own - even if the same url is reused~!.  *(see /nijidoki3 + /nijidoki4)*

Here are archived links to [nijidoki (the main document)](https://web.archive.org/web/20240217105229/https://rentry.org/nijidoki) and [nijidoki2 (the supporting document)](https://web.archive.org/web/20240217113228/https://rentry.org/nijidoki2) in the final forms I left them in.

Thank you for everyone who took the time to read the original document. I would like to address some final points:
- I stand by what I wrote. I never claimed 'neutrality' (an impossibility), but attempted an essay as moderate, fair and source-backed as possible, based on the public statements so far. At the end of the day, the only parties who may ever know the true sequence of events are ANYCOLOR, the NIJISANJI EN livers and Selen.
- I hope the document has succeeded in its goal to invite more critical thought & nuance to the ongoing discussion. It helps no one to disregard one 'side' entirely before properly reading and thinking through the available information.
- The document was written entirely by myself, in my own words. I crowdsourced videos, timestamps and links as supporting evidence after the text was written.

I reiterate the conclusions of the document:

NIJISANJI EN can suffer from incompetence in their management and PR, AND the livers can wish to stay in the company, strive for improvement and rally for a better 2024. Selen can have suffered intense mental stress leading up to her termination BUT this does not immediately implicate her coworkers as malicious bullies who deserve eternal punishment. !~There is likely no black-and-white here: both statements from ANYCOLOR and Selen may hold weight~!.

If you read until now, thank you. You may disagree with what I have written entirely – and it’s simply not feasible for me to cover the expanse of evidence, speculation and hatred that has unraveled so far. But I ask you to try and have a critical view on the situation. Apply logic and reason, don’t just fall into the herd mentality (as multiple livers have recently stated). Think about whether it’s right to trust crackpot /vt/ narratives which claim certain livers are actually managers running the company who pick and choose opportunities; think about whether you have actually watched these livers, whether you have watched Selen, and what discussions have been allowed to happen in the community when it’s not under the spotlight of thousands of drama vultures.

Do these people care about the livers under NIJISANJI? Do they even care about Selen/Dokibird? Most importantly: do they care about the truth, or do they care about being right and silencing anyone who disagrees by weaponizing someone else’s mental illness as a complete shield against criticism & valid concerns?

The world has listened to every word Selen has had to say, but has refused to take a single statement made by NIJISANJI EN – not even the company, but the 32 livers under this branch – at face value. Do you really think all of these people are being held hostage by a mean and evil company, silenced from showing support for someone who was their friend for 2.5-years if there wasn’t a reason for them not to?

**At the very least, everyone involved in the situation has requested an end to the harassment.**

**Please listen.**

####criticisms of NIJISANJI are symptomatic of how Japanese vtubing corporations function e.g. Hololive & Holostars
- Axel from Holostars: "The money you guys give me... what do I use it for? A lot of the things I use my money on are the music projects I've been cooking up." [(clip source)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOETKaBBlR8)
- Marine from Hololive talking about project costs: "As far as what we plan and make ourselves, it's all our own expense. The management pays for what they plan and make, but we pay for everything we plan ourselves... I got a lot so I want to make something big and good, so I'm not looking to profit from that. I don't think of it that way in the first place, because I make it with what I get from everybody else." [(clip source)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUTso5qunJg)
- Moona from Hololive talked about the company did not cover her travel costs for HoloFes or home 3D equipment [(full-size image)](https://i.imgur.com/OOzsEff.png)
 ![Moona explaining how her company did not cover her travel costs for HoloFes](https://i.imgur.com/i2kmBY3.png)
- Moona also spoke about saving money to buy a house, but always ended up spending it on projects: "Because for those kinds of projects, like song covers in particular, I have to pay for these things by myself, right? For the instrumnts, the recordings, the mixing, the illustrations, the animation, I pay them myself." [(clip source)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDzlayOiVro)

**- similarly, reasons why ANYCOLOR is so strict on copyright:**
- In Japan, big for-profit organisations like Holo and NIJI have to be especially careful when it comes to copyright compared to independent streamers. Hololive previously experienced being copyright struck, resulting in a number of videos across Hololive channels being privated. On another instance, an apology was previously also issued to Nintendo for failure to comply with streaming guidelines. [(source)](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2020-07-31/virtual-youtuber-agency-hololive-apologizes-for-uploading-videos-without-copyright-permission/.162427) This is not a dig at Hololive, but an example of how seriously corporations take copyright & due process in Japan - always better to be safe than sorry when one person can cause problems for the entire company, even with the bureaucracy this necessitates

####NIJISANJI black company financially

**- claim: Selen lost $15,000 making her 'Last Cup of Coffee' cover and made no profit last year because she spent $200,000CAD on projects - this is ANYCOLOR's fault**
  - Maria: "Each cover is minimum $3-4k up to $8-9k, sometimes over. All in all, !~making covers is not profitable. I don't do it because it's profitable, because it's not~!... I mostly do it for myself, because I enjoy singing and by doing covers I'm able to see myself improve." [(clip source)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwFpiXLeL_8)
- Maria further breaks down the cost of cover songs and emphasises that they are not for-profit: "Do you know how much a cover song costs? Do you know how many cover songs I've done up until now? ... 90% of the time, cover songs are not monetized. So it's 100% in the red." [(1:18:21 in VOD)](https://www.youtube.com/live/I3AHzppxjZg?feature=shared&t=4701)

**- debunking the claim that NIJISANJI livers do not profit from the company**
- Rosemi's stream titled ['I QUIT MY JOB TODAY!'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wymzM1jFsag) because streaming was profitable enough for her to stop being an office lady & stream full-time
- likewise, Pomu was able to quit her job to stream full-time [(6:48 in VOD)](https://www.youtube.com/live/XsbJK2pINv0?feature=shared&t=408)
- Claude: "I've been super fortunate to not only cover my expenses, pick up upgrades and on top of that, put more towards my student loans... That was fucking awesome, and now I feel comfortable doing more stuff and having more fun." [[30:10 in VOD]](https://www.youtube.com/live/CmoPLUYAM-8?feature=shared&t=1810)
- Kunai about how NIJISANJI paid for their flights to NIJIFES and fancy dinner with the CEO in 2 separate streams: "NIJI please, I know you flew me out at no cost to myself just to give me the experience, just so that I could write on the wall and meet other people, but do it again question mark?" [[56:18 in VOD]](https://www.youtube.com/live/yJi0yv9lg_0?feature=shared&t=3378) + "It was really nice of them to treat us to a really fancy dinner. That was really cool of NIJISANJI EN to fly us out and do that." [[33:16 in VOD]](https://www.youtube.com/live/TG5NB9rqwa0?feature=shared&t=1996)
- Aia was able to pay off her student loan less than a year after debuting in NIJI [[36:07 in VOD]](https://www.youtube.com/live/69TAoSWG7Sw?feature=shared&t=2164)
- Doppio: "You guys have given me so much financial freedom that it's an absolute blessing. I feel so lucky. Never in my life have I felt so free to do whatever I want, and a lot of it is because of you guys. Thank you so much for supporting me financially to the point where I never have to worry about finances again." [(2:48:37 in VOD)](https://youtu.be/-vJvJbJS31g?t=10117)

####Livers speaking out against NIJISANJI 'black company' claims
- Luca: "When people shit-talk the company we work for, I don't like that... It doesn't make us feel better too, are you kidding me? It demotivates us. Obviously we've voiced out our own problems, I think everyone has. I've had my fair share of things off-stream that I have problems with. I can be upset about it, but in reality, is it really bad? Would I prefer to not stream anymore, to quit doing this? Absolutely not... Every workplace has its bad stuff. I've worked all sorts of jobs, nothing compares." !~"I signed a contract that dictates everything I'm supposed to do, not do. I can't be mad at that, I signed it. That's all I have to say about it."~!  [[3:57:06 in VOD]](https://www.youtube.com/live/FS0EFV38ppE?feature=shared&t=14226)
- Millie addresses NIJISANJI black company allegations at length [[clip source]](https://youtu.be/5GqrsRdks08)

**- claim: NIJISANJI managers frequently take over their livers' accounts**
- Ren denies this, in response to mass speculation that management forced livers to retweet/support the video statement on Elira's channel: [[tweet link]](https://twitter.com/RenZott0/status/1757216876562972729)
![Ren's tweet](https://i.imgur.com/LJO2b2W.png)

####Selen's past conflicts with management
- Selen: "I have written very heated messages before off-stream. I have let my temper get the best of me and wrote very heated messages in the past... I've shown these messages to people and they're like, holy shit. That's a little bit too intense Selen." [[clip source]](https://youtu.be/JKKWlrZikHc) [[image link]](https://i.imgur.com/Tlcb9db.png)

**- examples of Selen's tweets that paint NIJISANJI in a bad light by omitting context or lying**
- Selen's privated cover
		![Communication from Selen's manager regarding her privated music video](https://i.imgur.com/svHDNv1.png)
- Selen's Fall Guys tournament
		![Selen fall guys tweet](https://i.imgur.com/wmsdIId.png)
		- vs Selen's follow-up statement on stream: "I messed up earlier tweeting about my excitement and starting my plans with organizing the tournament as I assumed my old approval for it was still in fact there, since I've been in discussion for it before the Puyo Tetris tournament. But I did get in trouble since it wasn't finalized or the new date when I thought it was." [(source)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G_G8mF4FVM)
- Selen's outfit design contest [[full-size image]](https://i.imgur.com/4Iz3JlG.png) [[tweet link]](https://twitter.com/Selen_Tatsuki/status/1656204691699798020)
		- Selen posted this without proper authorisation by management, as shown by the need to backtrack and change prizes later on. Concerns were also raised about setting a precedent in which livers should fund their new outfit designs
		- It's important to note that livers do not pay for new outfits, a claim Selen herself previously debunked - there was only monetary reward offered because Selen changed the rules to involve prizes, making it a personal, non-company-funded project
		![Selen's tweets about negotiating with management over her contest](https://i.imgur.com/yQglivb.png)


####vs other livers' experiences with management
(NOTE: this does not automatically invalidate Selen's experiences with her managers. Rather, these are some examples to dispute the generic 'black company' accusations which paint management as a whole as malicious and uncaring to livers' concerns.)
- Kunai received a handwritten note & dango from her manager, congratulating her on debut [[2:21:29 in VOD]](https://www.youtube.com/live/yJi0yv9lg_0?feature=shared)
- Ver: "I think it's very much worth noting our manager is incredibly sweet... Our manager cried when all of us met. She saw us meet and she just cried. After we did our parts in NIJIFES, we looked back and she was crying. It was one of the sweetest things I've ever seen in my life." [[50:00 in VOD]](https://www.youtube.com/live/3Iwl4j4GXKY?feature=shared&t=3000)
- Elira and Finana make Pomu so happy with the help of staff: "When the organisers told us that Beatmario was also going to be a guest at the con, Pomu was like, 'Oh my god I love Beatmario so much!' so then our staff organised this surprise, so Pomu could be surprised by Beatmario (on stream)" [[6:26 in clip]](https://youtu.be/zduuUVvt1Tw?feature=shared&t=386)

####additional information removed from '7: An important note'
NOTE: this is not 'EVIDENCE' or a source.
*This section was previously in the main document, and covers references to Selen's past mentions of mental health diagnosis. I still believe this may offer important context to understanding why certain actions & behaviors may have happened, and was included not to demonise her or incite hate against her, but to suggest how both sides can co-exist without being clearly 'wrong'. However, this is a more speculative argument compared to the rest of this document, and relies on assumptions about her current mental health based on statements from 3-4 years ago, which may no longer hold true.*

I am not claiming that her allegations are false, reducing her to her disorder (there is no confirmation that she has all, if any, of these traits because of it), or even using it as a scapegoat explanation. Obviously, a simplistic list of symptoms cannot encapsulate her lived experiences or explain away the hardships she has faced.

I do not mean this maliciously. I do not believe Selen is a bad person. Instead, I truly believe this may provide an important perspective on many of her patterns of behavior in the past 2 years, including impulsive and drastic reactions she later regrets, overspending on personal projects, and feeling pushed to the edge in the days following the privatization of her cover and influx of messages of confusion and worry by other livers.

People constantly state her attempt as concrete evidence of active bullying from within the company, and this is a suggestion of how this may not be the case.
