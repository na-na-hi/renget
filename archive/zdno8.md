>This'll be the first time he sees me in a kimono
>The fact that I'm not as nervous about that as I was shows that he's helped me grow as a person
>Still, I hope he likes it
>Wait a minute...
>Is that him?
>I wasn't expecting him to be wearing one too
>...It looks really good on him
>"Wow, you look nice in a kimono", he says
>"Thanks. I wasn't expecting you to be wearing one too."
>"Well, since everyone else would be wearing one, I decided to rent one. As they say in America, when in Rome..."
>"Do as the Romans do", I finish for him
>He smiles
>"I'm rubbing off on you"
>'Oh, you have no idea how badly I want us to rub off on each other', I think
>"Seriously though", he says "I really appreciate the help you've been giving me with reading and writing Japanese. You're the tutor I needed."
>I blush. "Thank you."
>If only he knew how much he's been helping me
>...Maybe he does and is just too modest to bring it up
>I wish he could stay here permanently
>Or I could go with him
