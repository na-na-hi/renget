>childhood friend
>you two were inseparable
>practically brothers
>down to sharing a bed when you slept over
>parents thought it was cute
>played doctor in the woods behind his house, truth or dare with some other kids when you had parties
>you were human and him a giraffe
>the family had come to your neighborhood and was just glad Devin had a friend
>then came the day you had to move
>both of you were devastated
>parents wanted to enroll you in a new high-school that year too
>Devin made a confession to you that you almost hadn't considered real
>he liked liked you
>two boys liking each other like that?
>you had no idea how to deal with it but hugged him back before you left
>across the country you still talked on the phone
>that was at least a blessing
>dumb teenager stuff took you away more and more but you still talked
>you'd thought about what he said occasionally
>about like liking you
>made you feel guilty when with a girl
>put your love life on hold
>you made some new friends here and there
>but none like Devin
>so here you were moving back, going to a local college
>you wanted space from the family, your independence
>Devin was working hard to support his family
>3 jobs
>Jesus
>so you decided to reconnect
>which he loved
>you hadn't considered to get a new picture of him
>you certainly didn't expect a lean feminine giraffe a head and a half taller than you
>he pulled you up into a huge hug

>Devin had practically yanked you up off the ground
>he squeed 
>actually squeed
>hadn't heard his voice since you left for the move, all your communication was done over chat rooms and game lobbies
>his voice hadn't dropped to a baritone 
>it was still the same chipper tone you'd remembered
>after squeezing the air from your lungs he set you down
>you decided to go out for pizza to reminisce 
>you were paying
>no way in hell was the boy juggling 3 jobs going to pay
>you insisted 
>as it turned out he worked as a delivery boy for that same pizza place
>the boss gave you a discount because of Devin
>that was a pleasant surprise
>as you all ate you took time to look over the other guy
>without trying to look like a creep of course
>anthros weren't exactly rare but he in particular was
>it was unreal how much he'd grown 
>had a slightly longer neck
>that accounted for a bit of his height 
>his curly short mop of blonde hair was at least exactly like when he was a kid
>it had some brown in it back then though
>two tiny horns poked out of the top of his head
>his ears were kind of droopy, except when you spoke
>you noticed that almost immediately 
>it was actually cute
>his eyes were hazel and still very vibrant
>even with all his work and responsibilities he still was upbeat
>it was practically infectious 
>he was enjoyable company to have around compared to most 
>actually seemed to hang on your every word
>the 3 jobs didn't seem to help his social life much more than your studies
>so you were on equal ground there
>you knew he tried to make time to play games with you
>so apparently your social lives just revolved around playing video games with each other
>ge took time to savor his spinach stromboli before continuing the conversation 
>he didn't quite have his parents' accent but occasionally it peeked into a sentence
>you insisted you pay for the check, despite his protests
>for all his height and reach he still wasn't able to snatch the paper from your hands
>playing keepaway almost had him lunging forward across the table
>but there was no way he was paying after all the work he does
>he actually pouted at that
>"it's really no big deal"
>however making up for lost time with your best friend made up for it
>plus you reminded him he provided the discount
>that did seem to make him relent
>he got out of the booth and you were still in awe at how big he'd gotten
>he had almost a pear shape going on with his waist to hips ratio 
>must be genetics or something because you remembered his mom looking similar
>he was pretty lean otherwise 
>no doubt because of all the running around
>he had to head off to work at a nearby motel afterwards
>he worked the desk 
>apparently he worked security overnights for the industrial park too
>hard to imagine him trying to apprehend someone
>you did give him your address and parted ways
>he had a skip in his step as he got in his old beat up car, making sure to crouch to get in
>the rest of the week was quiet
>getting used to college courses left little time to relax
>your days became hectic
>darting around campus barely allowed you time
>to say nothing of looking for a job
>your parents weren't going to let you freeze to death or die of starvation but you wanted to do better
>you had used the money they gave you for the down payment on this studio apartment but you didn't ask for any more
>they were helping with college payments as is
>even if it was some shitty part time work
>after a week of searching it was annoying
>no one wanted to call back and barely any interviews 
>you eventually shared this with your friend
>Devin would see if any of his jobs were hiring
>"it's no big deal to get my hoof in the door"
>even a pizza boy was something
>though night security wouldn't be bad either
>same with the hotel job
>night work wouldn't interfere with your day to day classes
>so that was on the table 
>granted, it all depended on what approached you
>when you mentioned your pantry becoming more and more bare he offered to bring over a pizza that night 
>the idea was nice
>but you didn't want him spending all his money on you
>"worst case scenario it's extra at the end of the night or I tell the boss I accidentally sat on it"
>you didn't want him getting in trouble
>"Mr Greco-Roman knows I'm clumsy. plus pizza is cheap to make. he wont miss one"
>well ok
>you felt it only right to offer to let him hang out if he was bringing food
>"sounds fine with me"
>he was over around 10 and sure enough he brought 2 pizzas
>"hope you don't mind they're a little cold"
>food was food
>he brought sausage for you and pineapple for himself
>"what I don't finish is yours too"
>so there was that
>you played some video games together 
>he made a really girly excited noise when he saw you still had your old system
>that made the choice of games easy
>"I really don't play much modern stuff nowadays"
>with how busy he was it made sense
>you decided to get into a fighting game
>the urge to let him win was strong but you had your pride
>plus he wouldn't let you hear the end of it
>you remember one time as a kid play wrestling and he wouldn't let go of the fact he pinned you
>so poor winner
>sometimes
>you both lost track of time and he freaked out when he saw it was 2 AM
>he had work in the morning but the drive would be a killer that late
>you did the obvious thing
>offered up your couch
>your apartment wasn't much but you had room for a bed and couch at least
>"thankyouthankyouthankyou"
>he was genuinely touched
> you slapped the remains of the pizza in the mini fridge and wrapped up your little party
>he didn't have a toothbrush but you let him use your mouthwash
>he was genuinely grateful
>both of you said your goodnights and you found yourself drifting off to bed easily 
>the next morning your first sight was Devin curled up on the couch
>you hadn't considered how he'd be taller than the couch last night
>judging by how he draped himself over it you figured it was uncomfortable 
>well at least he didn't have to drive last night
>breakfast was last night's cold pizza 
>it had sausage on it so it counted as a breakfast food
>apparently that woke Devin and did this weird little yawn and stretch thing 
>"morning"
>you said morning back and offered him your shower which he gladly accepted
>"I've got spare clothes in my car, give me just a second"
>you did and he was back with an outfit 
>he had work in about 3 hours so you let him stick around 
>you had classes before his work so you asked him to lock up when he leaves
>he was really grateful to you and kept constantly thanking you
>it's a shower though so no big deal
>you headed out and he hopped in the shower

>coming back to the place was a little bit of a letdown
>true to his word, Devin locked up
>so the place was back to being quiet
>having a friend around again made you feel more comfortable
>at least you could unwind after classes
>you went to grab a shower and the hot water was a relief
>you took your time and eventually your muscles felt relaxed enough that you decided to call it quits
>you got a change of clothes
>you could have sworn you had more underwear than what was in the dresser
>maybe they were in the hamper
>you texted Devin to ask about the job 
>it took about a half hour to receive a reply
>he'd probably been driving
>"got you a foot in the door at the night security and pizza place"
>well that sounded good
>you'd hopefully get one 
>or maybe both if you could juggle it
>Devin could do it so why not you
>you thanked him for looking out and thanked him for coming over
>"no problem. I had fun"
>you remarked that he was always welcome to hang out, even if your place wasn't perfect
>"really?"
>that reply sounded hopeful
>of course he was welcome
>"thank you. hope you don't get sick of pizza :)"
>of course you couldn't get too sick of pizza
>there was still a bit left of the remaining pies
>you figured you'd ask if he was free to hang out that weekend
>"friday night I'm stuck at the security job"
>an idea occurred
>you were extremely bored 
>so could you come and hang out there?
>"it's sort of unusual. maybe? I usually work the night shift by myself."
>it was funny thinking about the same guy who got scared of spiders running night guard
>granted he could not be scared of spiders nowadays 
>you pointed out he could count it as showing you around for work
>it was true
>plus you honestly didn't have much to do on a friday night
>so that was something to look forward to
>you texted him that this time you'd bring something for his dinner
>he practically lit up through text
>"oh my goodness you don't need to do that"
>well not you needed to 
>especially after he brought pizza
>granted you'd probably bring like Chinese or something
>money was sent aside for that in the next couple days
>it was good to have something to do at least
>veggie stir fry seemed like the best bet for him
>you got pork fried rice
>you'd just split spring rolls and some lo mien 
>sure enough night shift was a solo affair for him
>Devin had to wear a uniform and everything 
>you tried not to poke too much fun considering you'd probably be wearing one soon
>the mall cop look wasn't flattering
>apparently he was allowed a taser and that was about it
>not like much happens around town
>you asked him about the job before you dug in
>he was eyeing the food like a hungry dog
>he thanked you profusely before he snatched a spring roll
>he sat down in a weary chair and went through some of it
>they didn't have cameras or anything that high-tech
>it was just occasionally walk a round around the warehouses with a flashlight
>"I'd be the guy in the movies that hears a noise"
>true
>you listened intently as he went over procedures 
>nothing complex
>usually spent most of his time in the tiny booth on his phone
>"in the winter it's actually sort of cozy. I even have a space heater."
>well there was that
>all in all sounded fairly simple
>you'd seen him flee a bug more than once though
>the thought of him trying to be tough here was humorous 
>you enjoyed your food in relative peace and he did his second round of the night
>"I'll be back in about twenty minutes. there's a charger for you phone if you want and leave me a couple spring rolls, please?"
>he was past the point of trying the puppy dog eyes trick on you
>bit too old to fall for that
>that's how you both ended up falling out of a tree
>you did as asked though
>he disappeared around the warehouses shortly after and you waited patiently
>if anything came up he had his phone and you had yours
>overall the job seemed easy but you didn't know how he didn't get paranoid out here
>trying not to jump at every shadow as you waited was difficult 
>it was close to midnight and he was only on second patrol
>at least you could maybe get schoolwork done out here as a bonus
>when he pulled open the door suddenly you flinched
>"well, nothing to report. now I can goof off for like an hour."
>oh you could definitely get used to this
>Devin was doing better at this job than you had guessed
>you were more jumpy than him
>that was a surprise
>sometimes people change
>he was still pretty much Devin though
>that was a relief
>it was good to be around your friend again
>he was flipping through his phone to show you funny shit now
>must have flipped too far because you were greeted with a shirtless human 
>a male human
>it took a millisecond for him and he kind of got this weird look on his face and tried to excuse himself for another patrol
>he wasn't due to do one for another half hour or so
>but you let him
>well Devin was still kind of girly
>the gay thing didn't exactly surprise you any
>him saying he liked liked you all those years ago was weird
>now that you knew how stuff worked you figured no big deal if he was gay
>you didn't get to see Devin panicking behind the warehouse trying to brainstorm playing off that image
>the giraffe wasn't even doing rounds so much as he was pacing back and forth silently cursing
>because he couldn't keep separate picture galleries 
>you were unaware and patiently waited
>what Devin was unaware of was in his rush to get away from the conversation he left his phone in the booth
>Devin finally realized his mistake and worked through entire scenarios 
>you no doubt were checking out his phone
>he was utterly convinced 
>you'd see his contact nickname for you
>all of it
>you'd find the selfies he was saving just for that one possible occasion it would be appropriate to send them
>Devin couldn't even be scared of the patrol 
>he wanted someone to kill him right now
>there needed to be a serial killer lurking in the bushes
>being trapped at work right now meant he couldn't flee
>he'd have to come back to the booth and you
>there was a chance you would just leave
>maybe disgust or boredom
>he didn't know 
>right now he was inwardly screaming
>his fear was unfounded
>you hadn't touched his phone despite the curiosity 
>you felt like it was in bad taste
>if anything you were getting a bit worried he was gone for as long as he was
>going out to find him had crossed your mind
>it had been about forty five minutes 
>after a bit of debate you closed the booth door behind you and tried calling his name quietly
>the search was short-lived
>only about five minutes of walking around
>you heard an "eep" from around a warehouse

>you followed the source of that noise to see Devin trying to scamper into a window 
>trying being the key word
>for someone as bottom heavy as him, agility wasn't his strong suit
>he tried playing it off as stretching on the window sill
>that was very strange 
>he acted completely nonchalant 
>Devin was never known for confidence and couldn't pull off the smooth act
>you were confused but he could do him
>you pointed out he left his phone in the booth
>"you have it on you?"
>when you replied you left it where he had you could see the boy relax instantly 
>he just completely loosened up
>internally Devin still worried maybe you lied but for the moment took your word
>he tried to hide how erratic he was just moments before
>Devin kept trying to play it cool on the walk back to the booth
>while ignoring the shirtless guy elephant in the room best he could
>there was an urge to tease him but you decided against it
>if Devin wasn't bringing it up you wouldn't either
>you both settled in for the rest of his shift
>with how chilly it was getting he'd probably limit his next visits which was fine with you
>for a while he was very timid
>very noticeable shift from how gregarious he normally was
>you didn't pry 
>you just tried to get him back to talking
>it really wasn't a big deal he was gay
>you weren't exactly big on girls at the moment too
>but you didn't want to make it like some very special episode 
>it was hard to articulate 
>maybe if you bopped him in the arm
>that got him perked up
>small victory
>you decided to catch up and ask how his family was
>"they're fine"
>he didn't elaborate much more 
>this had become awkward 
>so you decided on an ice breaker
>neither of you had gotten into your fortune cookies
>those ears popped up 
>you handed him his cookie and opened your own
>"love can last a lifetime, if you want it to"
>well that was kind of corny
>you heard a gasp and realized he was reading yours
>you asked what his said and he dismissed it as some generic saying about spring
>"so, who's the lucky girl?"
>he seemed curious but looked down at his hooves 
>well, you didn't have a girl
>hadn't in like years
>you were honest about your dating life
>you were a bachelor with not a lot of prospects
>"oh really?"
>his head whipped up to look and you and there was a look I'm his eyes you couldn't place
>that seemed to perk him up briefly
>"I mean, uh, that's a shame."
>he seemed relax a little and eventually went back to his default perky mood
>thankfully the phone thing seemed to be a distant memory for him
>although he now seemed hesitant to share his phone 
>you weren't going to bring it up if he wasn't though
>the rest of his shift seemed to fly by
>you offered to let him hang out at your place that day and he practically skipped to his car
>granted the hanging out would probably amount to passing out but that was fine
>he asked to shower before he rested and it wasn't like you were saying no
>you fell asleep almost right away
>the morning was uneventful
>he was up before you
>he had coffee going and was attempting to make breakfast 
>attempt being the keyword 
>as girly as he seemed talent in the kitchen wasn't part of it
>you had cracked one eye slightly open at hearing a whispered curse at an egg
>why was he cooking in just a shirt and underwear?
>he usually wore pants
>you rose from bed and he jumped and spun to face you when he noticed
>"sorry. I just wanted to do something…"
>he poked his pointer fingers together as he looked regretful
>"I didn't realize the toaster would be that powerful"
>the black shingles on the plate behind him told the story
>well at least he didn't burn the place down
>"scrambled eggs will be ready in a minute though"
>his eyes grew wide and he turned back to the tiny stove to tend to them
>you grabbed a mug of coffee and sat back down on the bed
>you asked what his schedule was today
>apparently he was shopping around for a fourth job
>holy shit he was going to kill himself at that pace
>"is your family that bad off? can I help?"
>he paused for a moment before he realized he was stalled and replied 
>"no no. it'll be ok. I'm ok. eggs are ready."
>he handed you a plate
>he at least used cheese in them
>toast could barely be salvaged but it was edible
>he got away from the job discussion as much as possible
>"what are you doing today?"
>he sat down next to you on the bed and poked at his food a little before judging it safe
>you had a late class but nothing else
>the morning was relatively free if he wanted to hang out
>which he accepted enthusiastically 
>the morning was pretty much all video games
>he was chipper even when failing spectacularly 
>Devin even did that thing where he'd lean around while playing
>constantly bumping into you during Virtua Fighter matches
>it was nice to have him around again
>actually relaxed a little 
>you could tell he was the same too
>granted he was always chipper
>but around you like this he actually lightened up
>he at least stopped acting weird 
>it was good to have a friendly face around 
>unfortunately after a few hours he had to head out and got his pants on
>you made plans to see him that Sunday
>going though the rest of week flew by until you met him at the hotel after he was free
>he seemed to have dressed fancier for this occasion

>perhaps it was the hotel job requiring it
>Devin was decked out in what appeared to be a cheap suit and tie
>blue fabric looked strange next to his orange fur
>at least to your eye
>he paid it no mind
>still Devin 
>he knocked a mug off his desk with his hips
>he flew into a panic and almost grabbed the broken glass before stopping himself 
>"just give me a minute to clean this up."
>he rushed off from the lobby and came back with a broom and dustpan
>you held the dustpan and he swept and fretted
>the other shift was there by the time it was all cleaned up 
>the rest of the day was yours
>you two headed over to your place to drop off his car
>you figured you'd be generous and offer the drive around the town
>he had a change of clothes in his car and got dressed in your place before coming back down
>just a t shirt and jeans, nothing fancy
>not that there was a lot to do
>didn't even have a mall
>there was still a mom and pop movie theater for cheap and a bowling alley
>both had been around since you were kids
>Devin dragged you to see a Power Rangers movie when you were both little 
>the bowling alley had good nachos if you remembered right
>you just figured staying inside playing video games was fun, but you came back here for a reason
>you were glad main street still had the same small town charm from when you left it
>apparently intentional on the part of the town
>no obnoxious tapas bars or overpriced novelties like some places
>just the same diner you'd seen for ages and said bowling alley and theater
>it would be a long shot if the theater still had the same arcade cabinets but the way things looked it might
>you hadn't taken a lot of time to reintroduce yourself to this town but Devin gave you the perfect excuse
>you talked with him a little about town, seeing if there was news
>"diner changed hands to the owner's kid. remember Kevin from school? that's him."
>he tried thinking back on anything else major
>"they're talking about putting some developments out on the town limits."
>that was new
>hopefully it wouldn't change up the town too much
>the hotel Devin worked at was pretty new so maybe they planned to build up more
>he struggled to think of more news
>by then you'd arrived at a parking lot just off main street so it was good timing
>popcorn and drinks were amazingly cheap
>tickets were the same
>the theater played older stuff out of circulation so they no doubt don't worry too much about overcharging to keep afloat
>you paid for the stuff as a courtesy, with Devin thanking you profusely 
>he was bashful accepting the food and drink but soon relaxed again
>the place had seen better days but it was the same as it always had been
>you'd almost picked up front but Devin got self conscious with his height 
>both of you agreed to a back corner
>you pretty much had the theater to yourselves 
>after settling in you made the mistake that would change everything
>in the dark you reached for popcorn the giraffe boy held 
>in his lap
>you weren't looking
>multiple things happened all at once
>you realized instantly you had a handful of dick
>Devin realized fairly quickly too judging by how he arched his back and moaned
>that…
>what the fuck did you do now?

>you whipped your hand back and Devin instinctively hid his long face in his hands
>"oh my God," he whimpered 
>you'd honked his junk and he made the most whorish reaction possible
>it was hard to focus on the movie 
>you really wished you'd grabbed popcorn just a few moments ago
>you tried not to think about the noise he'd made
>or how he felt through his pants
>he was your friend
>he was another guy
>but that was a sort of awakening in you you were unprepared for
>was it ok if it was Devin?
>the giraffe boy and you didn't make eye contact for the next ten minutes or so
>the silence hung in the air 
>punctuated by the Arnold movie you two had picked
>what do you say?
>there was no easy path here
>you stole a glance and saw he glanced back through his hands
>you were glad he at least didn't bolt
>when you were both dumb teenagers you could have played this off
>his ears drooped on his head as you made eye contact
>did you say you were sorry? 
>was that the right answer?
>it didn't feel right
>silently, you worked through your feelings
>maybe… he wanted that? 
>that wasn't a bad noise he made
>he didn't reprimand you
>maybe
>maybe you should just take the leap
>if it was Devin it was fine
>you weren't into some giant meat head guy
>Devin was different 
>he was cute like a girl
>played video games better than one though
>so you decided damn the torpedoes 
>fuck it
>finally you spoke and he nearly jumped
>you asked if that was a good or bad mistake
>he was a little shy in responding
>but finally he spoke up
>"a good one," he squeaked out
>well there was that
>you were both adults, you could handle this like adults
>you agreed with him and you could practically see all the tension melt off of him
>"really?"
>you nodded
>if it was Devin it was OK
>maybe that little confession in the woods all those years ago was still dangling over your head
>you weren't going to start banging in the empty movie theater but why not go for it
>you leaned up and over and kissed him on the cheek and he heated up
>he squeaked but didn't fight it
>that was your first real kiss with someone that you gave a shit about
>he returned the favor with a clumsy kiss on your lips
>your arm draped around his shoulder and you two quickly forgot the movie
>now if it was Devin you'd prefer it 
>you didn't turn to frenching in the dark theater
>that was too sudden
>this was testing the waters
>while you were both guys you had no idea how to approach this and didn't want to screw it up
>you didn't want to lose a friend if you fucked it up
>though maybe Devin wanted to further it
>he didn't seem to yearn to take the lead
>despite being tall enough he had to lean down to kiss you he sort of let you be I charge 
>was he the girl here?
>had to be 
>Devin didn't scream "take charge and kick ass"
>you didn't know how the gay thing worked because you'd never assumed you'd do this
>so you two just slowly kissed while trying not to draw too much attention
>he kissed better than a girl that much you figured out
>just very tender and passionate
>like this was the center of his world
>his face made kisses very unconventional 
>not bad
>just different than with a human
>you broke briefly to breathe
>in between breaths you asked how he was so good at that
>he stammered and fumbled through a non-answer 
>he briefly attempted to break away and try to not look you in the eye but your hand gently pulled him back by his neck
>he was no doubt self conscious about his slightly longer neck, considering his habit of turtleneck sweaters since he was a kid
>now the graceful exposed connection was a weak point
>just not in the way he thought
>he melted at that touch
>"I've never really… kissed"
>he mumbled the rest of the answer
>you could barely make it out as him admitting virginity
>you weren't exactly a Casanova yourself 
>took you a second or two so come clean about that
>"but… how?"
>he was genuinely shocked as you pulled him into another round of kisses
>he had made your sexual orientation clear for you now
>the experimenting was a success in your mind
>this might be part of the reason you didn't go far with girls
>"seriously though."
>he broke the kiss this time
>"you've never done anything?"
>sure as you could be
>"and you're doing this with me?"
>you buried yourself against his neck and he smelled like perfume
>something flowery and sweet but not too strong
>he had known just how much to use
>"I think I'm dreaming," he muttered
>he rested his head on yours 
>you were keenly aware of how tall he was
>it took him a little coaxing to get the courage to embrace you
>"you don't regret this? now is your chance"
>sure this was unusual but it felt right
>you didn't regret it
>"no take backs"
>he almost reminded you of when you were both kids then and there
>the seating in the theater made a full hug awkward but you two managed 
>"I'm definitely dreaming. well I'll take what I can get. it's a good dream"
>you could feel him a pout a little 
>he really was worried he was going to wake up
>so you reminded him of how you had to move and his little confession
>he was shocked
>he broke the embrace to look at you
>"oh my God you remembered that?"
>there was a twinkle in his eye
>I had stuck with you for most of your life after, in the background but it was there
>he looked genuinely touched
>he had to look away for a second
>"sorry, I just didn't expect that"
>you laid out that this was still all new to you
>being with a guy you meant
>you were thankful the theater gave you the privacy for this moment
>you guessed it would be different seeing each other naked now, as opposed to when you two played doctor
>he got all bashful again and you laughed at seeing him at a loss for words
>after a moment he laughed with you
>"I guess you're right on that. but we can take it slow."
>slow was good
>not that you weren't keenly aware of the end goal here
>but that would give you time to sort through all this
>as opposed to just diving headfirst into the deep end with water wings still on
>you could see the relief in him now
>he must have been holding onto this since that confession
>so you held his hand in yours while you two came down 
>his hand was bigger but he accepted your fingers intertwining with his without struggle
>like puzzle pieces perfectly cut to match 
>the rest of the movie flew by as you decided to pay more attention to each other
>you'd never seen Devin so chipper
>in hushed tones you talked freely
>you could tell he felt liberated
>you asked if he'd carried those feelings since he was a kid
>"you were amazing. still are. we were practically brothers so I'd always kind of worried…"
>you had that in common
>you'd worried about going too far
>you both had a lot to lose if you botched it
>you promised yourself you wouldn't
>so the shirtless guy on his phone?
>he squeaked
>then glanced at the wall
>Devin avoided eye contact 
>but broke within seconds
>"fine fine"
>he pouted 
>"you sort of gave me a… human thing"
>human thing?
>your raised eyebrow scrutinized him and he sort of slumped into his chair
>a bit of nervous whimpering
>then finally he broke under your bad cop interrogation 
>"fine. human guys are hot to me. happy?"
>he tried pouting 
>you were coming around to a guy being cute yourself
>even slouching in the worn chair he was about your height
>you gave him another kiss on the cheek as a sort of reward
>that seemed to placate his anxiety 
>soon enough the credits were rolling and you both realized you'd missed the entire movie
>that wasn't important though
>you offered to pay for a light dinner 
>"you paid for the theater food"
>it was no issue 
>"no no now I put my foot down."
>so sandwiches it was
>and he paid
>you took him back to your place and he accepted the offer to stay at your place
>it was dark out and he didn't have work
>this time you offered your bed
>you promised to be a gentleman and he promised to do the same
>it was weird to be the big spoon with a guy bigger than you
>you asked if he still believed this was a dream
>"still worried about that. hug me tighter just in case"
>Devin's worries didn't come to pass
>you woke up with the lean giraffe boy still cuddled up next to you
>it was just like when you were kids
>just with a new context to it 
>he was clumsily hogging most of the bed 
>he had a t shirt and his underwear on
>you tried to be a gentleman and not be grabby 
>his fur was soft to the touch though
>it made him very warm
>the orange color gave him a warm glow in the sunrise
>he stirred a little after you
>his tail lazily swatted against you for a moment before he realized where he was
>"oh my God"
>he flopped off the bed 
>maybe it hit him that it wasn't a dream
>he landed on his ample butt
>waking up with morning wood around him would feel awkward for a while now
>you wondered if he'd feel the same
>he rubbed the sleep our of his eyes and you helped him up
>he had work later and you had classes so you both set about to get cleaned up and fed
>he got a bare bones breakfast ready for you both while you took first dibs on the shower
>he was nice enough to do hashed potatoes and fried ham for you
>he wolfed down his own portion of potatoes while waiting for you to get finished in the bathroom
>today he had a day shift so he couldn't stick around too long
>before he rushed out the door you nabbed him by the shoulder and kissed his face
>just to show him he wasn't dreaming
>he got weak in the knees but managed to get to his car 
>you'd noticed a change in Devin after that night
>he'd become super affectionate in his texts
>slightly more flamboyant 
>just reserved for you
>you were seeing the real him now
>the next few days you didn't hang out
>just chatted over the phone
>both of you were tied to your responsibilities 
>occasionally his texts were flirty but you could tell he wasn't one for taking charge 
>you decided to do some research about yourself
>one night you asked for a big step
>you wanted to see if you were committed and asked for a nude
>you prefaced it was OK if he said no
>he kept typing 
>the "..." kept appearing and disappearing 
>you could have just looked up porn but you preferred to see Devin
>after all that's what you'd be seeing 
>he finally mustered up an answer after a minute or two
>"just give me a minute"
>Devin was in a panic
>in a way, a long distance reveal was a double edged sword
>he worried about rejection and it gave him some distance 
>but would you react genuinely through text?
>doubts weighed on his heart
>he didn't want to screw up
>granted you'd seen him naked before but that was ages ago
>it also didn't have the same context
>this was very different 
>what if you didn't like it
>he kept worrying
>but you did ask him
>you'd have to see him naked sometime
>hopefully
>Devin was at the pizza place today but in between deliveries
>he was pacing in the work bathroom
>brainstorming how to do this
>what was a proper picture?
>he'd never sent one or had one sent
>the urge to leave the text on read was there
>after all you said it was OK if he didn't want to 
>but he wanted to have you look at him
>he mulled over it for about ten minutes
>then made triple sure the door was locked 
>he was about to pull his pants down 
>quadruple checked the lock
>he was confident now
>yeah 
>he was going to do this
>he tried to think what he thought was sexy
>he'd just copy that
>that was the ticket
>you were alerted to a text a few minutes later
>Devin was standing in the mirror of a bathroom
>his hand pulling down the waistband of his pants and underwear 
>a semi erect six inches of dick flopped out of his pants
>his shirt was tugged up with his teeth
>exposing the fine orange fur of his stomach
>he tried looking flirty but it came off goofy to you
>like he was acting
>however you felt more confident with a guy now
>Devin looked easy on the eye
>you thanked him and asked if he wanted one in return
>it was only fair
>he stammered around for a few minutes again, his bashfulness pouring out from every text he sent in a flurry
>Devin hadn't anticipated a response like that
>he was panicking 
>he'd seen parts of you
>even sort of maybe pilfered a pair of your underwear 
>not that you'd said anything 
>he felt less weird about that now
>taking a few deep breaths he calmed himself
>perhaps he was curious
>plus it was only fair
>so in the name of fairness he agreed
>"you can send me one if you want"
>he tried not to sound too desperate 
>you complied
>you felt it best to mirror his picture
>so dick out and everything
>you felt you weren't anything to write home about but you weren't there for his reaction
>Devin had to go back to work with a raging erection
>Devin welcomed working outside in the cold 
>at least then maybe outside factors would keep his penis down
>so he was the first to volunteer to deliver that day
>his boss noticed he was a tad… twitchy
>he played it off as too much coffee
>which was a bold faced lie but the boss bought it 
>thankfully tucking his dick alongside his leg helped hide it
>just barely
>the giraffe boy was hung 
>it was a point of embarrassment for him
>thankfully the drive was just the distraction he needed
>you were busy with classes for a while but texted him occasionally 
>both of you appreciated the other's picture
>you could now say Devin was attractive 
>you'd definitely go for it if he wanted it
>at the moment you'd take it slow but you bet being a guy would mean Devin would love putting out
>that was a bridge you could cross later but seemed to be a big benefit to being with a guy
>you wanted to date before jumping into that
>something he agreed to
>you had to admit his nude was making that decision harder
>classes were dull
>your professors were not nearly as exciting as company
>Devin was your best friend beforehand
>maybe this was just the step in the next best direction
>it was going to be weird telling him you loved him and all that
>you could get used to it though
>just had to find the best way to genuinely say it 
>you decided to ask him to hang out at your place whenever he had the time
>you were already doing that before you touched his junk anyways
>"I would love to"
>Devin was thankful text couldn't convey his nervousness
>he just had to play it cool
>after all this was just like when you two were friends
>so it shouldn't be weird should it?

>the next time you were both free was around Sunday
>he asked if he could grab a shower at your place after a early shift at the hotel 
>no problem there
>when he came by and ensued himself to the bathroom you asked him if he wanted help
>mostly to see how he'd take to flirting 
>his reaction was to turn bright red best he could under the fur and stammer out some rapid fire sentence before rushing to the bathroom
>that was endearing
>well you had to at least attempt to shoot your shot
>his shower was quick and he had a new change of clothes
>a new skimpier change of clothes you noticed 
>he wasn't showing off that much orange midriff when you were just friends 
>or wearing shorts like that
>was this his way to flirt?
>he sat down next to you on the bed and relaxed against your shoulder
>you decided on a movie for that night
>he relaxed next to you
>his fur made him warmer to the touch
>you'd nabbed your pillows and put them against the wall so you both could recline and watch the tv
>with how rinky dink the apartment was it was either have the tv face the couch or tv and you liked sleeping with it on
>the chill from outside had you sharing a blanket
>you didn't keep the apartment like an icebox but you couldn't have the heat on full blast either
>you'd picked a few horror movies for the occasion and he agreed
>even though he was a scaredy cat when you two were younger
>"that was then. I'm fine now."
>ten minutes in he clung to your arm
>his slender arms snaked around your own
>it wasn't even that scary a movie
>you weren't going to complain though
>plus you bet he was fine with the cuddling under the blankets
>he squeaked at a really gory kill
>you laughed softly and he shot daggers at you
>"you did this on purpose"
>he pouted and your laugh grew
>you didn't but you can always get up and change the movie
>"noooo"
>he pulled you back to the pillow and you two continued your marathon 
>you awoke in the middle of the night
>age must be catching up with you or you were just that comfortable 
>he'd passed out cuddled up to you 
>his leg somehow ended up draped over you
>it was like it came naturally to him
>you let him rest
>the soft fur rubbing against your skin had become comfortable 
>you found yourself falling asleep again but before you did you kissed Devin softly on the forehead
>you awoke buried in the nape of Devin's neck
>he really was accustomed to being the little spoon
>the warmth was nice
>you tried not to press your morning wood against his ass
>his… pillowy thick ass
>well that wasn't helping your morning wood
>trying to scoot back only had Devin scooting back to meet you
>the ass was impossible to escape 
>eventually you were backed against the wall with Devin's back to you
>he mumbled as he woke up
>unconsciously he pressed against you harder and you silently begged for mercy
>you were wedged right into the middle of his ass
>he turned his head slightly to look at you
>"is that what I think it is?"
>well you had to be honest
>he processed this for a moment
>"I mean we're both guys."
>you wondered where this was going
>you could tell he was hesitating but you waited to see what he was thinking
>"I'm hard too"
>was this happening?
>he sort of awkwardly left the conversation hang there
>maybe he wanted you to take charge?
>you reached downwards and ran your fingers over his stomach
>he didn't panic or stop you
>instead he turned to face you
>"are you sure about this? about us?"
>you were 
>this was all new to you but it felt right
>"I was sort of holding onto this as my trump card but since you're fine with going further…"
>he gently grabbed one of your hands at the wrist and pulled it up to his face
>you were confused
>then he stuck the pointer in his mouth
>oh fuck
>it didn't stop there
>you felt something circle around your finger 
>coiling slowly like a snake
>his tongue could do that?
>then you were shocked when he pulled your finger and it's like his tongue kept coming out with it
>it seemed endless
>you weren't exactly an expert on anatomy but clearly giraffes were different 
>he did this all without breaking eye contact with you
>his eyes were pleading and sweet despite the debauched act in front of your face
>you couldn't see your finger now, the blue tongue just covered all of it
>you didn't need him to paint you more of picture 
>your dick was now straining to tear out of its prison and find a new home in the grip of this hot flexible muscle
>well you were into Devin and really really wanted to be IN Devin right now

>he slowly ended his demonstration and uncoiled the blue tongue from your digit
>you were definitely won over
>guys it was 
>Devin it was more like it
>holy shit
>his face carried his familiar chipper attitude after seeing yours
>"so you like it? I tried measuring my tongue once and it was about 21 inches"
>holy shit 
>the long neck and long face may have helped hide it
>"at least I think it's that long. it's a giraffe thing apparently"
>good lord your imagination was swimming, which must have been the intent 
>"don't get me wrong. I love the idea of being your boyfriend and I don't want to sound greedy."
>there was that doubt snaking into his eyes
>his confidence seemed to wane as the seconds passed
>screw it
>dick was going to do the talking for you now and you hoped it was the best call
>you asked if he ever gave a blowjob
>"well no. I always wanted to but…"
>he fumbled and you saw the timid Devin return
>"I was kind of hoping… you know. with you?"
>dick assumed full control
>you asserted yourself a little and grabbed ahold of one of his horns
>they were just big enough to wrap you hand around
>he went wide eyed 
>this was happening
>you gently scooted him off the bed and guided him onto his knees 
>you sat up and glanced down
>you could see the shy Devin ebb away when he was inches from your crotch 
>"really?"
>he looked like he could scarcely believe he was here now
>then he saw your manhood twitch and he gasped 
>his hands gently rested on your knees and he moved closer
>Devin was right
>why not enjoy every aspect of this relationship together?
>the romance, the friendship and the lust
>you saw his dick, making the little underwear he wore useless
>he was leaking precum like a faucet out of the strange tip
>so at least you were sure you weren't the only one that wanted this
>but you still felt the need to make sure
>you asked if he wanted to keep going, no pressure if he said no
>you'd respect it even with blue balls
>his reply was to slowly snake his blue tongue past your waistband while looking you right in the eye
>his tongue was strong and flexible enough to curl and then pull your underwear back
>it was strange to watch
>Devin was definitely different than a human but it wasn't bad
>in fact you liked it more
>he had this exotic quality and it added to the taboo of you both being guys
>deep down though, this was your Devin
>the same guy you played tag with in the woods
>and now he was tenderly tugging you dick free from its imprisonment 
>this was meant to be
>it felt right
>once your cock and balls were free he looked in awe at it
>it was very different than his
>you couldn't lie and say you were bigger than him
>but he didn't seem to care about that
>you relaxed at seeing him awestruck
>"I'd seen human dicks over the internet," he softly breathed against your dick
>"but this is yours. wow."
>he nuzzled up to it and that sent a jolt through you
>you were glad he seemed impressed
>this was the first blowjob you'd ever gotten
>and it sounded like he was just as new to this
>hopefully it was as fun as it looked on the internet
>when his tongue poked out and slowly snaked up your shaft it was already better than it looked
>his blue tongue climbed further and further still, gripping your cock as deftly as fingers
>this was fucking unreal
>your fingers gripped his horns as he kept going
>being enveloped in hot tight muscle
>was he just built for this?
>you groaned and he stopped to look up
>you were fine and you pushed him to keep going
>soon enough base to tip had vanished in the coils of your boyfriends tongue
>he flicked hair out from in front of his eyes and then took you for a ride
>the prehensile part came into play and your entire dick was being milked all at once 
>you thrust your hips up greedily
>his hands occupied themselves playing with himself 
>he was frantically stroking his flared cock while he jerked you off with his tongue
>his trump card was a complete success
>you didn't even want to jerk off any more
>you wanted to use him instead
>you could tell he took extra care to tease the tip, his tongue capable of that much independence 
>it was insane and nothing could replicate it 
>he had you at his mercy 
>and you loved it
>the look in his eyes was that same joyous glitter you'd expected from Devin but there was a sultry look to them too
>if this was him seducing you consider yourself seduced
>he came violently against your bed and himself, the girly moans close enough to your leg it could be felt
>his shaft poured ropes out everywhere like a hose
>you could feel him tire briefly from the afterglow but he wasn't leaving you hanging
>he moved forward and his tongue and your cock vanished into his mouth
>he braced his hands against your legs and looked up like a pet pleading for treats
>you couldn't help yourself 
>you needed this man
>all the doubts were gone and you used his horns to fuck his sweet face
>he didn't even gag, just kept milking until finally you tilted your head back and erupted down his throat 
>you bellowed his name as it came flooding out
>you'd used your hand plenty but this was fucking life changing
>with the most satisfied sigh you'd ever made, you released your grip and he pulled back slowly
>"so," his shyness returning "was I good? I hope I was"
>his eyes looked to yours for validation and what else could you say but that was amazing
>he lit up and embraced your torso, nuzzling your stomach with his head
>you hefted him onto your lap
>it was a little difficult 
>with how tall and bottom heavy he was 
>but you didn't like the idea of him stuck on the floor
>he hugged you after the initial surprise
>"so I guess it's official, right?"
>you were already almost like brothers
>now you two just deepened it further
>definitely not like brothers now
>but yes
>this was very much official 
>you were both a mess and you suggested once more a shower together
>you know 
>to save water
>this time he was happy to agree
>his positivity had fully crept back into his voice
>"I promise you won't regret it"
>he squeezed you like a stuffed animal and nuzzled you
>his fur was noticeably sticky against your stomach but warm nonetheless 
>you definitely didn't regret it
>"I'm happy you came back"
>he sighed and held you there
>Devin was a bit like a housecat now
>in that he was so perfectly comfortable sitting on you you didn't want to ruin the moment 
>your hand felt like it had sunk into the flesh of his thick ass
>something he didn't protest
>you weren't very confident in carrying him to the bathroom but to hell with doubts
>you'd gotten your first blowjob and discovered for sure you were into guys all in one go this morning 
>why not try and actually sweep Devin off his feet
>you were new to the gay couple thing but figured he'd be impressed by you picking him up
>"wait, what are-"
>his sentence was cut short by his squeak as you lifted you don't know how many pounds of giraffe boy into the air while rising
>you weren't like out of shape but this almost felt like an undertaking
>still, no way were you losing face now
>full steam ahead
>you tried to hide a rushed pace but were halted at the bathroom door
>you needed to gingerly turn sideways so as to not immediately bonk Devin against the door frame
>the sudden activity would no doubt have your back screaming later but you had definitely impressed the other boy
>his eyes told you plenty
>right now you were probably looking like some conquering brute and he seemed to have a thing for that
>you gently set him down on his feet in the shower
>he tried to hide his growing erection and the girlish excitement by fiddling with the water 
>after having the life nearly sucked out of you you needed a second but you felt arousal growing as well
>had he always looked this good?
>or was the friendship holding you back just a little?
>until that theater incident you'd only seen him as a friend
>you hadn't considered him as something more
>here you were, both naked
>it was a bit different than when you played doctor
>you realized you were staring and he'd noticed
>his eyes glanced briefly at your own dick
>you weren't hiding yours
>you snapped back and realized 
>you'd dropped your underwear on autopilot at some point
>however you resisted the urge to push your boyfriend against the shower wall and go wild
>you wanted him to be your boyfriend 
>and rushing headlong through it all might be too much
>so you took a deep breath and hopped into the shower
>the thought occurred of lifting him and screwing him into the wall
>wait
>supposed to think unsexy thoughts or something
>this was still your Devin and not some whore
>you were going to do this right
>he deserved better than that
>however you were mentally making a note you were going to take up lifting to fulfill that very daydream
>you bet Devin would appreciate that too
>this shower called for a different approach 
>you spun him around and just embraced him
>he was initially surprised but quickly melted into your hug
>you murmured up to him
>you were happy you came back to this town and to him too
>maybe this had been destined to be
>ever since that confession in the woods maybe this was what was set out for you two
>you ran your hands over his lower back as you both felt the warmth was away all the grime 
>you loved him and you whispered that right up to his ear
>he almost sounded like he sniffled at that
>"I love you too"
>he squeezed you tightly 
>his voice was a little choked up but he pulled himself together just as quickly
>after a few minutes he was the one to break the hug and turned to bend over and grab soap
>you had to maintain all your control at that moment
>his ass was nicer than a lot of girls' you'd seen
>his tail swished back and forth 
>this was perhaps innocent to him
>your erection was trying to get you in trouble right now
>he turned back and offered the bar to you
>"you want to get my back for me please?"
>must maintain 
>self 
>control 
>you audibly gulped and silently hoped for your erection to go down
>was this Devin teasing him?
>it was working
>good God was it working
>nope nope
>you were going to go about this all civilized
>then he cooed at you rubbing his back
>attempting civilized 
>it did give you a better chance to see Devin in a new light
>you'd never really considered his curves
>or the tight muscles in his back
>he wasn't ripped by any means but he wasn't completely soft
>aside from that ass
>that was pretty much a pillow
>his fur felt slick under the water
>it was actually sort of relaxing to wash him
>he sort of shivered when your hands started washing along his shoulders
>he tried to hide it but you caught it
>you carried on with business as usual
>for a guy he was actually pretty and being hands on like this allowed you to appreciate it
>eventually you finished up, despite taking your sweet time
>he turned around and offered to get your back
>you hoped to stay somewhat in control but damn did he make that difficult

>you didn't know how much of this was Devin just being nice or him flirting
>possibly both
>he was still the same timid guy to you and you doubted he'd go that much out of his comfort zone
>your racing mind was wrong about him flirting
>instead he contented himself to wash your back as gingerly as possible
>if anything that intimate touch from him was almost as good as anything sexual
>he ran his hands over you smoothly
>"I was always fascinated by how bare human guys could be," he murmured 
>"not that you don't have hair but it's just so different from me. it's cute."
>so he liked how unlike you looked
>you had to agree with the sentiment 
>you don't think you'd be I human guys
>maybe that was shallow
>though Devin being Devin was the foot in the door for you
>he was still your best friend
>just more than that
>so he looked extra attractive to you
>and you weren't ashamed to admit it
>you complimented him back, saying he was honestly the prettiest guy you'd ever seen
>"pretty? w-well I don't know about that. but thank you"
>you meant it
>you admitted he'd single handedly changed your mind on men
>and he was the best looking
>that made him stammer for a second 
>"me? I did that?"
>he'd stopped washing your back for a minute, probably deep in thought
>you were glad you did what you did in that theater 
>"well I'm glad you did too"
>he hugged you from behind and rested his head on yours
>that gesture from him was always cute
>after the shower you toweled off and both got cleaned up 
>the usual morning traditions
>for breakfast you both went out to a local diner
>this time Devin wasn't going to be happy until you at least went Dutch, which you finally conceded to
>you brought up the idea of another movie this weekend
>at another empty showing
>he read between the lines and got bashful but agreed 
>"I enjoyed the last… movie"
>you agreed 
>the rest of the meal was relaxed otherwise
>he was chipper when going over the last work week 
>he'd finally heard back from his boss at the security job and he was cool with you coming in for an interview 
>Devin would train you for a few nights but it was a pretty straightforward gig
>when the check arrived your hands bumped and he got all flustered
>same old Devin
>the rest of your day felt… lighter somehow
>perhaps Devin was the missing puzzle piece that brought it all together
>he was certainly a ray of sunshine when it came to it
>always doting on you
>was he openly gay out in town?
>it didn't seem like it 
>you figured it out but you were close
>you were driving the two of you back to your place and you felt like it was right to talk a little 
>you asked if he would like to meet your parents
>maybe it was a little sudden but he did make it feel like the right call
>he was initially shocked
>"they're OK with you being well…"
>he was the first person you'd have brought home 
>your parents were pretty chill though
>he was floored when you said he'd be welcome with you no matter what
>you meant it
>you didn't want to screw this up and you really wanted to make this work
>so you wanted to show you were serious
>it didn't have to be tomorrow or anything but you left the offer on the table
>he was touched 
>I'd… be honored."
>you squeezed his hand as you got to your apartment
>you spent the rest of the morning playing video games before you both had to head to your work and school
>the coming weekend and job training would at least be interesting 
>Devin came over every night or day 
>whenever he was free
>he was welcome
>some might say this was going too fast but you two had already gotten into the know each other phase when you were in elementary school
>so it just made sense 
>he was your friend 
>so you already knew him plenty
>it was meshing together as boyfriend that was new
>but all that meant was being more touchy feely 
>you weren't like fucking yet
>just the occasional fooling around
>your bed was his
>curiosity got the better of you and you asked about his place
>he got quiet for a moment
>"you… uh wouldn't want to see it. I feel sort of bad imposing."
>he wasn't though
>you said as much he was always welcome
>your hand on his waist had him ease up and lean back against you
>the tender little touch had that warm joy return to his face
>that reaction was a little confusing
>you just sort of cuddled back on the bed and had dinner while watching TV
>the internet out here was kind of crap so you still used DVDs and what not
>he seemed content watching the same stuff
>dinner was Chinese take out
>he paid this time
>the only stipulation was the lo mein was veggies
>which wasn't the worst
>he grabbed you dumplings to compensate 
>it was a good dinner
>after a long shift he fell asleep against you before even finishing his meal
>you let him rest
>the giraffe boy mumbled sweetly in his sleep
>he snuggled up closer to you and you gently took his plate from him 
>it was hard to rest sitting up but you did it anyways
>he was soft against your skin
>he pushed himself too much
>you could see that much
>you had no room to judge but you felt he did too much
>you knew he has good reason but it didn't make it right 
>you were both young do maybe you both could fix that
>he didn't spell it out but you could see he stressed to get everything together
>he carried a lot of weight on his shoulders and didn't want to bring attention to it
>you'd be there for him
>eventually you two awoke
>he'd eventually knocked up both over on the bed
>how he slept like that you don't know
>it must hurt to sleep like that
>he groaned as he woke up 
>sleepyhead 
>it was cute
>breakfast, cleanup and chill 
>it had become a welcome routine with Devin
>he was attempting to do more kitchen wise
>you noticed he would bring groceries over for meals for the both of you more often
>you kept offering to pay and he kept turning it down
>but he was supporting your parents would be your protest
>"never mind that," was his reply
>he wasn't letting you pay for food he was cooking, he reasoned
>what if he screwed it up? 
>then you'd be out money
>he didn't screw up though
>his cooking started off rough
>not that you were one to talk
>but all he'd really make is pizzas for the most part
>you both still talked about the same stuff as always 
>in a lot of ways nothing changed between you two
>you didn't feel pressured to do things too differently because he seemed to approach it the same way too
>maybe this was what the gay thing was?
>you didn't exactly have the experience and neither did he
>the little romantic gestures just felt right when you two did them
>such as him serving you breakfast 
>he didn't do well with meat but still made you ham and eggs regardless
>you didn't know how he ate vegetables for everything 
>you guess maybe it was part of biology 
>still pretty nice of him to make you special meals
>the eggs were better than his last attempt 
>the morning was peaceful
>you decided the theater wouldn't be it
>you offered to take him to the park and he was flattered
>perhaps you could spin it into a picnic
>well rain check on that
>but still, nice thought and it seemed to flatter him
>so park it was
>it was a tiny lot of land but still pretty
>thankfully your apartment was close enough it was within walking distance
>a walk with Devin allowed you both to relax
>you both weren't sure about PDA in town
>you'd practically groped each other in a dark theater but that was different
>this was out in the open
>that part was difficult 
>but you at least still act like "good friends" out in the open
>quietly chatting gave you a little insight with Devin
>he wasn't out in town
>unsure how people would react
>because honestly until you came back he felt alone
>sure there was the internet but that wasn't exactly healthy
>Devin was just content to be himself in private 
>you asked him about if his family knew and he piped up before attempting to change the subject 
>you didn't make an attempt to force the discussion
>he'd tell you in time
>so you played with the change in subject
>he asked about classes
>you didn't want to bore him but he was enthralled all the same
>maybe it was a grass was greener attitude 
>most of it was online crap so ho hum there
>but he still hung on your words and occasionally looked to you to for eye contact
>this early in the morning the park was pretty dead
>so it just seemed to be you two and you picked a spot near a fountain in the center to lounge 
>the weather was nice and he was dressed pretty as could be
>he had a worn denim jacket he'd kept for years
>a shirt that clung to his chest and pants almost as tight
>being open with him was looking pretty good 
>the place was so small you could see the borders of the place around you so no surprises 
>you looked around and when the coast was clear you pulled his head close and kissed him on the cheek
>he stammered and tried to suppress his blush 
>in time he'd openly be your boyfriend and he'd love it
>for now a little gesture like this was enough
>he tried to look at his feet and flicked some of his hair away from his face
>trying to look casual in the moment 
>meanwhile his mind was rushing a million miles a minute
>then you had him almost yelp when you held his hand
>you couldn't do a whole lot in the open right now
>but this felt right
>and it seemed to bring him around to the genuine Devin you'd seen behind closed doors
>he was lovestruck and somehow you caused it

>the birdsong overhead was thankfully your only company
>the sunshine and unseasonably warm weather made for a good day
>so you enjoyed the quiet little moments
>Devin was good company
>even if it was just sitting on a park bench
>eventually your conversation picked back up and he got comfortable being that affectionate out here
>video games, shows, the like
>"what movie would you like to see for our…?"
>when you finished his sentence with "date" the flustered Devin returned 
>he however agreed after collecting himself
>you would wing whatever movie was there
>you were sure they had something
>plus your attention probably wouldn't be on the movie
>just a guess
>so you weren't committed to a specific movie as long as Devin was there 
>his palm felt smooth against yours
>he was still a skittish about being out in public but with you he seemed to relax 
>"I didn't think I could get this far."
>he looked down to his feet and you caught the faintest smile 
>you smiled back
>you were glad he got this far
>you hoped to go farther 
>after a while you decided to head back home
>today wasn't super busy but you didn't want to get caught off guard and have to rush
>plus you had time for a surprise 
>he was floored when you gave him a spare key to your place
>it wasn't like he wasn't welcome before but now you wanted him to be able to come and go whenever he pleased 
>he pulled you into a hug and it would have taken a crowbar to pry him off
>after feeling like a small stuffed animal he finally set you down
>he smelled nice
>did he use perfume today?
>it had a sort of light cherry scent
>you wanted to remark but instead just hugged him tightly back and let the smell of him stick to you
>"you won't regret this," he sighed 
>the hug was about the nicest feeling you'd had in ages
>it was a pain to break that embrace 
>but you needed to both head out
>he was as reluctant as you but kissed you on the cheek as a parting gift
>made classes tolerable
>occasionally he texted you and you him
>made things pleasant 
>whereas before you talked about mundane stuff like tv shows or video games there was more romantic and even carnal texts
>he was so happy you accepted him
>you were happy to have someone in your life
>he made you smile and from the way he spoke he shared that sentiment 
>you had a boyfriend 
>never would have thought life would be like this when you moved back
>but you were glad you did
>he was off work a bit later than your classes but asked if it was OK to come over
>"I don't want to be a bother."
>he could never be such a thing
>you replied you gave him that key for a reason
>that brought forth a series of thank yous
>after classes you headed straight home and got some leftovers
>you lost track of studies and before you knew it Devin had let himself in
>he hopped in the shower real quick and didn't bother wearing anything but panties when he came out
>you wondered if that was intentional
>it made studying a little more difficult as you tried not to glance over
>he wrapped a slender arm over your shoulder and then turned on the tv 
>this was him comfortable
>you were thankful for baggy sweatpants
>though he might appreciate the "appreciation"

>he had made himself super comfortable around you
>this was essentially just what you two did beforehand just with alterations 
>it was a miracle he didn't make you erect this much back then
>maybe because you still saw him as just a friend
>he didn't seem to have held that reservation 
>so you decided to tease him a little while you studied
>you'd had a hunch on something for a while
>after all he was the only one that had visited
>he sipped slowly on a glass of water and that's when you decided to strike
>so you disarmed him with a soft smile
>not like this was bad
>you asked if he liked the boxers he took from your dresser
>that had his eyes shoot wide open and he nearly choked on water
>you set down your books and laptop and laughed softly
>your hands groped for his legs and you heaved him up onto your lap
>he tried to look everywhere in the room but directly into your eyes
>your hand rested on his thigh and he instantly lost any cool
>well you hoped he liked them 
>you kissed him on the cheek and he still averted his gaze so you tilted his face towards yours for a gentle kiss
>he melted then and there
>his arms wrapped behind your neck as he tried to recollect his thoughts
>you told him he was adorable and you didn't think he would ever speak coherently ever again
>his body was super warm to the touch
>his bare fur was soft to the touch
>you called him cute
>"nooo"
>>still trying not to look at you
>it was cute
>he leaned into you all the same
>"so… maybe I took your…"
>underwear?
>he pouted
>well you understood why at least although you didn't see the appeal of your boxers
>he mumbled in response
>you raised an eyebrow at that and he couldn't sneak out of it
>"fine," he replied with a soft whine
>"I kind of sort of maybe jerked off with them."
>well you guessed as much
>his dick seemed to be straining now under your interrogation 
>those panties hid nothing
>so
>your hand reached for his dick
>he stroked himself like that
>after all the studying and classes it would be good to burn off some stress
>he gasped but practically surrendered to your touch
>you were feeling a lot more confident with a guy
>more than you used to 
>his blow job and showing off for you made it official 
>Devin made you hard
>and judging by the meat in your hand he did the same
>he felt your dick digging into his soft ass and showed some initiative
>his hand snaked into your pants and fished it out
>"you're hot to me. always have been."
>it just took you longer but you agreed he attracted you
>"so yeah, I liked your boxers"
>you shifted him so he straddled you
>both of you frotted your cocks together
>it was different than just jerking off
>way way way better
>the way he moaned your name was cute
>you wanted him and he wanted you
>his kiss started off cute then hungry
>his tongue easily out wrestled yours and it felt like he wouldn't stop
>it was like deepthroating him while your hips worked in concert rubbing your dicks together
>your hands naturally squished his ass as you both let lust overtake any reasoning
>he finally reeled his tongue back in to allow you to breath
>he nestled next to your head and moaned a soft little song of "I love you"
>he was soft in your grip
>neither of you had gone this far with a guy 
>both of you just ran off instinct now
>he was cute when he was in the throes of passion
>you both bucked your hips against the other
>his ass just felt so good to squeeze
>he moaned when you did it
>his tongue was a constant invader 
>you'd have to get used to every kiss being a messy one that robs your breath
>neither of you touched yours dicks, content to get each other off like this
>more than once his tongue snaked too fair in his eagerness 
>you'd cough but were back to it in seconds
>he'd be worried briefly then he was back to tasting the inside of your mouth
>your cocks throbbed and you knew you were close
>he threw his head back as he broke another hungry kiss
>your stomach was a mess as he shot his seed
>he didn't stop grinding up against you though
>within seconds it was enough to push you over the edge with him
>it was fucking amazing and in the afterglow he slumped against you
>you could hear the smile in his voice as he cuddled up to you
>you both passed out with him blanketing you on the couch
>the next morning you were rudely awoken by his alarm
>he fell backwards off the couch and all the weight was off your lap in an instant
>you were half awake and saw him scrambling for his phone on the charger near the couch
>he shut it off and the noise instantly vanished
>"sorry" 
>you feebly got up and helped him to his feet
>it was alright
>looked dark outside though
>you asked what time it was 
>"4 AM. really sorry."
>you stretched and remarked that it was no big deal
>you didn't have classes today so it wasn't an issue
>he had a shift in a bit for the hotel so you suggested a shower and taking him for breakfast nearby beforehand
>you were both a mess from last night
>"you have a point and I could eat. but I'm fine with oatmeal or something."
>well at least he was easy to please
>you did happen to have oatmeal so that was fine
>coffee too
>you put the pot on before you both stepped into the shower
>the temptation to make it more was there but you didn't want to make Devin late
>that didn't stop you from kissing the back of his neck to see him lock up for a second
>caught him in mid sentence and everything
>but you didn't push it farther 
>"that's not fair you know," he remarked with a laugh
>"made me lose my train of thought"
>he was talking about the security job, you reminded him
>"oh right"
>you suggested you come by tonight to do some of that training 
>he saw the wisdom in that
>after getting cleaned and toweled off breakfast was good
>even if it was just cinnamon oatmeal and coffee
>he kissed you before he headed out and you caught up on some more sleep
>your trip over to the warehouse later was fairly quick
>small town traffic was absolutely amazing for that
>he'd been there for a little bit before dark and you pulled up a little later into his shift
>this wasn't official training or anything but it was also an excuse to hang out
>you brought a late dinner for you both
>it was leftovers but he was appreciative nonetheless 
>he pulled you into another tight hug before he reminded himself to be semi professional at the moment 
>he cleared his throat and relaxed 
>"thank you"
>you smiled 
>he got flustered again
>that reaction got a laugh from you
>he pouted in retaliation 
>he was adorable 
>despite his insistence he wasn't right now
>"I'm supposed to be working…"
>you relented because you weren't going to spoil his job for him
>so you let him recover and changed the subject to what this entailed
>it was about as challenging as he described earlier
>he really got you a relatively stress free job
>so you went over the procedures 
>you wanted to let him regain a little bit of his self esteem about his work so you let him talk
>it was actually cute to see him like this
>it probably took a lot for him to be as collected as he was right now
>he was in full boss mode
>a rare glimpse at a new side of him
>he wasn't full drill instructor but there was a serious responsibility behind his training
>he wanted you to learn and you wanted to uphold the trust he put in you
>when it came time for the rounds he was taking you with him
>there were no cameras because the higher ups figured a guard was enough deterrent
>so at least things weren't complicated
>no one ever broke in so this really was the easiest work
>he grabbed his flashlight and waved you to follow him out of the booth

>walking around in the dark with Devin was almost funny
>he was a little bit of a scaredy cat from previous experience and it seemed that trait was still there
>he peeked around corners
>like something would jump him
>despite him repeating multiple times before that nothing ever really happened here
>he didn't see the grin growing on your face
>you picked up a pebble without him noticing
>following him around made it easy
>he was so preoccupied with the dark around the warehouses that he didn't notice 
>when you heaved the rock at a corrugated steel shack you didn't account for two key things

>1) he was in front of you
>2) he would move away from the noise

>you were knocked over by a giant orange blur that immediately fumbled and tripped over you
>you couldn't help but laugh though
>"not funny"
>you explained what you did 
>by your reaction he'd figured it out before that
>"I'm not helping you up for that"
>he wasn't actually angry or at least for long
>he was up and had his hands resting on his hips
>the pout was cute from down on the ground
>it was worth it though
>you weren't crying laughing but it was still funny as hell
>this job could be fun
>despite his earlier statement he helped you up
>he did however bop you in the arm for the trouble
>you were just keeping him on his toes
>"ass"
>then he laughed
>you suggested going and apprehending the offending pebble
>"I could just lock you out of the booth, you know?"
>but then the offer of energy drinks in you car perked him up
>"OK, I may relent."
>you offered to protect him from any any dangerous pebbles 
>"you're lucky you're cute."
>you made a note to show him another scary movie when he came over
>he couldn't a smile as you laughed
>you headed over to your car and grabbed the drinks
>you were digging through the backseat when hands grabbed you
>you had no time to react before you were pantsed 
>then Devin ran back to the booth giggling the whole way
>you pulled your pants back up and headed over to your future coworker
>the nonchalant whistling was a good touch
>you had an energy drink and he did end up thanking you
>you did point out pulling your pants down in public felt different now somehow 
>he nearly spat out the sip he just took and instead coughed
>you lightly smacked his back while he gathered his composure again
>you thought about joking about your coworker sexually harassing you
>but then he might not give you more blowjobs
>you would hold that one off for later
>the price was too great
>so instead you two just settled in for the rest of his shift
>the next time he went out for his rounds he eyed you suspiciously 
>"no funny stuff this time?"
>you swore to protect him from any strange pebbles leaping out in the night
>"see this is why I'm not apologizing for the trampling"
>you pulled him close by the waist and promised to stay by his side the whole time
>he melted at that but quickly recovered
>"just be forewarned if something jumps out I'm hopping in your arms like Scooby-Doo."
>oh no
>the horror
>full sprinting while carrying him sounded difficult though
>not that you said that part aloud
>or would he like you calling his ass big?
>you had no idea how gay compliments worked
>did they go around complimenting the size of each other's balls or something?
>thoughts for another day
>er, night
>you did point out that perhaps he should carry you
>"oh you want to be the girl now?"
>ok point taken 
>he was the girl now and forever
>without a repeat of the earlier incident the rounds were done in minutes
>all the while Devin eyed you over his shoulder
>clearly he suspected mischief but you'd gotten that out of your system
>for now
>you put him at ease asking about plans at the theater 
>that worked and you could see any anxiousness about the dark warehouses vanish
>you two agreed to a movie neither of you had seen before
>since the theater was one of those second run ones it had been out before but it was skipped over
>some sort of action thing
>Devin really was the sole reason you were going to the movies nowadays 
>you admitted as such 
>"same for me. you're more fun to watch though."
>so it was almost promised you were getting lucky in that theater again if the planets aligned 
>the trip to the theater was delayed
>Devin was coming off work and said he wanted to freshen up
>that's where the trouble began
>seeing him undress so openly around you was amazing 
>he realized you were staring and then got bashful
>"am I that much to look at?"
>he was asking that while bent over and his bare ass was out
>he was either super oblivious or fishing for compliments
>God he was hot
>the primal urge to just shove it in was there
>you couldn't lie
>he saw the bulge in your jeans and took that as an answer
>"we… I should get ready… you know, for the…"
>his mind was drawing a blank as much as yours was
>you were way past the point about caring that he was a guy
>in fact it was doing the exact opposite for you
>crossing the room and grabbing him by his hips felt right
>"oh fuck!"
>he'd dropped his slacks from the hotel job in shock but he wasn't exactly against the idea
>his ass was so soft
>the fur was beautiful 
>your fingers sunk in as you gripped at it
>the movie could wait
>you reached around and sure enough his dick was as hard as yours
>a couple of pumps of the shaft made him whine
>your hand ventured up to his chest and you pulled him back up towards you
>he followed the dance pretty well
>you wanted to kiss him
>he agreed
>it was a messy hungry kiss
>Devin didn't seem to be capable of anything less
>his slender neck allowed him to easily turn and push back with a kiss
>your hand freed your own dick and he broke the kiss to gasp
>"I don't have lube on me"
>he looked apologetic 
>wait
>that was the one obstacle from getting his ass?
>well you didn't have any and you weren't that creative
>so you pulled back and slammed it between his thighs
>your head barely peaked out between his thighs
>you two would make do
>you weren't so horny you'd hurt Devin
>you double handed his twitching cock and just decided to let it out
>he moved to kiss you again, moaning your name before going in for it
>the movie could definitely wait

>Devin moaned into your mouth and kept thrusting his ass back towards you
>he wanted this as much as you
>fucking him for real could come later but right now ypu couldn't imagine anything better than his thighs
>he squeezed so tight around your dick
>his hands were keeping him  propped up against the wall 
>all while you sawed your manhood in and out of his thighs
>"I'm really sorry I don't have lube"
>he didn't need to apologize
>you loved him
>it wasn't just his ass
>you frantically matched the rhythm of your thrusts with your pumping
>you told him he made you feel good no matter what
>he groaned and arched his back as he came ropes against the wall
>"fuck I love you!"
>his ass and hips flexed as he got shaky knees
>before he collapsed on you or against the wall your hands grabbed at him
>with a palm on his stomach and another wrapped around and gripping the opposite shoulder, it was clumsy
>you made do and kept pounding away at his hips like an animal
>you growled into his ear how much you loved him as your seed joined his on the wall
>you grabbed his hand, both of you doozy after that improvised performance
>you kissed his knuckles as you both gathered your strength
>"I think… I will get lube. on the shopping list. definitely." 
>he giggled enough that you felt it through his back
>there was still time for the movie so you cleaned up the wall while he finished cleaning himself up 
>when he came out you noticed his pants hugged him a little tighter than his usual attire
>the drive to manhandle him again was creeping back into your mind
>he caught that instantly 
>his palm planted against your chest and he wagged a finger
>"down boy"
>he laughed and pulled you into a hug
>"that had looked cooler in my head. but let's have a little night on the town before you go all caveman."
>he blushed and tightened
>"I still can't believe I make you react that way. maybe this is a dream."
>you grinned underneath him and gave his ass a pinch through his pants
>he squeaked and instinctively shoved you back
>so, he had proof he finally wasn't dreaming
>he folded his arms and tried to pretend he hadn't just made that girly noise 
>you shrugged and gave your best innocent smile
>he tried to look stern and then immediately folded with a sigh
>"I'm going to have to watch you aren't I?"
>you couldn't help be a lovable scamp and asserted as much
>he disagreed
>the way his eyes narrowed said he had your number
>so off to the movies it was
>you drove and amazingly got there right on time
>just before the last trailer
>even had enough time for popcorn and a soda
>it felt like ages since you were here despite it only really being weeks
>despite his insistence he was fine and you didn't need to get him something he did sip your soda
>the place was empty 
>you hoped they actually did business
>believe it or not you two were on your best behavior
>Devin and you must have worked out all your sexual frustration before the movie
>at least for a bit
>no promises for later
>you both actually paid attention to the movie
>occasionally one of you would pop in for a joke or something
>Devin continued to steal sips from the totally not communal soda
>to think not to long ago an indirect kiss like that would have been strange to you
>now it was just part of life
>in the privacy of the theater you two could feel comfortable being more open 
>he leaned his head on your shoulder
>Devin was personally on cloud nine
>when he'd heard you were coming back he had hope in his heart
>to have it actually come true was like a fairy tale 
>just a bit raunchier compared to the classics
>not that Devin complained
>he was about ready to let you screw him just a hour or so before
>really needed to get lube for the occasion
>maybe something skimpier you may like
>not that Devin thought his figure looked good in much
>he hoped you noticed the new shampoo he got
>you had noticed he smelled nicer than usual
>the locks of his hair were softer than his fur if that was possible
>while you both had worked out your hormones earlier, you were both young guys
>it didn't get past some soft kissing and petting in the dark though
>making up for lost time with some horned up hijinks 
>both of you could not be happier 
>it was hard not to walk out of the theater arm in arm
>however, Devin had concocted something devilish from what he thought of earlier
>"so I had an idea…"
>he dangled the sentence out there, hoping you'd take the bait
>how could you not?
>"we get a nicer room at my hotel for a night. plan things out a little." 
>you raised your eyebrow at the proposition 
>"if… you want."
>well you did want
>certainly had to be an improvement over your little apartment for what you thought was planned
>so you headed to the car and talked about a date
>something that would work for both of you
>you offered him your place for the night
>tomorrow he'd be at the warehouse and you'd join him after classes
>for tonight you both curled up on the couch nearly naked
>that hotel date would be something to mark on the calendar 
>you were growing accustomed to Devin squeezed up to you
>in the middle of July it might be an issue but for now it felt good to have that warmth
>he was chest to chest with you
>how he slept with such an awkward neck was a mystery 
>you just sat there in the morning sun feeling him against you
>his breath soft as his chest rose and fell against yours
>it was like he needed to be in your arms, no matter how you two fit together
>it felt right
>you didn't wake him, instead preferring him to wake up naturally
>when he did that's when you pulled him into a tighter hug and he reciprocated 
>his voice near your ear was pleasing 
>when you two finally broke the embrace you both got up and stretched
>sleeping on the couch wasn't the greatest thing to make a regular event but you both recovered from it quickly
>you tried not to watch the way his muscles and curves worked as he bent this way and that
>he really was a work of art
>you kicked yourself for not seeing it sooner
>going about your day you felt a little more relaxed
>his texts help between classes helped
>at one point you got an unsolicited candid picture of his bare stomach from him
>pizza place must be fairly boring today
>your gain at least
>you didn't have opportunities to strip like him but you appreciated it
>his orange soft fur was a welcome sight
>you remembered how warm he was to the touch and it was amazing
>you had a wild guess for what he wanted that hotel room for and you were all for it
>that night at the warehouse was as uneventful as usual
>training had been easy and quickly forgotten in lieu of just goofing off
>despite Devin maintaining a professional front, he couldn't help but relax around you
>it wasn't long before you two were sitting on the floor 
>you were leaning back against him with him peaking over your shoulder
>being the bigger spoon to Devin was fine in bed but not when watching TV or something
>this was the best postion for that
>you knew how a stuffed animal felt
>his arms wrapped around you as you both watched stupid internet stuff on your phone
>occasionally he'd hug a little tighter 
>when he had to do his rounds it was an excuse to stretch your legs
>you swore you had better not spook him
>he demanded that you not toss any pebbles in the dark
>his glare on you was more humorous than anything but you reassured him
>"I'm watching you"
>it wasn't a serious threat
>the urge to try it again was there but there was a line between teasing and being an asshole and you didn't want to push it
>so away you two went through the routine
>sure enough, no burglars 
>you asked what the warehouse had that was this important
>"I was told electronics. makes sense to be cautious with that right?"
>he had a point
>he plopped back down on the floor and slapped his thigh to signal you 
>you didn't have to think twice and laid back against him, his arms pulling you into a comfortable embrace
>both of you talked and he nonchalantly brought up that hotel date idea 
>"you're really fine with that idea?"
>you looked forward to it but you didn't want to make him feel pressured
>"it's what I dreamed of."
>his arms squeezed tighter to emphasize 
>"let's mark it on a calendar now. make it official."
>so you went through you phone schedule and both of you planned far ahead 
>his slender finger poked a specific date
>"I'm completely free that day"
>it was a little ways away but that seemed to be the best chance
>you wondered just what he had planned
>hopefully he didn't go overboard trying to please you
>though maybe that was your chance to make things memorable for him too
>a chance to step up your game as it was
>little did you know he was thinking the same
>he reached over you to try and grab his coffee
>it was just out of reach and you grabbed it to hand off to him
>he took a sip and then you took a sip from it after he handed it back
>"that was because of the soda isn't it?"
>you laughed
>he pulled you closer and you two finished out his shift in relative peace and quiet

>the next few weeks seemed to fly by
>Devin stayed at your place pretty much any night he wasn't busy
>he was more than welcome
>the video game nights or movie marathons would turn into a sloppy blowjob sometimes
>he liked it and every session felt better than the last
>neither of you would plan it, just bam his head would end up in your lap half way through some movie
>he did the cutest thing flicking his hair away from his eyes while looking up to yours for approval 
>you weren't quite at the dick sucking stage of questioning your preferences but he didn't seem to mind handjobs
>the way he bucked and whined sometimes told you he liked your touch
>his body was growing familiar to you
>you loved tracing your fingertips over his smooth fur
>the orange was warm on your eyes
>his face was constantly joyful
>even when your dick was poking into his cheek
>he was skilled at cock sucking and he was very right to claim that was his trump card to win you over
>there was something hot about just toying with his own dick though
>it's meatiness didn't match up with his girly noises he made as you stroked him 
>one night you tried something you'd seen before in porn and rubbed right below his balls 
>a few seconds of that and he practically shot his hips upwards with a scream and shot load after load up like a geyser 
>that trick was filed away as your own secret trump card
>you were completely comfortable with Devin now
>you could say that
>every night you'd cuddle or do some regular hang out thing
>calling it friends with benefits would be too callous 
>that ignored your growing romantic feelings
>Devin was clearly always sweet on you but you had warmed up to him
>it felt good to have someone that wanted to make sure you got home safe
>like a real mature relationship
>you'd never had something like this and it was very new
>let alone with someone you already felt at ease with
>one night a wrench got thrown into the works
>it was while watching TV on the couch together
>you'd asked how his parents were
>didn't mean anything by it
>he finally came clean
>said you deserved the truth
>truth was the extra jobs weren't because of his family
>he came out to his family a year or so back
>they didn't… take it well
>"I've been working to keep a place of my own when I could do it."
>all of a sudden a lot added up
>he was always skittish about letting you ride in his car
>he practically cried when you let him have a key
>you asked if he was living out of his car and he tried not to look you in the eye
>his attempt not to give away the truth did it for him
>welp 
>you informed him you had a sixth month lease
>you'd be honored to sign a new one with him
>until then he was your guest whenever he felt comfortable 
>he started sniffling 
>maybe after his parents did what they did he couldn't expect good from someone
>you pulled him into an embrace
>you told him since he was living with you he should had least give up one job so he isn't pushing himself
>"I'll consider it"
>you whispered into his ear how you'd give him a full time job if he quit one
>with tips involved
>he just started laughing and softly elbowed your ribs as he melted into the hug
>after that revelation it was hard not to let him get closer
>he felt more relaxed
>no doubt that was a heavy weight off his shoulders
>you had wished he wasn't such a workaholic before this
>now you would insist he take it easier
>making him a househusband might even be in the cards
>you had high hopes but tried to be realistic 
>you were worried about botching this up
>after all, a friendship was one thing, this was another level
>just sort of running into a minefield blind
>so you hoped you'd get to the other wise unscathed 
>not that you thought Devin was a red flag
>you just knew how much was at risk here
>you'd heard horror stories of high school sweethearts turned into vipers
>divorce rates and all that jazz
>maybe you were too young to worry about that but you couldn't help seeing it done wrong multiple times
>so you handled Devin the best you could and he did the same for you
>ultimately it just came down to you two doing what came naturally
>after hearing about his situation you refused to let him sleep in his car again
>how he even did that was a mystery to you
>must have stuffed himself in like a clown car
>you'd definitely resign the lease with him on it
>working three jobs at least showed he was serious and responsible
>slowly of the next weeks it became his place unofficially as much as it was yours on paper
>he always worried about mooching off you but he paid you cash
>he insisted on groceries and what not
>as well as part of the utilities 
>if he thought he was mooching he was mistaken
>it was part of the reason he didn't initially tell you
>he didn't want you to pity him
>he didn't want to feel like he was taking advantage of your generosity 
>he wanted it all to be square and equal
>his drive to be a partner and not just be passive was endearing
>speaking of, the day of your hotel rendezvous was fast approaching
>as in a couple days 
>you asked him what he intended and he refused to answer
>"you'll just have to be there."
>there wasn't a whole lot of mystery what the surprise was but hearing it would have confirmed your suspicions 
>so you let him be on it
>he decided before the event he was going to put in his two weeks at the hotel
>well after your meeting there
>he said something about wanting to clean up the mess himself or he'd feel guilty
>that was sweet of him
>the night of the hotel date you couldn't lie and say you weren't nervous
>you decided to not come empty handed
>flowers and chocolate were cliche but you figured he'd appreciate it nonetheless 
>he texted the room number
>the door would be unlocked
>"hope to see you there"
>you wouldn't miss it
>you wouldn't miss it for the world
>you were getting laid tonight 
>you'd cleaned up and drove straight over
>his room was unlocked and darkness greeted you
>"shut the door then come here"
>there was a sultry side to his voice 
>you'd heard it before when he'd suck you off
>the voice alone had you at half mast
>"get the lamp"
> you did as he asked and your jaw nearly dropped
>his orange fur contrasted with the bright pink teddy
>his legs were on display with one folded over the other
>his dick was fully hard and leaking, clearly he'd been sitting there aroused a while
>he'd done up his eyelashes and his had the faintest hint of shadow on his lids
>lipstick wasn't a go for his face but it was clear he tried to gussy up
>the teddy didn't cover much of his chest, the "cleavage" was right there for you to see
>his tail slowly raised up and down next to him, beckoning you
>he reclined against the pillow and headboard
>"so, did I do good?"
>his look was soft, pleading
>he did perfect
>you were glad he got the courage up to do this
>now you were as hard as him
>you offered him the flowers and chocolate and he lit up 
>that was very much your Devin
>the same guy your ran through the woods with
>now you saw him in a completely new way
>but buried under the sex and romance it was still him and you
>he pulled you into a hug and he was burning to the touch
>you started gently, kissing up and down along his neck after you set the gifts on the nightstand
>he groaned at the attention and played with your hair
>"we can make that good accident something a little more official tonight."
>you agreed with the idea completely
>with a dexterity you didn't know you possessed you had your pants off completely blind with one hand
>he broke your kisses on his neck so he could lift your shirt up and over your head
>he smiled at seeing you like this
>both of you went to pull down your boxers
>he was quicker on the draw
>they were flung like a bouquet at a wedding
>you wasted no time and pulled yourself close
>even with his height over you it was clear he was the submissive one 
>he accepted you on top of him naturally
>he smelled so good
>you buried your face in the fur of his neck
>he went all out with some fancier shampoo than usual
>he moaned your name and gripped you tighter
>honestly, his height just meant more to attack
>you noticed with his neck against the bedframe he must be uncomfortable 
>so you fixed that
>and showed off at the same time
>your hands dug into his thick hips and he didn't have time to react before you yanked him fully onto the bed
>he laughed and softly smile up at you 
>then locked his legs behind you
>"that was kind of hot." 
>you kept up your attack on his neck
>one of your hands gripped at one of his nubby horns
>you both wanted tonight to last and make this perfect
>his neck consistently proved am easy target
>eventually he wanted more and he pulled your chin up
>he looked into your eyes and you shared the silence for a moment
>then he kissed you, hard
>practically deepthroating a tongue was just a familiar experience now
>it was your Devin after all
>his kiss was as messy and hungry as usual 
>both your manhoods throbbed against each other
>by now both of you were running on primal instinct 
>every touch was like a jolt 
>normally, if you weren't running on autopilot, you'd chide yourself for not doing this sooner
>this was just impossible to consider a year ago, let alone when Devin made that confession all those years ago
>you were aware enough now that you appreciated the warmth beneath you that cooed your name every time your dicks rubbed against one another
>his body was do different compare to yours, the exotic feel of fur on bare skin felt amazing
>if Devin had a human thing you had a giraffe thing now
>not that you two would need porn all that much now
>your fingers gripped as his ass as you ground against him
>he broke another messy kiss and whispered into your ear
>"before you got here I got… ready"
>you didn't need it spelled out to you
>you saw the lube on the nightstand and grabbed it
>it felt prudent to lube up your dick just to make sure it was going to be comfortable 
>he drew slow lazy circles over your chest as he watched you getting the liquid all over your shaft
>"I'm really glad my first is you"

>Devin's voice raised a few octaves when your cockhead pushed against his hole
>he wrapped his arms around you 
>"fuck…"
>it was cute to hear him whimper and you hadn't even pushed in
>his orange fur was making you sweat already
>he felt like he was burning hot
>when you finally slid forward into him the heat only swelled 
>piercing into him got him softly raking over your back while moaning out your name
>the bigger guy was putty in your hands and you had barely started
>thick hips softly pushed up towards the invader while his ring clamped down hard on the invader
>every inch was an uphill battle
>you went for his neck again and again, relaxing his grip and soothing him 
>his thick black shaft leaked precum onto his pink teddy
>he was so very different from you yet you both felt like perfectly fit puzzle pieces now
>when you bottomed out his allowed his composure came back a little
>"I'm really lucky you grabbed my dick in that theater"
>you laughed into his neck as you felt his asshole strangle your manhood
>he unbelievably tight and felt like he could get tighter if he wanted
>maybe a talent
>might top the tongue right now
>you pulled him into a kiss and now you tried your damndest to out wrestle his tongue
>your hand locked into one of his 
>his tail excitedly flipped to and fro across the bed sheets 
>he whimpered and growled into his mouth as you started moving
>the giraffe boy felt his prostate rubbed over ever stroke of your cock
>without thinking his legs spread further to let you go as deep as possible
>Devin couldn't believe this
>it had to be a dream
>everything he ever wanted
>right here right now
>Anon was his and he was Anon's
>it was better than any fantasy 
>the smell, the sounds, the touch
>all way better than some of his daydreams
>all those years of hoping and almost giving up on love
>it led here
>and it had impact
>it wasn't just Anon wanting a back up "girl" or anything unseemly like that
>Anon's goal was him alone
>he was so overwhelmed receiving all of this
>it felt right to be pinned and locked together like this
>their tongues, thier fingers, themselves
>it was like Devin was one half of something before this
>it was crazy, wild and most importantly loving
>Devin's free hand planted firmly on your lower back, he held you in
>not that you'd imagine escaping
>you'd see his ass in passing definitely 
>the ring of muscle was different than a human guy's 
>not that you'd gone around looking at guy's asses much before Devin and after Devin that was an impossibility now
>you just didn't imagine it this strong
>it was like being trapped
>it made you sweat harder to exert all your momentum into every thrust
>his thick fat ass cushioned every blow
>you shocked him to the point of gibberish when you switched thing up without pulling out
>almost like a wrestling match you'd repositioned your hold on him
>all the while trying to keep up the pace
>at first you'd both gone for missionary but now he found himself the little spoon on his side
>your hand had gripped onto his thigh and had his leg up in the air
>his own manhood bounced with every thrust into him
>he murmured about being so close
>you decided to push things along and he whined when you started jerking him off with his hand
>yours over his
>he immediately shot his seed in a spray across you both and the bed sheets
>his body spasmed and he managed to get you to cum within seconds of him
>"oh fuck. that's it. it's better than I thought it'd feel."
>you tried your damndest to pump in and out when you came but he tightened around you
>"no you don't. I'm not losing a drop of it."
>his breath was ragged as he egged you on to cum your first load deep in him
>you hungrily attacked his neck again and he came again without notice
>it really was his weak point
>you ran your hand up to his heaving chest
>both of you were silent in the aftermath
>"I really wish you'd have grabbed my dick sooner"
>he laughed to himself and you were quick to join in
>you ended up closing your eyes briefly and resting your head on his arm
>"all tuckered out? was I that good?"
>a challenge 
>his voice had that sultry edge to it again after he recollected himself
>the teasing would be met with another attack 
>after all you both had the night
>your dick was hardening up again and you felt his nipples through the teddy
>you were going to ruin this boy
>he was getting hard again too
>no wonder he wanted to make sure he cleaned up this place himself 
>this time you wanted to try another position
>he squeaked when you picked his hips up and had him on his knees on the bed
>God his ass looked inviting
>this was it
>what you'd been missing
>all the love and company and…
>you smacked the left cheek softly
>he shot his neck up with a "eek" that didn't match the whole attempt at seduction right before he was on all fours
>with his neck you wanted to try something with the doggy style
>his horns were as always excellent handlebars
>you turned his head to kiss him while your dick slid between that ample ass
>his couldn't help but grind back
>all while moaning back into your mouth
>he accepted you without question, submitting quickly again
>in the dim warmth of cheap hotel lamplight you both enjoyed slowly grinding
>you weren't ready to enter just yet
>despite him pleading
>and he definitely pleaded
>even started giving you puppy dog eyes while grinding his ass on your dick
>his cheeks were generous enough you could hot dog him if you wanted
>rubbing your manhood over his greedy hole was making him desperate, slowly but surely
>you asked if this felt like tuckered out 
>"as your boyfriend it's my job to tease you. you're not supposed to tease me. it's not fair."
>he briefly laughed and smiled up at you
>breaking the kiss allowed for continued assaults along his nape and shoulders
>he must have really liked it because at one point he grabbed your head when you made to pull back
>that whole neck area was yours and yours alone and he wanted you to have it
>Devin was in bliss right now
>while he really really really wanted you to go for round two all the foreplay told him you were the one
>this wasn't just a pump and dump
>you genuinely wanted him
>that confession all those years ago felt like it would be unrequited 
>yet here you both were 
>sharing in each other in the most intimate of ways
>he had promised his heart to you all those years ago
>now the rest of his body was catching up with that promise and he was in heaven
>occasionally he tried to maneuver his ass just so you'd slip in with an accidental thrust
>but your penis was too smart for that little bit of trickery
>you just kept sliding right over the hole
>that's when Devin unleashed his secret weapon
>"I love you," he breathed out 
>dammit
>Devin caught on fairly early the easiest way to get you to do something was those three little words
>you had no choice but to fuck him now
>it was slightly easier to push in this time around
>you had to grab the lube to give yourself another coat to make sure
>Devin's hair was a mess now
>that would always stick out to you in your memories
>such a silly tiny little detail
>mingled in with the smell of sex and some new scent he'd tried on before you got here
>smelled sweet
>when your hips met he groaned out and looked you in the eyes
>the size difference made you really appreciate how much of a ass he had on him
>it was thicker than so girl's you'd seen but not so huge it would be grotesque 
>just like perfect 
>like all of him
>you couldn't get back that gap in school before you'd gotten back but you both were going to make up for lost time
>every thrust had his cock swaying, the tip just an inch from touching the bedsheets
>he had that thing but he preferred yours 
>that was an ego boost if anything
>though maybe you'd eventually get used to this enough to give him a blowjob in the future
>maybe
>you eyed his slender waist and traced your gaze up to his again
>both of you rutted against each other like breeding animals now
>it was your turn to tell him you loved him when he came 
>the way he arched his back and nearly collapsed onto the bed was burned into your memory
>however you weren't "tuckered out" yet
>Devin would get his wish
>once more you grabbed him, this time you slid back to sit on the edge of the bed
>you'd pulled him up to sit on your lap
>"wait, what are you doing?"
>you wrapped your arms around his waist and he gasped
>"wait I'm too big for this. don't try it."
>another challenge
>this was less mocking in tone and more concern
>sure he may be bigger 
>but you wanted to cum
>his protest was cut off by you jack hammering into him
>"holy shit!"
>his tail awkwardly flicked into your face several times and he was indeed hefty but damn the torpedoes
>your hips moved with a strength you didn't know you had, though the bed probably also helped
>one more slap to your face with his tail gave you an idea
>you softly grabbed it with your teeth
>you have thought Devin touched an electrical socket with how he reacted
>this time he had a dry orgasm, his teddy and the bed sheets sullied enough
>he arched his back against you and you couldn't help emptying your balls into him again
>this time you fell backwards onto the bed, dragging him with you
>you were squished face to fuzzy orange shoulder blade 
>you could feel his heart rate come back down against your cheek
>"you are nuts," he weakly replied as he laid on you
>you didn't fight his weight on you
>the smell of your boyfriend was pretty much all you could breathe in
>tonight was amazing
>and you decided to show off your secret weapon tonight too
>flowers and chocolate weren't the only things you'd picked up
>it had been easy to get away to do it the other day
>with your new work it was easy to justify a big purchase 
>well sort of big
>you lost count of how long you'd both laid there
>he was suddenly aware he was laying on you after a while
>he tried getting up but you hugged his waist tight
>"I'm probably crushing you"
>nope
>holding tight 
>but you did suggest a compromise 
>you'd release Devin only if you two grabbed a shower together
>"oh that's all I have to do?"
>you could hear the wry smile in his voice
>God you were happy accidents happened
>you did ask if he was all tuckered out
>"oh I'm never hearing the end of that am I?"
>nope
>"you're lucky you're cute you know"
>that dinky hotel room played host to you two finally consummating everything and you wanted one final gesture that night
>when you both sat up you ignored how sore your hips felt
>you really hadn't let up when you had him riding you
>you watched him pull the teddy off and you still could not figure out whether he looked better with or without it
>he gently elbowed you to catch your attention and that made you remember
>he looked quizzical as you scrambled through your pants
>when you slipped a promise ring on his finger he started tearing up
>maybe that was a little much too soon or whatever
>but the way he started tearing up made you pull him into a tight hug
>you thought back
>how courageous he had to be to do that confession all those years ago
>you whispered up to him that you like liked him too and that ring was physical proof
>the giraffe hugged you back with a strength his girly frame didn't seem to possess 
>it was about 1 AM and a hot shower next to him sounded like the best thing ever right now
>you both separated and got into the bathroom
>the shower was tinier than the one at your place
>cramped up next to Devin wasn't the worst proposition though
>at least you could both clean up
>he occasionally stared at his and your rings
>you were glad he told you all those years ago
>while it wasn't immediate then and you kicked yourself for it now, hindsight was a bitch
>so might as well enjoy the present
>and possibly the future
>3 years
>a lot can change 
>things didn't go as planned
>your parents didn't approve but to hell with it 
>you dropped out of college 
>switching over to a trade, your career accelerated rapidly
>you had your motives for quitting
>yes a diploma would have done a lot
>but it would have taken you out of this town
>it had grown on you
>all of it
>you'd rather help work at a sleepy electricians in a sleepy town instead of getting stuck in an office
>as for Devin…
>actually going fantastic 
>your parents were more pissed you dropped out than you were gay and bringing home a giant boy
>they did remember Devin so that helped tide them over a little
>he was of course a flustered mess the entire time
>you talked that night in your bed
>obviously the cohabitation had worked out
>he was leaned up against you and had to look over his shoulder to look you in the eye
>"I'm scared I'll weigh you down. I don't want to make you regret your life"
>there was a pain there behind his eyes
>sometimes he expressed fear that this was too good to be true
>that it wasn't good 
>that things wouldn't work out
>his anxiety came out occasionally
>every time you'd hold him tight and hush his fears best you could
>like now
>you kissed along the back of his neck and grabbed his hand and kissed that ring you gave him in that dingy hotel room
>you wanted this
>no regrets
>you felt proud he could quit another job 
>he worked part time at the pizza place now
>partially because you'd pulled the pizza boy sex roleplay multiple times now
>you were saving up for a house slowly but surely
>ideally your old house
>if you did get it you were definitely marrying him in those woods near it
>you and Devin weren't exactly open in town but you'd ingrained yourself with the community despite that
>helped everyone seemed to like Devin
>he was even more chipper since he'd gotten serious with you
>in those 3 years you'd grown together 
>despite the fears and uncertainty you refused to break that promise
>that little Devin you'd met in the woods that day demanded your heart
>he wasn't assertive enough to command your heart, you just couldn't betray those same sweet eyes on you
>it wouldn't matter if you were 20 or 80
>the giraffe boy had grown into your home and your future
