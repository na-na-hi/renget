in conclusion, voteanon needs to be fired from this job because they couldn't properly do it correctly. when you put "pic related" in the thread, you should post the votepost with the options like all others did instead of your fanart of your chuuba.: MyFrickingReligionRightHere.jpg should be MyFrickingIncompetanceRightHere.jpg. If you take up the responsibility of being the voteanon, you need to do your job instead of joking around because dumb anons like me exist!!!!!! YOURE FIRED!!!!

i don't think that will fix anything as most problems are petty!!! i am extremely sad to have seen ALL the nijiwriters except alice and emma get driven off because of the useless petty drama that this thread encourages against them!!! I MISS DRAGONSISTER, DRAGOON, ROSEMAIDEN, PPSENPAI, COMFYSENPAI, ROSESENPAI, and ALL THE KINDRED!!! </3. i remember alice getting blamed for me saying i did not like some wild beast being put in ap global by the same person who is accusing her lying about jidf. you see, that is right there why many writers left and why i am all alone in the south aside from vnug, who I WANT TO INTERACT WITH ME!!! i am sure this will be pushed off as biased, but i am biased here so sorry!!!
