## Story
The world is based off of the *Gates to Infinity* entry into the PMD series and will feature locations from that game. However, it also draws from Super Mystery Dungeon and the limited world lore presented to the players. This will involve usage of the continents and some existing locations, but will otherwise be heavily modified to be a distinctive experience. 
- It is important to consider when writing these things, sharing plotlines in the dedicated planning rooms can help to clear up any confusion regarding lore.
- There is no planned usage of the Bittercold or Dark Matter as is presented in the games.
***
## Origins
What you'll need to know in order to make the decision when making your character. We *do* recommend picking a Human Origin since that's the name of the PMD game (and why we exist in the first place), but you're not barred from diverging if you so desire.
- **Mainline Earth**: A world that regularly has Pokémon saturating every facet of life. They are the culture, integrated into society, and deeply rooted into the hierarchies of communities. You cannot imagine a world without them. Together, you have grown dependent on each other. The Pokémon League is omnipresent and partially integrated into government operations. In any case, your media might even be similar to Prime Earth's... if a bit lost in translation. Oh, hey, the Ninja Squirtles in on! Want to watch it? 
- **Prime Earth**: Earth as we know it. The animals here aren't supernatural nor do the criminals organizations have comically grand desires to rule the world with an aspect of reality. A thug would probably would just mug you and leave you for dead. But despite the planet's relatively boring surface-level appearance, there's always something more to it. You are at the center of a inter-dimensional looking glass, peering into different realities and gazing into infinity, sometimes without even consciously knowing. Open a book and let's see what door that opens...
- **PMD Earth**: A planet that has never been touched by humanity on a larger scale. There is no presence of them here aside from old tales about these strange mythical creatures. In any case, Mystery Dungeons and other Pokémon is what you know, maybe even less considering your knowledge might be limited to your immediate surroundings. At best, you've managed to somewhat claw your way to the Age of Sail and formed societies in cities. However, you still have Nobles and Serfs, Villagers and Lords, or even tribes.
- **Ultra Space**: The inbetween the borders of the Pokémon worlds. Things fall in and rarely ever fall back out. Usually it tends to be non-sentient life. However, an exception long ago has created a group of hardy humans and their Ultra Beasts attempting to live out life in a reality with no natural light. The Ultra Planes are desolate and volatile, and the city is ruled under martial law. It's post-apocalypse life, scrounging what you can get to make do.
	- This final Origin world is only available if you roll an Ultra Beast or are planning on using one as an NPC.

### Humans
For your origin, you're allowed to freely select between two different Earths. This is the only way for humans to be present within the story.
- You have the choice of being from *Mainline Earth*. This may have represented your character originally being gifted a partner to fight with or owning a family Pokémon as a pet. Maybe you're a Wagie, Trainer, Breeder, Criminal, or whatever occupation fits your character's fanciful backstory. However, there exists things here that would confuse someone from Prime Earth. Batman? You mean Crobat-Man? Despite this, for all your life here, you've never heard a Pokémon talk to you...
- Your other option is being from *Prime Earth*. You're just a casual individual who might have never even dabbled with those new-fangled Pokey-Mans, or maybe you've got a lot more knowledge of its series then you're letting on. Perhaps your "foresight" might be accurate enough to remember the names of locations or characters. You hope.

Your human origin can also be from any reasonable time period. From the ancient time of Hisui or a sailor in Columbus' era, if you believe you can play them accurately, there's no reason you can't try it out. If you can't, it'll just default to the most modern time of 20XX.

!!! note The following are IQ skills...
	One of the two will be given according to your choice in backstory.
Now aside from that, PMD normally strips your character of their past memories (mostly because it's easier for you to self-insert into the protagonist that way), but here, you're allowed to choose:
- *Amnesia* means that your character is unable to recall anything about their past life—retrograde, they call it. However, one thing remains a constant: they always remember that they used to be human.
	- You are given Amneplasticity.
- *Fragmented* is the in-between the two. You are missing pieces here and there, painting an incomplete picture of the past behind you. Faces, names, and places might escape you, like sand slipping between your fingers.
	- You are given Rememberance.
- *Anamnesis* allows your character's memories to stay completely intact, with not a scratch on the ride here. Of course, this only guarantees nothing happens on the transition between worlds. If you've got baggage, you get to keep that, too!
	- You are given Rememberance.

### Natives
(Defaults to *PMD Earth*) You've always lived here all your life and you know of no other. Your family and friends are Pokémon. In fact, you are a Pokémon! And you have never been anything else. You know the way of the land, the history of your town, and how the Mystery Dungeons are not places to trifle with. Maybe you've lived a simple life in a village or watched a Guild from afar all this time, but now...? Your story begins here.

### Outworlders
Maybe you remember another time, where towers of glass touched the sky. But you did not help create them. You remember a time with Humans always shouting and the thrill of battle racing in your blood. Yet... you were not one of these Humans. You're a Pokémon, through and through. But now there are no more Humans here. Just more... Pokémon. Where are you? You have no Human to guide you now, or the bond of familiar faces to watch your back. One thing is for certain, you're not a hero or meant to save the world. You are here by accident and chance: an interdimensional hiccup. As an Outworlder, the whole idea of a Pokémon society is an entirely foreign concept! You may need a hand to fit in...
- *Voyager* implies that the trip here was consensual. Perhaps you struck a deal with a powerful creature to be cast to somewhere safe or you saw a weird crack in reality and decided to take the leap.
- *Wanderer* is for when the trip here was less-than-willing. It's a possibility you were the victim of an experiment of a maniacal group of humans, sticking you into a strange contraption against your best desires. 

!!! note Natives and Outworlders... 
	Natives are granted a starting budget of **450₽**. 
	Are given the choice to select any combination of three as a starting set from these items:
- Oran Berry
- Heal Seed
- Stun Seed
- Totter Seed
- Blast Seed
- Power Seed
- Bulwark Seed

You may also have any cosmetic items (such as non-combat functional apparel) or trinkets that are relevant to your character's backstory (a family heirloom or a lucky charm). If your background permits it, you may also have access to one egg move from your heritage.

Along with that, it's important to remember that as a Native (or even an Outworlder depending on how your backstory might go), you have access to a natural identity within the world. While this won't automatically grant you any free passes, it's definitely a leg up on the displaced humans who just started existing about one minute ago. You definitely have friends, families... acquaintances, probably. Now, if you've burned your bridges on the way out here, that's something else entirely.

## The World
A planet inhabited solely by Pokémon. That's how the story goes each time it's repeated to the freshly transported human. There are a total of five major landmasses; Air, Grass, Mist, Water, and Sand.

**The Air Continent** experiences temperate weathers, with all four seasons available year-round. 
- Faction: **Council of Clans**
- Wild and poorly developed, the Air Continent is occupied by multiple clans. Some might have permanent presence in an area, while others lead nomadic lifestyles. What they do all have in common is that they convene for a monthly council, under the peace of their patron, Rayquaza. They are led by a clan elder.
	- Their clan names are inspired by the earth and all that it contains, as they do not ever believe themselves to be above their protecting patron, Rayquaza, and choosing anything else would be a sign of hubris.
		- Clan Skarn, elder: Druddigon (name: Elder Two Spirals, Claws Bared)
		- Clan Malachite, elder: Dubwool (name: Elder Soft Meadows, Five Fruits)
		- Clan Beryl, elder: Breloom (name: Elder Seven Leaves, Spontaneous Motion)
		- Clan Almandine, elder: Haxorus (name: Elm Chopper, Fiftyfold Fatherer)
		- Clan Morion, elder: Ekans (name: Elder Coiling Appetence, Scour Devour)
		- Clan Hematite, elder: Bisharp (name: General Razor, Blade Breaker)
		- Clan Cerussite, elder: Walrein (name: Roswen Flame Eater)
		- Clan Batholith
		- Clan Gneiss
		- Clan Marl
		- Clan Galena
	- There are several villages within the influence of a single clan. Their size and amount of villages can vary, especially depending on the habits of the clan itself.

**The Grass Continent** has a similar range to that of the Air Continent, but normally sees larger open stretches of prairie or savannas. Springs and summers are longer. 
- Faction: **Ho'oha**
- A theocracy known for their colorful and lively festivals, they are led by an Arch Bearer, empowered by the favor of their patron, Ho-Oh. Many of these festivals involve fire and symbols or gestures of rebirth. Almost every major settlement has a temple or church dedicated to the worship of Ho-Oh or the legendary beasts.
	- One of the most prominent celebrations is known as the "Guiding of the Temple," where many Flying-types or those capable of flight, volunteer to tether themselves to the flying temple of Ho-Oh to bring it across the continent in a specific looping path.

**The Water Continent** has a wet and dry season. Although, "dry" might be an overstatement. Experiencing a tropical climate with periods of heavy raining and flooding, three major rivers run from the core sea in the center.
- Faction: **Ava-lu Empire**
- An ocean-spanning empire, represented by the figurehead princess, a Quaxwell. Wealthy from their control and expertise on the water, the capital is located in the center of the only sea in the Water Continent, an impressive floating city. The empire also strives to maintain a large fleet and regularly combats piracy.
	- Small boats are the main method of transport if you cannot swim between the city's water channels. Boat locks also lead to the elevated dammed district where wealthier individuals generally choose to live.

**The Mist Continent** is typically colder than all the other continents, with the northern half of the continent completely covered in ice and colossal glaciers. Winters are long and the summers are cold.
- Faction: **Rantrum**
- Led by the recently crowned Rex Tyrantrum, the capital of the territory is located on the slopes of the second tallest mountain in the continent, situated close to the frozen northerly oceans. The area is a natural fortress, known to be almost impervious to invasion. His influence is enforced by the lesser tribal nobles, most of whom share some form of blood or familial connection.
	- Ultimately, he seeks to be remembered just like his predecessors, looking for a grand accomplishment to cement his place in ancestral history.

**The Sand Continent** can be a fairly inhospitable environment for most creatures, as a majority of the land is brutal desert or valleys of rocks and mountains. However, there is a lush area where the ocean pushes into the continent. 
- Faction: **Liokio Dynasty**
- Relatively new in comparison to the other factions, the fledgling kingdom is situated in the forgiving habitable band of the Sand Continent. And despite being young, they have experienced a meteoric rise in power, with a navy strong enough to contend with the Avalu Empire. The city state has a massive ocean wall that further separates the gulf. Structured and led by their Pharaoh, whose influence wanes the further away from the coast.
	- They primarily export many important crystals for evolution and moves.

Warrior Culture: While not always involved in constant conflict and fighting, Pokémon can be expected to elevate their social standing through honing their skills in combat and improving their fighting capabilities. They can still do other activities, such as gathering food or building, but those who can prove themselves capable champions are shot up into stardom. While not always the case, this can partially lead into the idea that *Might Makes Right,* that the stronger you are, the more you are qualified to do so without impunity.
- Pokémon might befriend each other after having a particularly nasty fight. Sometimes, that's how you forge the greatest bonds. By going into a battle and pummeling each other with magic.

Advanced Metallurgy is not part of the technological advances Pokémon have made, so you will rarely see them forging weapons for themselves. If any, Steel-Types usually have a monopoly on most metal resources, often cultivating them to feed themselves and their families. However, Pokémon do create basic construction tools and supplies, enough to build sturdier city structures and other sea-faring contraptions. It might also be readily spotted for use in cooking.

### Food
What do Pokémon eat in a world with only Pokémon? While most adventurers will default to the might Apple to fill their bellies while out and about, the common folk often make do with whatever berries that grow on the continent and whatever vegetables they can find.
- While food has similar preservation methods (aging, drying, smoking, salt-curing, freezing, fermenting, spicing), there are some unique methods. Ghost-types are known to employ the process of "petrifying" foods, which can then be stored indefinitely. However, the process can be intensive, and the services are usually left to merchants and ruling powers wealthy enough to afford them. In order to be consumable again, they must be charmed to dispel the curse. 
	- Berries with healing properties can be juiced to preserve foods for very long periods of time, provided the juice is not excessively contaminated or dried. Once dried, they are no longer useful. In certain places, healing berry powders might be considered a form of bartering currency.
- Those with access to the means, either through wealth or adventure, might have the ability to utilize magical orbs/devices to simply suspend perishables.

#### Berries by Continent
**Universal Berries**
These are found growing anywhere despite whatever conditions they might encounter. Hardy fruits, huh?
- Berries with effects: Oran, Cheri, Chesto, Pecha, Rawst, Aspear, Persim, Sitrus, Enigma, Razz
- Standard Berries: Lum, Leppa, Starf

**Found in the Grass and Air Continent**
Since these two share comparable climates, this allows these berries to grow without having the need for extreme adaptations.
- Coba, Rabuta, Wacan, Tanga, Kasib, Haban, Colbur, Custap, Micle, Grepa, Pomeg, Pamtre, Tamato, Nomel, Wepear, Magost

**Found in the Water Continent**
These berries have grown to adapt to the constant rainfall, flooding, and generally humid climate of the continent. 
- Figy, Wiki, Mago, Agauv, Iapapa, Watmel, Nanab, Rindo, Babiri, Rowap, Qualot, Kelpsy, Durian, Pinap

**Found in the Mist Continent**
These are berries that are used to the colder temperatures experienced in the continent.
- Bluk, Cornn, Yache, Kebia, Chilan, Jaboca, Hondew, Spelon, Belue

**Found in the Sand Continent**
Berries here are very hardy and have managed to survive without much need for water.
- Liechi, Ganlon, Salac, Petaya, Apicot, Lansat, Passho, Shuca, Charti

**Meat Berries**
Strange fruits from an even stranger tree. Identified by the sharp, metallic perfume-pollen, bone-yellow bark, and reddish leaves, these trees are found exclusively in the depths of Mystery Dungeons. Adding further onto their mystery, unlike normal trees, these Meat Trees have been known to migrate from dungeon to dungeon. Forced to scour and brave the dangers of the poorly understood dungeons, these prospective "hunters" risk life and limb to find this coveted delicacy. 

### Major Organizations
Despite the many continents separating everyone, there are some groups who have set foot on every single one.
- The *Guild League* oversees the Guilds across the continents and provides them legitimacy, functioning badges, and job requests. They also make sure they're held to a high standard. They do not have any actual teams attached to them, often times commissioning already active teams to work in their name.
	- *HAPPI (Helping Adventurous Pokémon Prosper Incentive)* is a program run by the Guild League to assist those who might not want to join a Guild (or be unable to). While not as good as a Guild, basic supplies are sent to the budding Pokémon Team to get them started.
- *Kecleon Mercantile Clan* primarily sells goods to the adventuring type, aggressively cornering the market for total domination. While they cannot compete with the local shops, the harder-to-find supplies that an Exploration Team might need is their specialty.
- The *Constabulary* consists of the Magnemite Line and the Beldum Line, helping to enforce some form of order. Due to the nature of the work, there is a chance they become overwhelmed and resort to posting Outlaw Hunt job requests to towns or Guilds, asking for assistance to catch a particularly unruly criminal. They also run jails to help punish and rehabilitate the captured criminals.

### Homes and Settlements
Pokémon live in all kinds of places, on the land, (sometimes) air, and seas. They form their homes from whatever materials are nearby, often creating structures that seemingly blend into the landscape.
- However, some might construct what are commonly known as "Head Houses," homes that are meant to represent the appearance of the owner on the outside. This specific architectural style was originally popular with wealthier individuals a long time ago. Now it is used as a status symbol to flaunt wealth. It also lends itself to the general truthfulness expected of each other, now you know where your specific neighbors are!
- Entering the home of a Pokémon who has left the main entrance to their home unlocked is a quiet invitation to enter. Although usually, it's polite to announce your presence when doing so. Stealing is still frowned upon, so don't do it while the host is being gracious! Entering a home when the inhabitant has blocked access might end in your explosive eviction.
- Each settlement usually has a handful of Adventurer or Exploration teams operating out of them. Larger settlements might house one or multiple guilds. They might even be competing.
- While monospecies communities or settlements are very rare, most will end up finding they live in a village that shares one common type. Of course, it gets a little more obvious if the settlement is underwater, but you get the idea.
- What is a village? What is a town? Usually, a village tends to be less-developed compared to a town and might even have a smaller population (although this is not always the case). Towns also tend to be situated in favorable locations, along popular roads or travel routes. Villages tend to form from a gathering of a local community.

**Public Services**
Restricted either by the construction or location of their homes, some Pokémon might travel to public places in a village or town to clean or relax. 
- Bathhouses & Hot Springs: Services that are generally open all-year round for cleaning and relaxation. Might also be a great place to hear about community news or gossip.
- Iceboxes: Places for Pokémon who really need negative temperatures to cool off. They are built lower underground and can be very cold. Iceboxes double as places to store food for long periods of time.
- Greenhouses: For Grass-Types in the colder months where sunlight and warmth become increasingly important. During other seasonal weathers, generally are left empty. However, some Grass-Types with specialty needs might visit these frequently, regardless of current conditions.
- Smokehouses: Typically frequented by Fire-Types of all kinds, Smokehouses are stout constructions on the outskirts of a town. Built to trap as much smoke and heat, it is a place for Fire-Types to socialize. Patrons are expected to burn and enjoy the smoke from various woods offered by the house. Doing so changes the smell of their flames (adding hints from the woods they have burnt) and helps them to burn stronger and brighter. Some might even become Wood Connoisseurs, befriending Grass-Types to find the best woods they can try.

#### Guilds
Together, we're even stronger! Pokémon form Guilds to get benefits from having a large group of adventurers who are always willing to help one another out. Almost like a big family. Guilds construct their bases next to towns and usually have some form of specialty: Rescue, Exploration, Expedition, or even Justice... there's a lot a Guild can do.
- They are supported by the Guild League, who supplies them with equipment, a steady stream of job requests, and regulates their activities.
- Guilds also offer training, reputation with their name, contact points for the Guild League, rooms and meals for their members, and equipment. There are pros and cons to joining one.

#### Trade and Travel
The primary currency of this world is known as Pokécoin or just normally referred to as Poké, (but may also be abbreviated further to a numerical value and the symbol, for example: **100₽** or **100P**) and is what most shops or businesses might accept as legal tender. However, this is not the only option for one to conduct a transaction. For a majority of the world who do not live in cities or regularly dive into dungeons, bartering is the other method most Pokémon can be expected to use. There's always value in a berry or crop!
- There are also Gold Bars, but these are normally only exchanged in specialty shops or locations.

On the topic of travel, while they may be separated by a vast ocean, the greater world isn't entirely contained just within their own bubbles. Two main services provide access to different continents to both civilians and Pokémon Teams.
- *Lapras Travel Liner* primarily serves customers who'd prefer to keep themselves grounded (or at least not flying) as they move from one place to another. While a majority of their fleet are made up of Lapras, they have other Water-Types willing to ferry a paying voyager.
- *Tropius Travel Agency* offers flights to and from anywhere in the world! Fast and (mostly) reliable, this is the go-to choice for teams who are on a time limit for a request or job. While a Tropius might be the face of organization, they're made up of dozens of Flying-Types. Also, if you're carrying something heavy, you might want to look into paying extra for a strong Flying-Type... or just head to the *Lapras Travel Liners.*

Meanwhile, mail or other packages can be moved around through two services.
- *Pelipper Post Office* handles a bulk of deliveries across the world and often are the primary method that the Guild League sends notifications or job requests to Guilds and Teams. Their buildings are often easily identifiable as they are giant Pelipper heads.
- *Delibird Deliveries* is the premiere transportation option for messages and small goods known for their reliability and efficiency, taking on any business from individuals to other large organizations. While most of the staff consist of Delibird, they do not discriminate potential hires, and seek to best utilize different species of Pokémon by assigning them to routes suitable for their skills. They specialize mostly in letters and small packages, but when larger shipments need to be moved, they don't shy away from collaborating with *Lapras Travel Liners* or *Tropius Travel Agency.*
	- Don't tell anyone, but they're secretly rivals with the *Pelipper Post Office.*

### Footprint Runes
[List of All Footprint Runes](https://rentry.co/tmd2many_prints)

The written language of the world, formed from the various symbols and "prints" of its inhabitants. With all the things a Pokémon can do, each species has its own meanings when written down on paper (and can change depending on the context of a situation). As there are over 900 known species, learning the language can be both a mighty task and boon to those who accept the challenge. Most have learned just enough to ask for help on Job Requests!

#### Language
Pokémon do not have words or vernacular that might be particularly human in origin, so this should be accurately reflected in characters or the world at large. This is also important for characters with human origins, as Pokémon might not understand references or would be able to deduce that a character might've previously been human. In any case, just be mindful of what you have Natives using in their dialogue. Be careful with your words!

Examples may include:
- People
- Man
- Woman
- Mankind
- Measurements such as Meters or Kilograms

**Measurements of Time**
Generally, they still either go by days or nights (depending if they're naturally nocturnal) and measure things by minutes or seconds. That is mostly so we can be consistent with descriptions and not having to smash together some wacky stand-in. However, they will measure longer measurements differently.
- Instead of a month, the phase of the Moon is used to measure the passage of time, following the cycle from New to Full.
- Instead of a year, it is divided into seasons (four seasons to a year). While not all continents experience all four changes, this has become the standard. 
- Instead of the the typical names for months, such as January, December, etc., months go like this:
	- First Moon of...
	- Second Moon of...
	- Last/Third Moon of...
		- With the final word consisting of a Force of Nature Pokémon's name, each of which correlate to a specific season. 
		- EX: Second Moon of Thundurus (Summer)

### Mystery Dungeons
Strange areas that are found all around the world. This seems to be a location where space-time works differently, folding in its limited area to trap individuals into an endless echo. While they may draw from their surroundings to create the interior of the "Dungeon," they can still be hostile environments and oftentimes catches unsuspecting individuals off-guard. 
- There are formations within the Mystery Dungeons known as "stairs," which are stair-like structures created from nearby materials going either up or down. It might be as simple as a hill or as complex as cooling magma forming steps.
- The limit of those who can enter a dungeon at the same time is four, as any more than that causes the dungeon to become unstable to traverse. It might even split the group! If you've gone in as a team of five, there's a chance one of you might get separated into a parallel dungeon!
- Multiple teams can enter a dungeon at the same time, however, this creates a parallel dungeon between them. Each group (should they be subscribing to the limit of four) will find themselves in unique versions of the same dungeon. Only when the influence of the dungeon wanes can they regroup.
- However, there is an exception to this. Pokémon who are trapped or outlaws being hunted can be tracked and marked on a paper (known as a job request), which allows a single team to enter the same instance of their dungeon without being moved to a parallel space. They still need to venture to the same dungeon "depth" to find the target, regardless.

**Rescue and Job Requests**
When a Pokémon gets lost or trapped in a dungeon, they don't have to worry about bringing a pen and paper to write a request for help... and then somehow get it out to a guild. Handled by the Guild League, they have a group of Psychic-Types and Fairy-Types scanning the areas to contact trapped individuals and send out job requests on their behalf. Usually they discuss rewards to entice a faster rescue, but sometimes they cannot keep a stable or safe conversation, so sometimes a job might have a reward listed as: "Reward Unknown."
- Most of the time, Pokémon offer their reward when brought to the guild or shortly after, normally an item or food (they're mostly civilians, anyway!). Sometimes Poké, if they have any. If they are unable to pay, they usually give an IOU to the guild, either later paying them food, supplies, or labor. If not, the Guild League covers the cost. A very large majority always pay the day of or soon, so guilds don't have to worry about that!
- Guilds are obligated to complete every single emergency job request they get. Failing to do so lands them fines or penalties from the Guild League. Even if the rewards are meager, at the end of the day, someone needs some serious help!

## Pokémon
With hundreds of different species, sizes, and evolutions, everyone so far has managed to get along. While there might be existing species rivalries still present, for the most part, things have worked out.
- Battling is in your blood! Most Pokémon won't turn down a good fight or the opportunity to spectate a match. Expect settlements of all sizes to at least have a small part of their nearby land cleared out just for fights. 
- Normally, most Pokémon are naturally friendly and honest. Lying tends not to be the strong suit of many, and those who are perceived to be good at doing so are not looked upon favorably. They can still embellish a story, though. 
- Your average villager (one who does not constantly battle or delve headfirst into danger) tends to be around Levels 20-30. Some older Pokémon might be Level 40.
- Natives can be expected to know their own type match-ups (what they are weak against and what they are strong against), but might not know an opponent's typings all the time. However, sometimes a Pokémon might be able to instinctively determine an opponent's typing if they are on either ends of the effective spectrum (but will have more trouble if they are neutral). 
	- The same would apply to moves a Pokémon might use. Knowing what moves their opponent might have would either be impossible or highly unlikely unless they're mind-readers or well-studied. Considering the lack of unified informational sources, the latter is also equally unlikely. Perhaps local leaders might popularize their species' Signature Moves, but otherwise, most might go unknown.

### Names
While out and about, you might not see the use of an actual name too often, particularly one reminiscent of the "human" style you are used to. Most Pokémon expect each other to use their species name (and will give the species name first if asked who they might be). If there are multiple Pokémon in a conversation or area, they might then divulge an actual name.

Names are created by:
- Traits or appearance of the Pokémon, sometimes shortened in order to be easier to say.
- Titles or accomplishments they are known for. Sometimes the title of "Elder" or "Chief" might double as a name for one who leads a village or clan.
- Parts or segments of the Species' name, rearranged to make a name.

**Remember:** do not give Pokémon a human name unless it would make sense (as their backstory allows it). Otherwise, if they have a Native Origin, acquiring a human name would not be consistent.

Here are some name examples. Longer names might be shortened during actual use:
- Sparks
- Ember
- River Restless
- Radiant Light
- Dodging Arrow
- Countless Reeds
- Lunar Lapse
- Six Burning Stones
- Echo In Crystals
- Four Stars in Splendor
- Red Skies Above
- Comets in a Glass
- Two Scarves beneath Serenity
- Broken Circle, Uneven Rhythm
- Crashing Waves, One Thousand Songs 
- Hushing Whispers under Waning Moonlight

### Aging and Maturity
They tend not to have very long stages of "useless or defenseless infant," compared to a human. While it may vary from species, they still experience a time when they must be taught to understand their surroundings. Usually they can just battle straight out of the egg (with several degrees of "effective"). Even evolution might not signify maturity between individuals. When they have proven themselves capable of handling tough situations and maintaining a level of composure, that is when the other villagers recognize their transition into adulthood.
- Alternatively, they could just get older. There's still experience that is coupled with age. A first-stage evolution with a lot of seasons would be treated differently than another first-stage who hasn't seen their first winter.
- Pokémon have a tendency to remain in their prime for much longer than a human would.
- Age is measured in seasons. If you are 21 years old, you would roughly be 84~ seasons. The following might illustrate the **average** experience (correlating from levels):
	- At 30 seasons, you can be expected to travel outside of the village without too much supervision.
	- At 50 seasons, you might be entrusted with a job or participating in activities to contribute to the village.
	- At around 70-100 seasons, you can sit at the village meetings and be eligible
	- At 200 seasons, you might start feeling the effects of your age.
- Bugs might need to reach their final evolution to be taken seriously.
- Dragons tend to experience the longest juvenile stages, taking a long time to achieve autonomy or evolution. This might cause Dragon-Types to have deeper and stronger familial bonds.

### Energies
**Infinity Energy**
In the world of just Pokémon, there is one main energy that fuels the power found behind Moves. This is known as "Infinity Energy" (although Natives might not even refer to it as that), capable of calling upon flames or causing storms, each Pokémon has varying amounts of this energy. Passing a certain threshold even unlocks a state of Awakening and perhaps even a temporary evolution above what is known to be possible.
- This energy comes naturally to a Pokémon and can be freely harnessed into attacks even from the moment they are born! This reservoir of energy is easily manipulated by the user and matches the vessel: hence why moves that are a similar type to the Pokémon are strengthened.
- Too much Infinity Energy or prolonged states over this threshold can cause the Pokémon to lose control, typically described as a "berserk state."

**Zero Energy**
A type of energy exclusive to humans (which is the only type of energy they can naturally obtain). This is a separate kind of energy that interacts with Infinity Energy in a unique way. Rather than acting as a reservoir of energy that naturally regenerates, Zero Energy has the capability to control and give focus to Infinity Energy. This is responsible for the strange interactions and tangible "bonds" between a human and their Pokémon. 
- An Ex-Human gets a blend of these two energies (primarily Zero Energy) causing their moves to appear erratic or primalistic, yet paradoxically focused and refined at the same time. Only an experienced individual might discern the differences. The reason for this appearance is because humans do not have the inherent power to access Infinity Energy and must make do with an energy that normally enhances or controls from an external perspective. 
	- A human might at first display difficulty attempting to use or form a move.

**Aura**
While the other two are generally intangible forces, Aura is the radiation that emanates from around a vessel. Every living thing has Aura, and thus, a small amount of Infinity Energy. The more Energy something contains, the greater it radiates or bleeds Aura. To those who are sensitive to Aura, a tree might vaguely resemble itself when viewed exclusively through Aura, a Pokémon might instead appear as a bright cloud of Pokémon-shaped energy. The sensation might feel like boundless, leaping energy.

Zero Energy, however, will make a (former) Human appear distinctively the same shape as their vessel. The less Zero Energy present will make the shape appear increasingly erratic or malformed, as if one is attempting to contain a gas in a punctured container.

**Concepts**
Types might have their own sensations or ideas associated with how a character might perceive the energy when attempting to describe them from their much more abstract forms.

### Wild and Feral
Most Pokémon are normally considered "civilized." These are the individuals who live in towns, work a job, converse with friends, and contribute to their community. Often times, they can be seen wearing a basic accessory.
- **Wild**: These are Pokémon who can still easily converse with others or even chat circles around them! However, they have decided the life surrounding a town is just not for them and prefer to live how like they've always meant to survive in this world. They might have harsher views or reactions. Overall, there is no difference between the Civilized or Wild 'mon.
- **Feral**: Compared to the previous two, a Feral is a Pokémon who is nothing but animalistic instinct. They cannot be anything less or greater than what they are. Nothing short of a Legendary intervention can change that. They defend territory and survive. That is all they can do.
- **Dungeon Feral**: While similar to a Feral, a Dungeon Feral is found exclusively within the confines of a Mystery Dungeon. They are always violently hostile and will attempt to always fight whatever they see. When they are defeated, they disintegrate and vanish from reality, returning to whatever mysterious energy spawned them in the first place. But, in special cases, a Dungeon Feral might be able to break away from this strange force and gain limited sapience. There are many records of Exploration Teams recruiting from Mystery Dungeons.

### Clothing and Accessories
Most inhabitants don't bother with clothing or serious accessorizing. However, sometimes, the climates or general culture might demand a bit of dress-up. While it may vary per area or continent, most clothing follows the simple rule that it cannot restrict movement or require a great deal of specialized tailoring.

## Smaller Details
Written ideas that help form the finer things in conversations and descriptions in writing. Daily activities, limitations, interactions, landscape, quality of life...

**Tinkatink Line and Steel-Types**
Known to require large amounts of steel to forge their impressive bludgeoning devices, the Tinkatink line has formed an interesting relationship with the Steel-Types that consist of the precious resource they seek. While they might decide to live on the outskirts of a Steel-Type village, Tinkatons often can be spotted wandering the village looking for shedding or scraps to add to their perfect hammer. Sometimes, they might even directly approach a Steel-Type and ask to barter for something that hasn't even fallen off yet! Metal feathers are heavily prized since those are the easiest to work with.
However, if there are no Steel-Types nearby, they might also exclusively work in mines, often creating a pickaxe to mine the iron themselves for their hammers. Sometimes there is a bit of both, with whole families of Tinkatons working alongside Excadrills in the underground mines near villages.

**Casting Illusions**
Particular Pokémon might have the ability to cast illusions, things some might call less than "real." Specifically, Zoroark and its regional counterpart are the only two capable of creating physical (in the sense that they have a physical presence in the world) illusions. With some minor manipulation of aura, Zoroark can create light-based illusions. As for everything else, they might deal with manipulating the mind and senses of the target to accomplish the same idea. However, they all have their limitations. Nothing as crazy as making whole forests as an illusion. Try to be reasonable with them!

**Technical Machines**
Found where Porygon make their homes, these crystalline wafers form from the electrically charged solid state stones, growing as impressive square crystal bunches. Carefully mined from the base, these flat squares are taken back to a master gemcutter, who shaves the wafer to the appropriate size before etching the spaces required to imbue the knowledge and experience of a move into the awaiting vessel. Each crafted Technical Machine resonates with a general move, and after it is imbued, cannot be etched with any other move but the one originally written on it. 
Once used, the crystals break down from the lack of charge and crumble. However, they can be taken to those who specialize in Recycling and promptly repaired. Each consecutive "Recycle" becomes harder to perform.

**Smithing and Tools**
Most creation of tools require very little knowledge of an actual smithing and smelting process, as demonstrated by the Tinkatons, they simply hammer steel together until it binds. Or they use appropriately-sized scraps from Steel-Types. This results in tools that are all unique and gnarly in their appearance, giving off a very crude manufacturing style.

**Evolution Traditions**
Some Pokémon lines, families, or even entire villages might have special rituals or traditions to perform whenever evolution is to occur.  They might be as simple as a celebration for things to come, or they might be tasked with an adventure or trial to prove their worthiness for evolution.  Gathering items, materials, or even searching for the very item that may allow their evolution to succeed. While this may not be the case everywhere, evolution can be depicted as something special to a Pokémon.

**Mythical Knowledge**
The public might not know too much about Myths and Legends, and it might just be that way all the way up until elders or historians. Otherwise, basic knowledge regarding these myths might disseminate through word of mouth or superstitions, diluted to the point the Mythical or Legendary might not even be directly referenced.
