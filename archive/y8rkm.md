- `Summary`:
	- Set in modern-day `Tokyo`.
	- The story follows the members of a `talent agency` during their conflicts with hostile beings from another world called `Mirages`.
	- `Mirages` are based on characters from `Shadow Dragon` (FE1/FE11) and `Awakening`.
	- Visit the wikis for more information:
		- https://fireemblem.fandom.com/wiki/Tokyo_Mirage_Sessions_%E2%99%AFFE
		- https://fireemblemwiki.org/wiki/Tokyo_Mirage_Sessions_%E2%99%AFFE
	- Do not consider this an FE title. This is a spin-off with some FE lore and characters. Only play this if:
		- you're a fan of `Persona` or `Shin Megami Tensei` games,
		- you're starving for `more FE` and its `characters` like Tiki,
		- you like anime.
	- `Tokyo Mirage Sessions #FE Encore` is the `Switch` version of the same game with some changes and a bit of extra content.
	- The `Wii U` version is currently the `superior` version, because the `Switch` version:
		1. is based on the international, `censored` release,
		2. `can't` be played at higher resolutions.
		- If neither of these two reasons seem important to you, then choose the `Switch` version.
	- The `Wii U` version:
		- `can` be `uncensored`,
		- `can` be played at `higher resolutions`,
		- has no `Quick Session` option to `speed up` Session attacks,
		- Barry Goodman, Tiki, and Maiko Shimazaki `can't join` in during battles to perform `Session attacks`,
		- is missing a `new dungeon`, Area of Aspiration,
		- is missing a `new song`,
		- is missing several new `costumes`.

- `Platforms`:
	- Google Android - 2017
	- Apple iOS - 2017
- `Summary`:
	- The most successful `spinoff` in the series in form of a mobile `gacha` title.
	- It’s a `hodgepodge` of characters from all FE games plus a few original characters.
	- There’s an avatar/My Unit, but their only purpose is to perform `summons`.
	- Visit the wikis for more information:
		- https://fireemblem.fandom.com/wiki/Fire_Emblem_Heroes
		- https://fireemblemwiki.org/wiki/Fire_Emblem_Heroes
	- These kinds of games are usually `very grindy` and `incentivise` spending `real` money, either for:
		- often time titilating or lewd `cosmetics`/`aesthetic` content,
		- faster `progression`.
	- There is a lot of debate on the `canonicity` of the game. To make it simple, consider Heroes to be canon within the Heroes universe for now.
	- Feel free to `skip this game`, if you're not into mobile gaming or dislike the monetization practices of gacha titles.
	- If you're still curious about the `lore` and `character dialogues`, but do not wish to `waste` your time and money:
		- search for stuff like `Supports`, `Forging Bonds`, `Story` etc.
			- look them up on `youtube`,
			- read through `wikis`.
