## Programming and Architecture

* [C Builds and Libraries for the Inexperienced](https://rentry.org/gedg-cbuild): Tutorial made for /agdg/, /chad/, and /gedg/.
* [javidx9's A* Video](https://youtu.be/icZj67PTFhc): Video about the A* path finding algorithm.
* [javidx9's Embedding Lua in C++ video](https://youtu.be/4l5HdmPoynw): Video about the Lua C API in a C++ environment. C users can also obviously learn from it. He has a follow-up video [here](https://youtu.be/E42Lyv2Ra1c) where the topic is coroutines. 
* [Programming in Lua](https://www.lua.org/pil/contents.html ): Official online book to learn Lua. Lua is great for embedding into software.
* [learn-c](https://www.learn-c.org): Collection of simple and interactive tutorials for the C programming language.
* [The Unity Tutorial For Complete Beginners](https://youtu.be/XtQMytORBmM): Tutorial to get your feet wet with Unity. 
* [Wojciech MuÅ‚a's website](http://0x80.pl/):  SIMD techniques and tons of technical notes.

## Linear Algebra and  Spacial Transformations

* [3Blue1Brown's linear algebra series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0-GT3co4r2y2YErbmuJw2L5tW4Ew2O5B): Babby's first matrix, some nice visualizations of linear algebra concepts. 
* [3Blue1Brown's quaternion visualization video](https://youtu.be/zjMuIxRvygQ): Nice video for visualizing quaternions and 3D rotations.
* [Andy Sloane's donut.c](https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html): Spinning ASCII donut written in delicious byte sized code.
* [Quaternion explanation by Nathan Vegdahl and The Blender Foundation](https://youtu.be/4mXL751ko0w): Segment in the Blender Open Movie Workshop series.

##Rendering APIs and the GPU

* [GetIntoGameDev's Vulkan playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn3eTxaOtL2NH5nbPHMK7gE07SqhcAjmk): Video series in C++ that goes through and explains concepts.
* [GPU Gems](https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/gpugems3/contributors): Nvidia's free online book containing a large variety of topics such as N-body and fluid simulation, volumetric light scattering, and AES encryption. 
* [Hash Functions for GPU Rendering](https://www.reedbeta.com/blog/hash-functions-for-gpu-rendering/): Short article by Nathan Reed.

## Noise

* [Improved Perlin Noise](https://mrl.cs.nyu.edu/~perlin/paper445.pdf):  2002 algorithm by Ken Perlin used for terrain generation. [Here](https://mrl.cs.nyu.edu/~perlin/noise/) is a Java implementation of the algorithm.
* [Noise-Based RNG](https://youtu.be/LWFzPP8ZbdU) : 2017 GDC Math for Game Programmers talk where Squirrel Eiserloh discuss how RNGs can replace noise functions. An [update of the code](http://eiserloh.net/noise/SquirrelNoise5.hpp) by Squirrel was later created.

## Fluid Simulation

* [How to write an Eulerian fluid simulator with 200 lines of code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKAVRgIrUOU) : Concise and effective fluid simulation video by Ten Minute Physics. 
* [Jamie Wong's WebGL fluid simulation](https://jamie-wong.com/2016/08/05/webgl-fluid-simulation/): Fluid simulation explained nicely with good visuals.

## General Math and Physics

The things here either don't fit in the other sections or they so largely encapsulate more than one section that putting them there wouldn't do the material justice.

* [3Blue1Brown's differential equation series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNPOjrT6KVlfJuKtYTftqH6): Rudimentary look at vector fields, ODEs, and PDEs.
