#Frequently Asked Questions

####1. Can I use my Crewmate Tickets now or should I save them for later?
Waiting until later in the game means using tickets will redeem characters at a higher level, and with more mastery points, for "free". However, leveling characters and farming mastery points becomes much easier towards the end of the game in general, so it's really up to you. Another thing to consider though is that the Terminus Weapon (every characters' BiS weapon) that drops from Proto Bahamut (the final boss of the game, in the hardest difficulty called Proud) only drops for characters you've redeemed, so consider only redeeming your favorites until you have your weapon if that's how you want to play. You can "savescum" crewmate tickets by disabling autosave, saving beforehand, using the ticket, and alt-f4ing during training to test the character. This way you can at least avoid redeeming characters you don't intend to play, and you don't have to worry about filling your possible Terminus Weapon drop pool with drops you don't care about.

####2. What are the best AI companions?
For story missions, any combination works, but for optimization, AI handles ranged units better for damage. Rackham and Eugen are best for DPS and AFK farming. For support, consider Rosetta, the Captain (Gran/Djeeta), and Cagliostro. AI's do much better at buffing, debuffing, healing and even resurrecting, than they do damage.

####3. Are Curios affected by the difficulty of the quest?
No, Curio drops are affected by the highest difficulty you've unlocked. Farm them only after unlocking Proud difficulty.

####4. Where are people farming curios?
The quest "Delts of Our Lives" (aka Goblins) is the fastest, with a 50% drop rate. To AFK farm, swap strong characters with AI, create a closed session, clear the quest once, then mark it to repeat. It takes around 10 minutes per cycle at which point it will ask if you want to continue repeating.

####5. Where and how do I farm Fortitude Crystals?
The "Shedding Light on the Pillar" Extreme quest can be AFK farmed, giving 45 M Crystals and 35 L Crystals per 4-minute run. "Revenge of the Hordes" and "Roost and Reign" Maniac quests are the fastest for active farming.

####6. Where can I farm Knickknack Vouchers?
The Extreme quest "Assault Formation" provides high-grade scrap and machine units to sell for vouchers.

####7. I can't uncap my weapon because of a missing material.
Silver Worlf Clovis, Destrudo, etc., are more easily farmed using Gold Dalia badges from Quick Quests.

####8. How to get better sigils faster?
Another version of savescumming. Unlock Transmarvel at Siero's Knickknack Shop, save 15 to 20 Transmarvels, disable autosave, save the game, then Transmarvel all of your sigils. Go to title screen and reload if the outcome is poor. After reloading, do any mission once to reset your seed or the sigils will be the same. Note that the best sigils to look for from here are the double-traited, character specific sigils that are BiS. With 20 tickets, getting two of these two-traited sigils isn't too crazy of an outcome.

####9. What weapon should I use?
Any weapon works fine throughout the game. Stinger Weapons are typically the best until your Terminus Weapon, which drops from Proto Bahamut as noted in question 1.

####10. What's Slimeblasting?
The first quest from Maniac difficulty, Slimepede, spawns Prismatic Slime dropping valuable items.

####11. Should I use Weapon Awakening on my Ascension Weapon?
Up to you, but it's a big investment that will still be inferior to the Terminus Weapon. If you can manage to defeat Proto Bahamut on Proud difficulty without Awakening your Ascension weapon, farm your Terminus instead.

####12. What's the DMG Cap? How do I know if I'm capped?
Normal hits and skills have a maximum damage. If your attack or skill shows the same number every time, you're capped. The Damage Cap sigil is the answer to this, and the trait can go up to level 65. DPS characters try to get this as high as they can. Stun power, cooldown reduction, SBA gauge and link-time related sigils seem to be the best options while you lack damage cap sigils.

####13. How many times have I played my top 3 characters specifically?
Go to co-op settings, edit profile, then switch pages.

####14. How do I change my character color?
Go to party, character details, customize character. This is where you swap between Gran and Djeeta too.

####15. What's Option Select Perfect Dodge?
You can dodge while guarding with no interruption, so if you're about to get hit by something you can hold guard then immediately dodge, making it so you dodge it if you time it right, but guard the hit if the timing is wrong.
In general, don't forget to use Guard; in this game you can block pretty much anything at least once before breaking.
