Sunburn and Kimsil double date!

--Basil's House--
Basil and Kim stood on the other side of the door. They give each other one last nod. They lace their fingers together. Basil thinks it feels nice, or at least that it'll slow his heart. Basil opens it. An elderly woman cannot see them at first.
"Grandma..."
Basil introduces his girlfriend, Kim, to his grandmother. His grandmother's eyes light up like a child, and the corners of her mouth turn up with joy.
"Oh, Basil, she's beautiful."
Kim, deciding to go all in for her friend's sake, giggles and pecks him on the cheek. It's so soft. She almost likes it.

--Eastman Hall, Collegeton--
The football player pulls roughly on Basil's hair. Basil's face is lifted off the mattress, and every powerful thrust of the player's legs into him gets a vocalization.
The player decides to finish. He signals this intention by giving Basil a hard smack on his soft little ass, collapsing on top of him, and jackhammering, pumping his thighs like an animal into the helpless bitch below him.
Basil's head is forced back into the mattress, and the player finishes while taking little bites out of his neck. Then, the strong young man collapses completely, holding his bottom still under his muscles. Basil, fucked stupid, sleepily opens his eyes, and feels strong arms wrap around him.

--4800 University Ave. Apt 122, Collegeton--
Something sweet like syrup ran through Kim's blood. The senior girl pulls the vape out of her cute little mouth to take a hit. Kim nuzzles closer into the senior's breast, and focuses on the little strokes being administered along her back. She sighs contentedly.
"I want to tell people you're my girlfriend." The senior has dropped her hand, to rub Kim's naked butt.
Kim lights up at the idea of being someone's girlfriend, and recoils at the idea of telling her old friends. Of telling Vance.
"Soon, I promise."
"What's going to change before I graduate?"
"I'm from a small town. You don't understand."
"You're so lucky you're worth hiding."
The senior puts the vape pen onto the counter, and reaches her hand around to squeeze Kim's breast. They lock eyes, and start shuffling towards a kiss.

--Gino's--
Sunny and Aubrey held hands under the table. Faraway Community College wasn't that bad, if they had each other, they explained.
Basil and Kim agreed, hands neatly folded in their laps.
Basil's anus hurt.
Kim's heart hurt. to watch a beautiful, fierce girl like Aubrey in love with someone else was worse than death.
Sunny took a bite of pizza.
Aubrey thinks he looks adorable when he eats.
