## Differences

### -> Main differences, coming from League of Legends  <- 

 - **Flash (Blink) is not 'the mandatory Active'**. Beads (Cleanse) is the most prominent active, but only on DPS Gods. Flash / Blink can only be used if the user has been out of combat for 2 seconds, primarily rendering it as a surprise-initiation tool for Junglers, and occasionally Supports. In SMITE, you catch up to targets with the plethora choices of CC *(which the target can choose to Beads (Cleanse), Aegis (Self-silencing iFrames) or Wings (Antislow+Movement))*, rather than Flashes and ever-increasing amount of ability-Dashes (which offers no counterplay from the person being chased). This in turn results in a more varied Summoner Spell / Relic metagame and more counterplay options on behalf of the victim. Supports are more freely able to take team-buffing Actives, while DPS chooses between the type of CC / damage mitigation they desire *(or, if they want to risk it, take something more aggressive)*. Additionally, **all Summoner Spells (Relics) have branching upgrades, offering different effects and lower cooldowns**.
 - **Play-regions are optional**, and you can limit players based on input method.
 - **You cannot farm under tower.** If a creep is hit by a tower shot, they lose a huge chunk of their Gold reward. You won't fall behind in levels, but you will fall behind in items. Additionally, **lasthitting exists, but isn't a priority.** Instead, you're expected to fullclear ASAP then brawl with your mirror more; boxing / skirmishing then contesting neutral farm, rather than optimising personal farm.
 - **Kills matter less, because there's more shit to do.** You don't get kills to snowball, you get kills so your mirror isn't present for when you take an objective / neutral farm, which in turn snowballs you.
 - **"Component Items" in this game do not exist, and are instead replaced by branching-upgrade system.** Rather than building minor components, you buy one item that represents a general stat you want, and upgrade twice via branching choices into the final item you want *(which, at that point offers the Item Passive you want, once 'fully built')*. This frees up a few item slots, and any item can be built at any point in the game.
 - **Boots do not exist***. Rather, you gain Passive movement between Lv1-8. This frees up another item slot.
 - **While Mythics make up the '1-per-build Super-Items' of League, SMITE's counterpart are Glyphs**, which are '1-per-build bonus Upgrades'. Glyphs are not as build-definingly powerful and offer no additional direct stat increases, but are instead a branching options for a 'Second Passive' you can grant an item, which you can choose to add to any one of the eligible items you may have. Furthermore, it's completely viable to have no glyphs in a given build, if none of the items you want are able to Upgrade into a Glyphed variant. This frees up another item slot.
 - **Starter Items have branching upgrade paths, once you hit max level for a match.** While Glyphs lack the 'impact' of Mythic items, your Starter Upgrade usually 'finishes' your build, and is the closer 'equivalent' *(even if they are lategame powerspikes, not earlygame powerspikes)*. Additionally, Starter Items can be delayed as long as you want, and if desired, can be skipped entirely to grab their Starter Upgrade at Level 20.
 - As a result of the above; **itemisation is much less limiting in SMITE**, with much more in relation to build flexibility and player choices. Even at the upper levels, there is rarely one go-to DPS build path - for example, Marksmen (Hunters) *(specifically this example, due to their notoriously stale build paths)* usually have the choice between Attack Speed and Crit build-pathing, and even when metaslaving, usually have 1-2 slots they can choose to sub out for equally beneficial items for that build.
 - **Physical and Magical is a much harder split.** While a notable amount of Champions in League can deal both Physical and Magical damage; the Gods of SMITE stick to one side, and outside of specific itemisation choices, are unable to deal split damage. Protections are hardsplit between the two damage types, but also Lifesteal and Penetration. With two exceptions *(in practical terms, one exception)*, Magical damage cannot be built for nor deal Critical damage. There is no 'Omnivamp', because no God is viably able to deal dual-damage.
 - With few exceptions, Basic Attacks are hardlimited at their respective range 'tier's - those being Melee, Spear-Melee and Projectile. **Attack Range does not exist, but is counterbalanced by (obviously) needing to aim, lead and land your shots.**

### -> Main differences, coming from DotA 2  <- 

 - **You do not lose Gold after death, and cannot buyback.**
 - Town Portal Scroll & Boots of Travel are not present, and all your **recalls are free**. There is an Active / Relic that works similar to LoL's counterpart of Summoner Spells, however it is not typically built on DPS, only allows Teleportation to Structures, only allows Teleportation to Wards once upgraded, and **does not allow teleportation to Creeps / Minions** *(so a Carry is not able to instantly splitpush with a wave that has pushed itself far; prior warding is required, and typically Teleportation is only used by the Top laner to return to lane, reinforce a teamfight or deter a Jungle Boss attempt. Exceptions exist, like Chernobog or Athena warping around the map, but for the most part)*.
 - **Couriers are not present** in SMITE - items are only purchased in your Fountain ~~or the enemy Fountain, if you don't mind the 1,000 True damage per second~~. If you really, really want a Courier however, Chang'E (Chinese Mage) comes with one as part of her Passive.
 - **Towers hit like fucking trucks earlygame**, and do not call back in the morning. Even if you have experience with LoL's slightly higher damage ramp, you do not have experience with SMITE's, which are indisputable killzones until at least one Physical Prot item is online. Phoenixes are also extremely hard to dive into without Fire Giant buff, resulting in more of a defined 'Siegeing' phase in the lategame. That said, the earlygame of SMITE has far more in terms of ganking and invasions, due to the the variable distance between Towers forcing targets to isolate themselves more, and the larger Jungle to get lost in.
 - **Minion / Jungle manipulation is less present than DotA, but still far more present than LoL.** Minion Waves hit much, much harder than both games, and unlike LoL, are willing to chase players into the Jungle. On the other hand, Jungle mobs can be pulled from out of their leash into lane.
   That said, minion manipulation in SMITE instead focuses on using them as backup while brawling with your mirror; with waveclear less about farming for a Gold advantage, and more about baiting the enemy mirror into pulling sufficient minion aggro to take chunks out of their health, and outclearing the wave to force aggro onto your mirror. Between Levels 1-4, a minion wave is reliably more dangerous than any God on the map, and they don't particularly fall off late, they simply get fullcleared faster than they can kill Gods *(with one such notorious example being that in the final stages of a game, an enhanced wave will outstall, outlive, outdamage and quickly overrun a lone Support trying to defend the Titan (Ancient / Nexus); hence requiring one damage carry to be able to clean them up if they get past the Phoenix (Barracks / Inhibitors))*.
