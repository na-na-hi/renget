# Welcome
![Picture of Chen from the Touhou series with a cup of tea](https://booru.allthefallen.moe/data/original/65/22/6522cd1d37489551de112521258fa134.jpg)

Come, have a seat[*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VS4QGEQaclk). Pour yourself some tea and relax. If you have reached this webpage, then it's likely you are an enjoyer of loli and/or shota artwork and pornography. If you're not, or don't know what these are, you may want to quietly see yourself out. My role here isn't to convert people, only to help those who have already entered the rabbit hole find their community. 

If today was the first time you rubbed one out to a cute loli or shota, you'll probably have a lot of questions. "Am I a pedophile now? Am I a bad person? Am I mentally ill?" The first question is a semantic one that I leave you to answer for yourself, but the latter two are more important. No, you are not a bad person, and you are not mentally ill. Evil comes from evil actions, and not evil thoughts. A drawing or animation of a fictional character, no matter what age they appear to be or are written as in canon, is still just a fictional character. And so long as our fantasies stay within the realm of fiction, we harm no one, and are thus still decent people (though others may not share this sentiment, so don't go shouting from the rooftops that you're a lolicon). As for whether it's a mental illness, the key elements of a mental illness require that it either causes you distress, or negatively impacts your ability to interact with society. So just don't let it leave your bedroom and don't stress about it. Everyone's got their secrets, right?

For many of you, however, this is not your first rodeo. Perhaps you've been fapping to lolis or shotas for months or even years, but you may be running out of good material. Maybe you don't know the right sites to visit to find more, or maybe the site you've been using started bringing down the banhammer on loli or shota artwork, and you need to find a new community. Or maybe you know where to find material, but you're lonely, and you need to find some like-minded people. You may have noticed that defending your interests on traditional social media is a very quick way to get yourself cancelled. 

I don't think my lolicon and shotacon brothers and sisters should be deprived of the community they need to enjoy their interest in peace. As such, I have created this guide to provide resources on where to find and share loli and shota imagery, and where you can find like-minded individuals to share your passion with. In exchange, I ask only that you stay the path of fiction and never seek to corrupt an actual minor. For most of you, this should be common sense, but there are occasionally people who develop *other* opinions. I know you're not a bad person. I just ask that you stay like that. 

# But First, You May Want to Hide Your Shit

Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer. None of this is legal advice.

If you live in Japan, where a great deal of loli and shota artwork is created, consider yourself lucky, as your legislature is quite resistant to the idea of banning loli and shota any time soon.

If you live in the US, I have good news and bad news for you. The good news is that thanks to [a supreme court decision in 2002](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/535/234/), lolicon and shotacon are considered protected speech... provided that they're not considered obscene. What's the bad news? Obscenity is pretty vague. More or less, something is obscene if an average person would consider it (a) pornographic and (b) lacking any serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. Now, personally I would consider any work that is drawn or animated to have artistic value innately, as they necessarily require artistic expression to create. And perhaps, if you have a good lawyer, you can convince a jury of this as well. But lawyers are expensive, and if you dig deep enough, you'll find instances of people giving guilty pleas to these obscenity laws. To save yourself the hassle, you may want to consider reading the rest of this section. 

Outside of the US and Japan, your situation may be worse. Some governments -- Canada being a notorious example -- consider lolicon and shotacon to be equivalent to real child pornography, and the law will punish you just the same. Additionally, even if it's not against the law for you to consume this content, you may still want to hide it from friends and family who you would prefer to stay on good terms with.

This will mean, first and foremost, hiding your web traffic. A VPN will help encrypt that traffic, and even get around any website blocks that may be imposed by your government or ISP. I'm not paid to shill any particular VPN, so I'll let you do your own research here and stress only that you should choose one that does not keep logs. On top of using a VPN, you may also want to use whatever your browser's equivalent of private mode is. Basically, don't store where you're going in your browser history, lest autocompete let a guest on your computer know what you've been up to. 

Secondly, if you are saving anything to any of your devices, you should ideally do so to an encrypted drive. For this task, I recommend [Veracrypt](https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Home.html) and nothing else. Use a strong password that is not used anywhere else, and do not let anyone know it for any reason. If you are pressed on why you have an encrypted drive, make up a reason. Say you have tax forms or something on there. Doesn't matter. You must never crack on this, because as long as that password is safe, your data can never be accessed. And if you want to be extra paranoid about it, you can create a hidden volume using Veracrypt. This means your one encrypted volume is actually two. If you are [forced to give up a password](https://xkcd.com/538/), your attacker will have access to some other volume that does not contain your cute and funny images and videos. Perhaps you might actually put your tax forms there. 

Finally, use some basic common sense about the devices you're storing your loli/shota on. I'd advise against keeping anything sketchy on your phone, since it's the most likely device that a stranger may ask to use. Furthermore, it's likely to travel with you everywhere you go, and **if you travel abroad, you should absolutely not have loli or shota on any of your devices**. Customs are a bitch, and they can search your devices. And since I know at least one idiot is going to make this mistake, **don't keep it on your work computer either**.

# An Awesome List

Enough of the introductions, this is what you came for, right? 

## Boorus

A booru is a website for hosting images (and sometimes videos) that are categorized by tags. You can search with multiple tags, and get only the images that match all of the listed tags. Depending on the site, you may also be able to search with negative tags for further filtering. An example of such a search might be `siblings incest -yaoi`, which would allow you to search for two a brother and sister going at it, but not two brothers. The following are some useful boorus that are loli/shota friendly:

* [ATF Booru](https://booru.allthefallen.moe): All the Fallen (ATF) is a website dedicated to sharing loli and shota related content. In addition to a booru, ATF also maintains a number of other services including a forum, a site for sharing stories, and a site for sharing game mods.
* [Gelbooru](https://gelbooru.com): A more general purpose booru for anime (and hentai) content. Defaults to not showing loli and shota (if you search, you'll get a message like "nobody here but us chickens"), but you can enable seeing them without an account. Go to settings, then options, then find the box labeled "display all site content". Then scroll down and click save. You'll be able to view all of the lolis on the site now.
* [Lolibooru](https://lolibooru.moe): Another decent sized booru for loli/shota conttent. Defaults to hiding nsfw content, so you may consider creating an account. If you don't want to do that, find the sidebar on the left side of the screen, click on "hidden posts", and make sure to click `rating:e` (the e is for explicit).
* [Yande.re](https://yande.re): Another general purpose booru for anime-styled content, which supports loli and shota. Similar to lolibooru in defaulting to not showing explicit content. The manner of revealing it is the same.

Content that is shared on one booru site will often be shared onto others. It is nevertheless worth knowing a few, just in case one site gets knocked down for some reason.

## Doujin Sites

Do you prefer enjoying your hentai in comic form? Here's a few sites you can go to for your kicks.

* [Exhentai](https://exhentai.org/): This site is also known as "Sad Panda", because in the past, instead of seeing a blank page when you access the site normally, you would instead see a picture of a crying panda. To access the content of the site, you need to be logged in through the forums. [Here](https://pastebin.com/n8jNJLZJ) is a simple guide from several years ago that should still work. Yes, you will have to wait a week before you can access content here, but Exhentai has been described as "The Library of Alexandria of Hentai" in the past, and it's better that you gain access to it now, rather than later, lest you have to wait a week when you want to see some hot cunny that just got linked to you. Note that this site has much, MUCH more than just loli and shota.
* [Nhentai](https://nhentai.net/): Have you ever been presented with a series of digits (typically 5 or 6) and told it's a link to something smutty? If so, you've *probably* been given an nhentai link. Here's an example: 85448. Take that, and put it after a link to nhentai in the following manner: [https://nhentai.net/g/85448](https://nhentai.net/g/85448). Or just go to [nhentai.net](https://nhentai.net) and search the number. Either way, you'll get your doujin. Nhentai, like exhentai, has a lot more than just loli and shota, but is still a decent place to go for loli and shota. Note that nhentai is not the only porn site that uses short links. Motherless is another site with a similar tradition, but its links are 7 hexadecimal digits, and it's not the type of place to go for loli or shota.
* [Hitomi](https://hitomi.la): No gimmicks, just a site with a decent number of doujins. Easy to search if you're looking for hentai of characters from a specific series.
* [DLSite](https://www.dlsite.com/index.html): Want to support your favorite doujin authors by actually purchasing their works? Try DLSite. They have hundreds of thousands of works available for purchase, which includes not just doujins, but also some games and voice/ASMR works. 

## Video Sites

Hentai video streaming services. Like pornhub, but just for hentai. 

* [Hanime](https://hanime.tv): Offers a decent selection of hentai videos, including loli and shota. 1080p requires a premium subscription, however.
* [999 Hentai](https://999hentai.net): Hentai website featuring both videos and doujins.
* [HentaiStream](https://hstream.moe/): Has hentai in 4k, and allows for searching with some blacklist filters (e.g. don't show me any NTR crap)

## Gaming

Erotic games! This section is in need of expansion. 

* [VNDB](https://vndb.org): A visual novel database. VNDB indexes thousands of visual novels, which can be searched with a large number of tags. Each entry lists the supported platforms the visual novel can be run on, the languages it has been translated into, and where it can be purchased/downloaded. Visual novels with lolicon and shotacon themes can be found here, among many others.
* [/hgg2d/ Translated Game Archive](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmTXMy42siP5jxMw7sEmyN49paZwSTmmiRDk5LYG4AsPRX/bin.html): An index of 2d hentai games maintained by an ongoing thread on 4chan's /vg/ board. Searchable with a handful of tags, and with links to purchase the game from DLSite. I have asked users in the /hgg2d/ thread how they would feel about their archive's inclusion in this document, and they have indicated that they would prefer not to be flooded with tourists. So out of respect, maybe don't pay them any unnecessary visits. **Additionally, becuase this archive is hosted on IPFS, if you find it useful, please seed it.**

## Mastodon Instances

Imagine Twitter (or X, as Musk wants to call it now), but instead of one site, it's many. And you can access the tweets of one site from another. And each of these different sites gets to have its own rules. Some of these sites are very friendly to fans of loli and shota and may be ideal if you need some sort of an outlet... or if you just want to reach out to your favorite loli artist. The following is a list of Mastodon instances that are friendly to loli and shota fans.

!!! warning Caution
    Be aware that the level of moderation on Mastodon can vary between instances. Basic Internet literacy rules apply. Watch out for scams and people trying to bait you into illegal activity over third party messaging apps. You should also read post descriptions before clicking on spoilered images, lest you see something you don't want to.

* [Pawoo](https://pawoo.net): A massive Mastodon instance based in Japan. Due to the size of its userbase, the above warning applies here especially. Note that if you are searching for loli images here, you'll want to use the ロリ tag instead of loli.
* [Mstdn.jp](https://mstdn.jp): Another massive Japanese Mastodon instance, but unlike Pawoo, doesn't block the English language loli tag. 
* [Baraag](https://baraag.net): A loli and shota friendly instance with a focus on artists. Does not tolerate certain realistic AI images, and requires all other AI images to be tagged as such.

## Altchans

Did you find this guide on 4chan? You probably did, since I tend to post it in the /b/ loli threads for the most part. Did you know there are other image boards where you can post lolis and shotas anonymously without having to deal with as much spam or bored moderators deleting threads? The following are a few sites you may consider. This section is in further need of expansion.

* [7chan](https://7chan.org): One of the older alt-chans, created in 2005 after a bunch of 4channers complained about the moderation policy. This site isn't as active as it used to be, though that doesn't necessarily mean users will approve of a buch of new posters acting like idiots and claiming to be from 4chan. Lurk before posting and you might have a good time. Notable boards are /cake/ for lolis, /sm/ for shotas, and /ss/ for straight shotacon.
* [8chan](https://8chan.moe): An image board that allows users to create their own boards. Think if reddit and 4chan had an ugly lovechild. Very slow, but it has a fair number of boards for both lolicon and shotacon. There is /loli/ for regular lolis, /delicious/ for western-styled lolis, /tot/ for toddlercon, /sm/ for shotas, and /ss/ for straight shotacon.
* [Sturdy Chan](https://sturdychan.help): A relatively small imageboard that has a unique gimmick in that you can see posts from others being typed live. There are two boards to be concerned about. /d/ is the degeneracy board, and is where you should post any pornographic material. There will always be a loli thread and a shota thread currently up, and they generally receive a handful of posts every day. /tech/ is also relevant because it is the home of the /cumg/ threads, which are dedicated to the discussion of "cooming utilities" (i.e. software that makes being a coomer a little easier).


## Other Sites

For anything that doesn't fit in a category elsewhere.

* [Pomf](https://pomf.tv): It's a loli/shota friendly livestreaming site! There aren't a *ton* of creators streaming at any given time, but if you ever wanted to watch someone draw lolis or play a game with lolis in it (perhaps with some nude loli mods), or even just watch hentai with other people, Pomf is good for that. 
* [Little Angels Hentai](https://lah.li): An old forum focused around sharing lolicon and hentai artwork. Be sure to read the rules before posting.
* [Lolisho](https://lolisho.chat): A loli and shota friendly instance of Matrix, which is an encrypted and decentralized chatting application.
* [Cute Funny Art](https://cutefunny.art): Another loli/shota friendly matrix instance, which additionally offers free cloud storage for loli artists.
* [Saucenao](https://saucenao.com): Saw a cute pic but need to know where it's from? Saucenao is a reverse image search site that indexes billions of images, including and especially anime and manga images. Most important about it is that it's not Google reverse image search. Because let's be real, you weren't seriously thinking about uploading cunny pics to Google, were you?

## Bonus! Loli/Shota Sex Dolls

Getting tired of using your hand? Want something a little more intimate than your average onahole? Good news, you don't have to resort to fucking women. For every body type that you're into, there's a sex doll for that. Depending on brand, material, and height, they can cost you around the price of a new gaming PC more or less, but provided they are well maintained, they can last for years. And what's more, they allow you to have sex with someone that couldn't exist in real life... like an anime elf loli. The following are some vendors and manufacturers that are reputable and carry sex dolls in your preferred size.

!!! note On Legality
    If you live in a country where loli images are banned, there's a good chance they have a ban on "child-like sex dolls". Jurisdictions where these bans exist often define such dolls very liberally, and have enforced said laws even when the doll appeared to simply be an adult-looking sex doll that has been scaled down. If you live in these jurisdictions, don't risk it. In the United States, there are currently no federal laws against these dolls, but there are state laws against them in Tennessee, Kentucky, Hawaii, South Dakota, Arizona, Utah, and Florida.

* [Doll Factory Photos](https://dollfactoryphotos.com/): A reputable doll vendor based in Texas that carries a large selection of sex doll brands, including many loli dolls. I highly recommend them if you are based in the US, because they maintain a number of dolls in stock in their warehouse, that can be shipped immediately to you, instead of making you wait weeks to months for a doll to be manufactured and subsequently shipped internationally.
* [Dollter](https://www.dollter.com): Another reputable doll vendor that specializes in loli and shota dolls, and will sell from a wide variety of manufacturers.
* [Kuma Doll](https://www.kumadoll.com): A doll vendor featuring a fair number of smaller dolls. Notable in that some of the dolls they stock from Mozu Doll can be purchased with their cosplay outfit. **This is very uncommon -- most dolls sold anywhere do not come with the outfit they are marketed in**. So it's worth it if you really, really want to fuck Nahida or Paimon.
* [Loli Paradise](https://loli-paradise.com): Another vendor that specializes in loli and shota dolls. Also seems to maintain a forum of sorts. 
* [Irokebijin](https://irokebijinshop.jp/): A doll manufacturer that focuses on dolls with anime aesthetics. A few of their dolls have a loli appearance, and are extremely attractive.
* [Catdoll](https://catdoll.us/): A doll manufacturer focused almost exclusively on "young"-looking dolls. They have a wide selection of said young-looking dolls, though their dolls tend to be more on the realistic side, rather than using an anime aesthetic. Some of their dolls are a little uncanny.
* [Aotume](https://www.myrobotdoll.com/collections/aotume-anime-dolls): A manufacturer focused on anime dolls, that can typically be worked with to produce dolls of a variety of customized apperances. They additionally have many existing doll patterns for various popular loli characters, such as Kanna or Anya. Note that the link here does not lead to the Aotume manufacturer's page (which is entirely in Chinese), but to a vendor that carries them and can arrange for doll customization.

# Afterword

When I published the first draft of this document, previously under the name ["Help I'm a Newbie Lolicon"](https://rentry.org/HelpImANewbieLolicon)†, I asked around for feedback on sections to add, and expansions to make on existing sections. One person recommended a conclusion of sorts. After all, this document comes with an introduction, so it only makes sense to give some sense of closure. Of course, this begs the question of what the heck to put here. I've thought about it for a while, and after a little bit of consideration, I figure the best thing to put here might be some advice. I have, after all, been an enjoyer of loli hentai (and some shota too) for well over a decade, and can say that thus far it has not had any negative effects on my ability to live life normally. Making it this far, however, requires a little bit of common sense.

First and foremost, don't beat yourself up. I've said this before, but it bears saying again for those who are still unsure: **you aren't evil**. Sure, you have different attractions than the average person, but we can't help *who* gets us hot and bothered, only *what we do* when we are. You made the choice to enjoy your attractions through the medium of fiction. No one was harmed when it was drawn or animated, or in the case of dolls and figurines, molded. No one will be harmed when you bring yourself to orgasm with them. By nearly all moral systems, you have done no wrong.

Secondly, try not to make it into your life. If you have friends and family that still love you, try and keep it that way. You probably wouldn't share with them if you had a piss kink or liked being whipped by a dominatrix, even if they'd still accept you for who you are. Everyone gets to have private lives, and this one is yours. You should do everything you can to keep it private. If you need to chat with others on a site that requires usernames, maybe use a different username there than you do on sites you share with others. Definitely don't use your real name.

Finally, do try to find some community. Even if it's just one friend who shares your interest, that's one friend you can confide in about the highs and lows you experience in your private life. Because let's be real, part of you might actually want to shout from the rooftops how much you want to marry Kisaki from Blue Archive, but if you actually did that, your neighbors might just call the cops on you. With a friend, or many friends, you can keep yourself from accidentally spilling over into your public life. Just make sure you can pick good friends.
