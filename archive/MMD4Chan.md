MMD Rentry Pastebin V1.008 - 2023
####-> About MMD <-
MMD (MikuMikuDance) is a 3D animation software. It uses a system of bones and keyframes to create animation. It runs on DirectX 9, and uses Bullet physics.
MME (MikuMikuEffects) is a plugin for MMD. It can load FX files onto models, which add effects to it.
MMM (MikuMikuMoving) is an updated alternative to MMD. It can load MMD's PMX, X, VMD, and other files, excluding PMM files. FX files may not be compatiable with MMM unless they are made for it.
