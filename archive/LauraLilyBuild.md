"Heya! I'm Laura, and this... Is my BOOM STICK!"
"Alright, I don't have a whole ad-pitch about my shotgun, but you know what I do have? A shotgun, and exactly enough knowledge to be dangerous. Specifically enough alchemy knowledge to make homebrewed ammunition, with all kinds of fun projectiles! I also have a hammerspace inventory for fast reloads, and [Relative Realism] for uh... Well, something about a 4 foot tall catgirl using a shotgun with ammo she threw together out of fantasy world ingredients seems less than foolproof. I'll take all the help I can buy, now that I'm not paying for supreme speed or luxurious death accommodations."
