##Quick pre-word
**I am updating and fixing things on this story as regularly as I remember to**
==Prologue hasn't been fixed yet, I recommend skipping it==
Main reason is that this was quite a spontaneous project so it is filled with strange sentence structure, typos, and bad formatting.
Prease understando, this is written by ESL skills.
((I recommend skipping to **Research Start** part if you don't care much about boring academy set-up))
>>TL;DR if you wanna(you should) skip to **Research Start**:
>**Anon has to do Research Project solo in a distant region because he fucked up at the Academy by forgetting his permit to the region next to school for an easy project. If he manages to finish the Research Project, he doesn't have to spend his summer at the academy grinding classes**

Hope you enjoy it nevertheless, feedback is always appreciated in /spt/

##Prologue

Anon was late for the class. He had picked the Pokemon research because it was considered the easiest course, all you basically had to do was to just read some notes and copy them and do few projects. All Anon wanted to do was to get the Academy work done and move on to other interests and hobbies in his life. After arriving to the class a bit late the teacher, Professor Gendor, gave him 'that look'. "Sorry sorry, I just woke up a bit late..." Anon apologized as he made his way to his seat, some students giggled and chuckled but most were clearly on the course for the same reason's as him. "Okay, today we will go through the Southern region's weather and how it affects Pokemon's nesting habits. How many of you know which Pokemon prefers the dry weather the most? For example..." 
Anon was just daydreaming most of the class, passively writing down what was needed for future tests. It was only two more months and he was done with the Academy, then he can go and... 
The bell rang, everyone starterted to pack their bags and chatting with each other as Gendor spoke "Alright class. That's all for today. Remember to get ready for the the week long on-site Research Project. The Academy will give you all the supplies from the Warehouse side of the Academy so remember to take your permit there before evening."
Yeah yeah, the Research Project...  Wait, what project? Anon's eyes widened. Oh yeah, *that* project. He was supposed to bring his permit... A week ago. Anon shot up and ran to the teacher. "Professor, I... Forgot to bring my permit for you! I want the area next to the Academy please!" Gendor sighed, shaking his head. "Anon... Yesterday was the last day to bring it in. We had constant reminders for it, how on earth did you forget?" The Teacher asked, sitting down on his chair and going through the papers. Some star students giggled as Anon was utterly embarrassed. The teacher quickly motioned them to go away, leaving him with Anon alone in the classroom.

"Anon" Gendor started as he went through his papers, finding the Research Project plans "You do know trying to get the easiest spot this late is basically impossible? I know that you, and many others, are here to just get the easy points for your certificate. Still, I cannot let all of the students go sit next to the Academy to stare at Bidoofs and Pidgeys. That is why we have multiple locations and limit on how many students can be on same area." Anon tried to speak but the Professor continued. "And that is because otherwise we would have 3 students writing actual reports and rest copying them. That is why I often assign maximum of 3 students in one area, if they work together that is great, and if they go solo we get multiple different views in one site." Anon had heard this before and it all was coming back to him. It was the thing that was first discussed when the Research Project was discussed two months ago. "So. I'll be honest. I shouldn't let anyone to join project this late, and especially any region that has any other students as they have had planned their permits together. Actually it is against the Academy's guidelines to even assign you to the project..."
Anon's heart dropped. He was looking blankly down a the desk. "...Can I still pass the Pokemon Research course?" Anon asked carefully, looking back at Professor Gendor, who in turn sighed. "Haah... To be frank Anon, while you have done your homework, you are textbook B student. You haven't really done anything extra so you are so-and-so on passing the course without this project. You could always stay after the semester for a month of extra studies and classes during summer with people who needs to repeat classes..." Anon almost fell to his knees. No fucking way, month of school? "...However..." The teacher cleared his throat. "I really don't want to keep anyone here more than necessary and understand you want to get this done as quickly as possible, right?" Anon nodded excited. Maybe there was a way out of this. "Okay, listen closesly..."

"There are three regions that nobody has picked at all. Desert region that we just talked about this class." Anon had a blank face but nodded. "...Could you even pretend you listened during class." Gendor sighed and shook his head before pointing the region on the map he had on his desk. "I would recommend it, but it has also **quite hot weather right now**. Still, you could easily go through it and there is no need to write much - In fact there are just mainly Silicobras and Sandiles there during this time of the year." Anon was about to talk "Yes, I know it is silly for me to tell you already what to find from there and what to expect defeating the whole projects. I just want to be clear with you and help you get through this class. You might find something different as well but I really doubt it." Anon nodded, letting the Professor continue
"The next region would **northern snow region**." Gendor pointed the location on the map. "I wouldn't recommend it because you have more work there and while weather there is nice this time of the year it can still be cold if you aren't used to it. If you get just few interesting pictures of Pokemon we can call it done case." Anon looked at the map, it was quite up north. "You still would get good camping gear and they are quite warm during even the coldest winter months, I have tried them myself. Even the tents are quite big and warm, but still light. That's technology for you." Gendor laughed a bit, which Anon returned with a slight awkward laugh of his own. "So, go there if you want. And the last one is... Well..."
The Professor pointed at **wide open sea on the map**, there was a small island dot that he could make out just barely from under the Professor's finger.. Anon looked at the map, then the Professor. "...I can't swim that far" Anon said as a small joke, making Gendor laugh. "Ahaha, of course you don't go there like that. We'll get you with plane to the closest island and you can rent either Academy's boat or water Pokemon to study the area better. But you'll get to swim a lot in warm seawater." Anon liked the sound of that. "You might wonder why that is open still, right? Well the truth is that you have to deal a lot with Tentacruel's and other poisonous Pokemon. And many don't like that. Also if you aren't a good swimmer you might not get much done and... Yeah. That won't get you pass the course." Gendor returned to his papers.
"So, usually I would give you more time to decide but I can make the permit quickly right now and take blame for 'forgetting' it. You could always just do the summer classes." Gendor assured Anon, catching Anon by surprise. "Is it really okay if you take the blame? Like I don't know if..." "It is fine." Teacher interrupted Anon. "But you decide. Preferably now." Anon thought hard for a while. Three hard choices for him. Be it the **Hot Desert**, **Cold Icy North**. or **Middle of a warm tropical sea**.
Anon made up his mind.
...
"Are you sure? It isn't cold up there but it can still be chilly at nights."
Professor asked with a slight concern in his voice. Anon gave a nod, determined look on his face. With a small sigh, Professor picked up his pen and quickly wrote the permit for Anon, handing it over to him.
"Okay, now go and take this to the Warehouse manager. Preferably before the schoolday ends."
Anon bowed giving a hasty thanks to the Professor Gendor before running off. 
"...I'm sure he'll be fine."

##Research start

**Day 1: Arrival**
After a few hour flight, Anon arrived to the small town in the snowy region. The air wasn't as cold as he feared it would be, just around -5Â°C. The Academy winter clothing was more than enough to keep the cold off of him so that was a small relief at least. Anon decided that he should go first to Pokemart to get some food for his week long research trip. After that he looked at the town map, showing mainly the attractions around the town, most of them being small 'experiences' for tourists.
"So north is the most remote area when it comes to population..."
Everything north from the town was just labeled **Wilderness**. Nodding to himself, Anon started heading towards north, away from tourists and locals, only small rugged path was there to guide him, but even that ended after just few minutes, leaving civilization behind.

He had been walking for few hours before he started finding wild Pokemon. Snorunt was his first discovery.
"Oh right, I should take a picture with the camera I got..." He dropped his backpack in the snow, rummaging through the pockets to pull out the camera he got from Academy. "Alright, let's see how this works again."

It didn't have any kind of internet connection and could only upload pictures at Academy. Mainly made so students couldn't cheat by sharing pictures with each other. After messing around with the Camera's settings, he took few pictures of the Snorunt who just stared back at him confused. Before long, more Smorunts gathered around Anon, giving him the same kind of confused looks. He was caught off-guard by their curiosity, never guessing wild Pokemon here would be approaching a random human. Of course if it was a major city one could even expect that kind of behavior, but here in such a remote place it felt a bit strange. Looking at the waddling Snorunts it didn't take him long to get an idea.
"Oh, I should go back to the town and buy some Pokeballs so I could cat-" He didn't manage to finish his thought process before remembering the Professor's words.

"This isn't a collection trip, this Project is for studying Pokemon, not battling or catching them. If we find even one caught Pokemon on you when you come back, you will be failing the class and most likely get detention. Understood?" Anon sighed "*Yes teacher*" to himself. Snorunt would be cool, especially if he got his hands on a Dawn Stone. Froslass is pretty cute and beautiful afterall. At least he could hope he'll see some while being here, and maybe come back after the Research Project and catch a Snorunt of his own. After taking few more pics of Snorunts, he decided to walk deeper into the wilderness while typing small notes about Snorunts and their exciting lifestyles.

"...It's quite quiet around here." Anon thought to himself as he looked around. "Didn't think that just after walk this short it would be so peaceful..." He didn't even spot any old buildings or structures while going deeper into the forest, the whole area seemed to be just pure wilderness. It didn't take too long for Anon to find a good flat area for his tent. There was even a convinient treestump where he could sit on if he wanted to be outside. He started setting up his tent, it was mostly automatic set-up process so it was up quite quickly. He also found out that the Professor was right, it was huge on the inside. You could easily fit two people there, and it was warm too.
"Hey, this doesn't seem that bad afterall. Dunno why he warned me so much about this specifically..." Anon wondered while getting his backpack inside the tent as well. "I can't even imagine what it would be like to be in the desert heat..." Just the thought of having to be a week straight in sandy dunes to stare at Silicobras made him thirsty. "Oh yeah, I haven't eaten much yet..."

Anon decided to boil some noodles while checking out the Research Project instructions, he hadn't checked them out yet afterall. He sat down on the treestump and browsed through the small document pile he got from the Academy.
"Okay, so I'll just get pics of few more mons... Write down something about each one... Their size and habitat... What they eat... Be dangerous about approaching aggressive Pokemon..." He mumbled to himself while waiting for the camping stove to heat up.
He kept shifting through the papers filled with some boring history lessons until he got to the *important* part of the instructions. There were guidelines on what to do first when going to a different region as the Academy student
"Oh... I was supposed to register at the Pokemon Center that I had arrived..." Anon sighed.
He looked up, it started getting dark again as the orange hue from setting sun colored the horizon in the distance. He arrived quite late with his flight, earlier tickets had been sold out already and he was lucky to even get one today.

"Well it says that 'remember to register at Pokemon Center during your trip' so I guess I can do it tomorrow"
The idea of walking back tomorrow alread sounded quite bothersome and pointless to him. Anon kept thinking about it before coming back to his senses. The water was boiling already. He threw the noodles in with some spices that came with the package and started stirring them slowly.
He let out another sigh, this wasn't the best start for the trip. "...I guess I could go register in few days after I get some photos. Might as well do this on 
one-go while I'm here." It wasn't a half-bad idea in his mind, afterall it would be just easier and less work than to walk back and forth right away. Well 

Anon started eating his noodles, listening to the quiet wind blow and snow piles dropping from the trees from time to time.
"...?" He was sure that he heard sounds behind the trees, but he didn't see anything there. Maybe there are a bit more timid wild Pokemons out there. "Would make it easier if every Pokemon were like the Snorunts I met... Well, I'm sure I'll spot some Swinubs and Sneasels tomorrow." Anon finished his noodle lunch before getting in his tent, crawling inside his sleeping bag as the evening turned into a night. He made some more notes about Snorunts before running out of things to write. He checked his phone as well, the signal was quite bad, it barely managed to point out the approximated area he was on. Anon let out a small sigh, but at least he remembers the direction he came from so it wouldn't be hard to find his way back. Afterall he had good sense of direction. Before long, Anon fell asleep inside the comfy sleeping bag, listening to the sounds of the quiet nature.

**Day 2: Paw prints**
The morning light shining through the tent and on sleeping Anon's face. He wakes up, blinking his eyes before sitting up and looking around a bit confused. It takes him a while before remembering where he is
"Oh yeah... The Research Project..." He stretched a bit, it's quite warm inside the tent but he puts his clothes on before looking at the thicker winter clothes. He decides to put the warm winter boots, wanting to just check how cold it is outside. As he got out of his warm tent, the chilly morning air hit his skin. It didn't feel as cold as he feared, but more than all it was surprisingly refreshing. Anon inhaled the fresh air before letting out a pleased sigh, stretching his arms and back a bit.
"Mmh... Hey, this isn't half bad, Nothing like waking up in middle of a quiet forest. Air is clean and refreshing too." It was pretty nice, week of freedom from the Academy's classes and civilization. It filled him with almost primalistic satisfaction, man on his own in middle of the wilderness. Just like things should be.

"Let's see... I should get some breakfast... Then go search maybe to west or east to see if I spot some Swinubs or someth-" His sentence got cut short as he looked down at his feet. He had no idea how he didn't notice them before. Massive paw prints all around the tent. They weren't there when he set up, that was for sure. Some huge Pokemon had been observing his tent while he was asleep. His manly thoughts of being alone in the wilderness suddenly turned into animalistic fear. Only one Pokemon came to his mind.
"B-Beartic...!?" He went into panic mode, jumping inside his warm tent. "Okay... Okay. Beartics are ferocious and aggressive..." Anon whispered to himself while getting his phone from the tent just to confirm it was a Beartic. Snapping a pic with his phone, he compared it to the Academy's database that he had on his phone:
-> *Result: Glaceon* <-
"...What? Was it from a bad angle?"
He took another pic, steadying his hands:
-> *Result: Glaceon* <-
He went to another paw print and made sure to take as clear of a pic he could:
-> **Result: Glaceon** <-
He searched for the biggest Glaceon paw print that had been recorded in the Academy's database.
Alpha Glaceon's Paw Print was just 1/4th of the ones around his tent.
"Okay, someone is messing with me. Are the Snorunts using massive paw stilts or something?" Anon muttered to himself, more confused than afraid at this point.
He went inside his tent again to put his winter clothes on in addrenaline filled rush. "This isn't normal... According to just the paw size the Glaceon would be fucking bigger than me. How on earth didn't I hear it...?" He was packing his stuff up, munching on some ready-made sandvich from the store so he could run away from the huge never seen Glace-

"...Wait." Anon stopped, before packing up his tent. "...If I get a pic of that huge Glaceon or whatever it is, I'll get S+ or something like that."
He sat down on a treestump next to where his tent was, finishing his sandvich. "And if it wanted to eat me, I wouldn't be awake right now..."
The idea of Beartic-sized Pokemon just attacking and eating him in the middle of the night made him feel a bit ill. Anon gazed back at the paw prints in the snow, He pinched his own cheek. "Ow... Okay, this isn't a dream..."
He was still filled with addrenaline, full of confidence. The idea of finding a biggest Glaceon ever seen made him excited. He would be recorded in the historybooks forever, and while he never wanted to become any kind of Pokemon researcher the idea of it didn't sound half bad. Maybe he even could become a Professor.
"Anon, the Northern Researcher..." He said quietly to himself, looking at the paw prints leading away from the camp. Nodding to himself he got up, packing rest of his stuff before following the paw prints that led him deeper north.

Following the paw prints, Anon walked through the deepening snow. Some Cubchoos looked at him from behind the trees to his side. "Oh, I guess take few pictures of them before..."
He noticed a Beartic walking to, supposedly to it's, Cubchoo babies. The huge bear Pokemon let out a low bark-like sound as it got in front of it's cubs. Anon looked away, picking up pace to follow the paw prints. "...Or maybe not." He glanced back nervously, but seeing the bear family walk deeper into the forest made him let out a small sigh of relief.
"Well, when I get the pic of whatever is making these paw prints, I'll become a legendary researcher, no need for normal Pokemon like that." Anon laughed at himself almost manically while rushing through the snow.
It took more than two hours, but with the power of addrenaline it felt just like a flash for Anon. He made it to a steeper hill, climbing on top of it a bit shakily and breathing heavily. Looking down from the hill, he saw the paw prints go under a tree just a stone's throw away where the culprit was sleeping.

A huge Glaceon. Back at his camp he wondered if it was bigger than him, and he was right. It was **at least twice as big as him.**
"No fucking way..." Anon managed to say between his heavy breath, trying to calm himself down. "I'll just take a pic, it'll be all I need for it. I don't even need to put any different sett-" As he tried to reach for his camera, he realized that it wasn't in his pocket.
"Ah fuck..." Anon instantly remembered, he stuffed it in his backpack in a hurry when he was going to leave before. He quickly dropped his backpack in the snow, taking his gloves off and rummaging through it as he tried to find his camera. "Come on...!"
After a good minute of rummaging and glancing restlessly at the sleeping Glaceon, "...! There!" He managed find it in one of the backpack's many pockets. He grabbed the camera and pointed it towards the huge Glaceon. 
Anon froze up, shivers going through his body.

The Glaceon was staring at him straight in the eyes. It felt intense, making his heart beat faster and faster. He almost passed out from feeling light-headed before managing to steady himself.
"W-What the hell was that...?" Anon asked confused before shaking his head, clearing his mind and focusing again.
He took a deep breath, pointed the camera properly towards the Glaceon and snapped a pic. But just before he managed to take one, the huge Glaceon swiftly jumped to the side.
"Ah fuck, stay still!" Anon tried to follow the Glaceon, falling down the hill as his legs suddenly gave out. He rolled down the hill, thankfully it wasn't that steep and just after few seconds of rolling in the snow, Anon got up. He managed to hold the camera in his hand, and as he pointed it to take several pics the Glaceon was running away back towards Anon.
"Stop! Don't go...!" Anon yelled out, almost begging desperately for the huge ice Pokemon to stop and come back to him. But it was useless, Glaceon just darted with lightning-fast speed behind another hill and vanished from his sight.
Anon fell on his knees, panting heavily. "Haah... D-Did I get a pic...?" He asked and looked down at the camera to browse his photos.

Scrolling first through the Snorunt pics, he got to the Glaceon ones.
First pic had a blurry light-blue blob jumping to the side out of the frame. "This is just Smash leak material if anything..."
The next few pics were just blurry photos of Glaceon's butt. The scale was off and it looked like it was just zoomed. Rest of the pics were just snow and some trees in the distance making it impossible to get any real sense of the Glaceon's size.
"Come on..." Desperately Anon started looking for the Glaceon's paw prints. "I-If I take a pic of the Glaceon's paw print compared to my hand..." He started crawling through the snow to the closest fresh paw prints. Anon put his hand next to it in the snow, snapping five pics in row before realizing how stupid he looked.
"...What am I even doing...?" The exhaustion started buidling on him, and Anon almost fell face flat on the snow. Like anyone couldn't just fake a paw print, in snow. 'look I have pics of blurry blob and Glaceon's ass, look at these huge paw prints too!' He thought to himself. If anything, he would get laughed off and get strange looks from everyone after showing Poke butts to the Professor and the class.

Sighing, he managed to lift himself from the snow and made his way back on top of the hill, to his backpack. The addrenaline rush was dying down hard and he felt it in his body, the two hour fast paced walking was coming back at him with constant grinding pain. Feeling light-headed as well, he just tried his best to walk up the small hill which felt like climbing the Spear Pillar.
"I-I might have overdone it... I gotta... Rest..." He got to his backpack, leaning against it. It just felt like he could sleep any moment now...
But something inside Anon made his eyes go wide open. Be it something primal or something... New, it didn't let him fall asleep in middle of the snow. There were some Beartics and even a Cetitan looking at him from down where the Glaceon was resting at.
"I can't sleep now... I'll die..." He panted heavily, getting the backpack on as he went down the hill back where came from, towards his camping site

It was an atrocious long walk back to his camp. Taking much longer than when going to the Glaceon. Thankfully it didn't snow at all, so he could follow his own footsteps back with no trouble. He managed to force himself to walk back all the way, leaning against the trees along the way for small breaks. He was afraid to sit down in fear of suddenly falling asleep. Finally after multiple hour of walking in the snow, the familiar opening with a treestump was visible. Anon almost laughed between his shaky panting as he sat down, letting his tent set-up in front of him.
The instant it was up, Anon crawled inside the tent and started clumsily pull out the sleeping bag while kicking his clothes off. It was so pleasantly warm and safe. But the feeling of warmth and safety was slowly washed over by frustration as he looked at his camera.
He looked through his photos, the blurry jumping Glaceon... Several blurry pics of the Glaceon's behind... "Wait."
One of them came out better that the rest. "It's quite clear... You can even make out the fur and-" Anon very quickly noticed that the Glaceon was female. He zoomed in, curious about how it looked.

"It looks quite... Human..." Anon was blushed a bit as He looked at the Glaceon's butt more... Staring it. He swallowed. Maybe it was the sudden warmth, maybe it was the loneliness, but his downstairs was stiff as a metal rod.
"...Oh come on. I'm not that lonely" Anon rolled his eyes before looking at the photo again. Glaceon's plump rump clear and visible, the inviting anus between the thick chee-
"Okay, that's enough..." His cheeks bright red, Anon puts the camera away. His member keeps throbbing from just the idea of seeing Glaceon's butt again. "...Maybe I should look at some porn" Anon said before remembering the poor signal. He sighed, trying to make his member calm down a bit by thinking about other stuff. Thankfully the exhaustion and tiredness helped him to get the lewd thoughts out of his head. It was just barely evening as Anon fell asleep inside his warm sleeping bag, protected by his tent.

**Night 2: Visit**
Anon wakes up, slowly opening his eyes. "..." It's dark, but he can see the roof of his tent. His body still feels heavy from yesterday's long walk.
"...What time it is?" Anon groans weakly on the ground while clawing the tent floor for his phone for a while. He finally finds it next to his head and turns on the bright screen. 1:38am.
Anon sighs, holding his forearm over his face after placing the phone down. "Well there goes my sleep rhythm, back to NEET mode then..." He sat up, trying to get out to look around before his legs reminded him again about the yesterday's long walk. "Dammit..." Anon decided to lie back down, feeling his calves tense up as he tried to stretch a bit. It hurt, but felt kinda good at the same time.
Not knowing what to do as he wasn't feeling sleepy, he picked up his camera again, browsing through the photos he got yesterday. The blurry images of the huge Glaceon made him frustrated again. "I just needed on good pic... Should I just get some professionals to get pic of her...?"
He remembers how the Glaceon stared at him, it's eyes staring deep into his mind. Anon felt a bit light-headed again, the image of Glaceon's stare being so intimidating, dominating, and... Beautiful? Before he knew it, he was looking at the clearer pic of Glaceon's rump.
It was much bigger than his head and indecent thoughts started filling his mind. Anon felt his dick begging for attention again. "Huh...? Oh right..." He shook his head, placing the camera down and taking his phone again.
"I guess I haven't fapped in a while. Might as well..." Casually Anon opened the internet. The signal was bad, and the porn site failed to load multiple times in a row. "...I guess I have some videos saved locally, even when they have gotten quite boring already." He opened the sleeping bag a bit to make handwork easier, and just before he managed to start, he heard noises outside.
"...?" It was still bit far away, but was moving towards him. The pace didn't sound like a human walking towards him, it wasn't heavy either... "...It's not bipedal..." Anon thought to himself.
Suddenly a thought came to his mind. One Pokemon visited him last night. "...Could it be...!?"

Anon carefully put his phone down and picked up his camera in return, still lying down. He quietly adjusted the camera settings turning the flash on so he could get a proper photo, it was quite dark afterall. The creature outside got closer, it walked behind the tent and Anon could hear it's gentle breathing. The light that moon in the sky casted down formed a shadow of the creature against the barely transparent tent. It was the huge Glaceon, almost the size of the tent itself.
Anon was dead quiet, not moving an inch as the huge Alpha Glaceon kept walking around the tent. His mind kept forming a plan, neurons going overdrive. "I'll jump out after it goes past the front. I kneel down steadily and focus, taking a pic of the Glaceon that looks at me surprised..."
Anon listened the Glaceon walk to the front of his tent. "The snow will be cold. My legs hurt but I can make it... I can make it if I expect it to hurt and be cold..." Anon said to himself inside his head, preparing both his mind and body for the sudden dash he was going to do when opportunity arrived.
Still lying down and not wanting to move unless necessary, he waited for the Glaceon to move away or to the other side of his tent. "..."
Anon waited. "..."
And waited. "..."
It was already two minutes of complete silence, Anon could hear some Noctowls in the distance The Glaceon hasn't moved at all.
"...?" Suddenly a noise, the Pokemon was opening the zipper to the tent.
"???" Anon wasn't prepared for this at all, his hands were shaking while gripping on the camera. His mind had went over multiple scenarios idea but this wasn't one of them. He had no idea what was going to happen.
As the zipper was pulled up completely, he could see the Glaceon's chest fur a bit before...

The Glaceon pushed it's huge head inside, staring Anon intensively. It was a familiar stare. Anon's whole body started shaking, his cock throbbing intensively as he panted heavily. The Glaceon looked down at Anon's free throbbing cock, then back at him.
"...?" The huge Glaceon leaned forward a bit and gave a long sloppy lick to Anon's crotch while keeping an eye contact with him. "AHHH!" Anon yelped pit, jumping a bit and taking a pic of the Glaceon. The bright flash made the Glaceon's eyes wide open, and it backed out with a switft jump.
Meanwhile Anon was shaking, his own eyes wide open as well. He heard the Glaceon's running get farther and farther away, until the only audible thing he could hear was his own shaky breath.
"What the hell was... Hey, wait!" Anon tried to sit up before realizing that his legs in fact weren't ready to move. Still, his upper body kept trying to get after Glaceon. He had to get to her, he just had to. "I-I need to..." He shook his head. "I need to get the pic... Fu..."
But he couldn't get up, instead falling back. "What is even going on anymore...? Wait...? Did I get a pick of it!?" Anon excitedly browsed through the photos on his camera before he found the newest one. "...! I got one! Fina-" His face turned as red as Tamato berry.

The photo had Glaceon staring at the camera, licking Anon's throbbing pre-cum leaking dick. Even the look on Glaceon's face was lewd, intense as it stared at Anon. Like demanding something from him... He had to get to her so... He could get a proper pic of her.
He shook his head. All in all, it looked like some black market POV Pokephilia porn with it's overly bright camera flash.
"OH COME ON! LIKE I CAN SHOW THIS TO ANYONE IN THE FUCKING ACADEMY!" Anon yelled in frustration, covering his face with his both hands as he dropped the camera on his chest.
He was in complete disbelief. Why would a Pokemon do something like that voluntarily? Why all pics he had of the Glaceon were it licking his cock or clear photo about it's sexy plump bu-
"What...?" He said quietly when the thought of Glaceon's butt kept constantly invading his mind. Anon again felt his cock throbbing. It was covered in the Glaceon's saliva, it felt wet and warm.
"I'm not a Pokefucker..." Anon looked at the camera, Glaceon's... Commanding eyes staring at him. He tried to close his eyes but his mind was filled with images of Glaceon's huge butt and how Glaceon would make him cum in an insta- "..."

Anon started masturbating, trying his best to think about anything else. But it was pointless, he couldn't stop thinking about it. How she... The Glaceon stared at him. He picked up the camera, switching between the pics of Glaceon staring at him, and the pic of it's butt. Anon even deleted the pics in between them so he could switch from one to another quickly in turns.
He came in just two minutes, it felt good, intense. Anon even moaned out loud, something he doesn't normally do when masturbating or cumming. He dropped the camera on his side, in disbelief that he just masturbated to a feral Pokemon.
"What..." He tried to push it away, wanting to forget it. "It's just an exception... Nothing more. I just got horny... Haven't fapped in a while... Hahaha" Anon laughed to himself. "It's just the isolation that is getting to me. I'll just sleep and continue tomorrow. Maybe I'll head back..."
He closed his eyes, feeling quite peaceful as he drifted into a warm comfortable sleep.


**Day 3: Chase**
Anon woke up, it was already bright outside.
"Huh...?" He picked up his phone, it was 11:48am. "Oh, I slept quite long..." He muttered to himself as he sat up, feeling surprisingly refreshed after a long sleep.
As he sat up to take a look outside, he noticed that his legs didn't hurt. They felt a bit sore, but it didn't feel bad to move them around. "Huh... Strange. I guess I'm in a better shape than I thought?" Anon then noticed his crotch. It was covered in dried up cum. "...Maybe I overdid it? I remember doing it only once though..."
Thinking he just had normal wet dreams, he took his underwear off and decided to wash them with some water later if he found a river. Taking a cleaner pair of underwear and putting them on, his stomach reminded him that he hadn't eaten anything.
"Oh yeah... I haven't eaten anything since last morning..." He put outdoor gear on and decided to get some fresh air while eating his canned food.

Anon saw the Glaceon's paw prints around the tent, and the ones a bit farther away after it ran away.
"Should I just go back and ask for a professional team to get photos and research on her...?" His head hurt from thinking that. It felt wrong letting others close to the Glaceon. He felt like he should be the one... No, Anon **knows** that he is the one who should get more pics of the Glaceon.
"...Maybe I could get some better pics if I prepared properly?" He started searching some basic tips for photography while eating his breakfast dry breakfast, finishing off with some water.
"I see... Let's keep the camera in my pocket... It should fit in my jacket's pockets..." After reading a bit more about photography, Anon decided to move out to chase the Glaceon once again. He packed his tent and everything in a proper order, making sure he had everything with him.
"Okay... Like this...?" He knelt down, pulling out his camera in quick fashion. It felt good, even when doing it in middle of the woods alone must have seemed silly. "This time for real. No more blurry or... That kind of pictures."
Anon shaked his head, this time he was determined, and after some stretching, he took his backpack and headed towards west after the paw prints.
It was time for Anon to get a good photo of a Glaceon.

Anon walked through the quiet wilderness, following the Glaceon's paw prints like yesterday. There weren't many Pokemon around, only few Snorunts that kept looking at him curiously. Some even followed him a bit before getting bored and waddling away.
"Those Snorunts are strange... All other Pokemon are avoiding me. Well all but one..." He sighed, and kept walking.
After an hour of following the prints he noticed that they led him under a tree with a noticable dent on the snow. There were more paw prints that went to other way,they were much more fresh and cleaner compared to ones that he had been following.
"It must have slept here... Maybe it just woke up? Maybe I woke up the same time as she did?" It was a strange logic, but for some reason it made sense to Anon. He just knew he had a right hunch, something inside his head was telling him that. Well, it didn't matter to Anon, all he had to do was to follow the paw prints and see if he could find her.

The Glaceon had been going around the forest, but Anon was lucky. It had been stopping to eat few times from the berry bushes around the forest so he was catching up to her if he kept up his pace.
After a while, getting out of the forested area, Anon caught a glimpse of the Glaceon farther away. It was walking in quite a slow pace, disappearing behind a hill.
"Yes... There she is..." Anon said quietly to himself as he picked up the pace for a small distance, just to slow down a bit after he got to the hill Glaceon went over. He dropped his backpack carefully in the snow and readied his camera, thinking over and over again how he should get the picture.
"Okay... And kneel down for better stability..." Few more steps and Anon rushed forward, lowering himself on his knee to get a perfect shot of the Glaceon

The huge Glaceon had lowered it's head against the ground, it's legs were spread apart as it swayed it's huge butt to Anon. The massive Glaceon had intense look on it's face, staring Anon. "Did it notice me following it?" Frustrated from not getting a good angle, Anon tried to move to the sid-
-> **Take a photo of it** <-
"Anon turned to face the Glaceon's butt, snapping pictures of it as the Glaceon kept shaking it's plump rump to him. "Ah... Wrong angle...!" Anon blushed, frustrated. Why did he take pics like that? He was supposed to take this seriously.
"Anyway! If I get to it's side, I might get a better view of it's bod-"
-> **You need more photos of it** <-
Anon froze in place, facing the Glaceon's butt again. It was swaying from side to side so seductively. Anon couldn't get enough of it, he needed to get more pics of it and maybe even bury his face against that lovely... "!?" He realized that he was taking pics of her butt again, zooming on it. He closed his eyes, desperately dashing to the Glaceon's side.
The icy Pokemon in turn let out a pleased purr before dashing away from where Anon came from. "Hey! Stop messing with me you...!" Anon dashed towards her, trying to catch up. As he saw the Glaceon again, he started taking photos. "Gotcha...!"
The Glaceon darted between the trees as Anon tried to get photos of it. It was way too fast for something that big, and just in few second it disappeared in the forest. Anon fell on his knees once again, breathing heavily.
"What is wrong with that Glaceon...?" He looked at the photos he took. "Ah, when did I delete the Snorunt photos...?" They were gone, but photos from the second day and night were still there. Anon quickly browsed past them. no time for that, better to see the newer proper phot-

All he had were close ups of the Glaceon's seductive butt. There was one photo where the Glaceon was staring at Anon, intense look on it's face again. It made Anon feel light-headed once again. "Why... Didn't I get any...?" Confused, he went past the ten or so photos of the Glaceon's butt only to find the pics he just took while she was running away.
Another collection of blurry dashing light-blue blurs. This time partly covered by trees.
"Come on... Why...?" Anon just fell on his back, frustrated and felt like screaming from anger. Few Snorunts gathered around him, probably wondering why he was lying there.
"Don't you judge me... Go on and take better pics of the Glaceon if you are so good." Snorunts just looked at each other confused before waddling away. Letting out a sigh, Anon got up and walked back to his backpack, getting ready to leave.
"Wait." He said aloud, gripping the backpack tightly, looking at the forest where the Glaceon ran into. "I'm not gonna go back. I'm gonna catch up to it again!" Anon said determined, lifting the backpack and putting the camera into his pocket.
"I'm gonna find you... And I'm gonna..." He shook his head, why is he getting that kind of thoughts all the time? Nevertheless, he decided to march after the Glaceon.

After walking for another hour, he made his way to a bottom of massive cliff. It was almost 90 degree angle straight up and there were some paw prints on it leading up. It was way too high, like climbing a skyscraper.
Still the Glaceon had climbed it, clearly with relative ease on top of that.
Anon tried his best to follow the Glaceon's steps, barely getting anywhere before falling down in the soft snow. He kept staring up.
"How can this be so hard? All I want is one photo of my Queen..." He whispered in longing tone before realizing what he said. He slapped his face few times and sat up.
"...I'll head back to the camp and make some notes." Anon said quietly, trying his best to not get angry or just plain out scream in frustration.
He did punch few trees on his way back.
After two hour of walking, he made it back to his camping spot and started setting the tent up once again. He sat down on the treestump, face covered in his hands as he managed to calm down.
"Haah... You know, I'll make some notes... Might as well." He started writing, looking at the Research Project documents for some pointers on what he should note.
 "Size... Huge. Much bigger than normal Alpha Glaceon... Twice the size of a human... Fast as Doduo... Agile... Can climb steep cliffs easily..." He muttered to himself while writing the notes. "Build... Quadruped with hips wider than my shoulders... Has seductive look... Human-like genitals... Female... Thanks to it's size, I could easily bury my head between it's plump cheeks eas-" His cheeks went bright red as he stared at what he wrote.
"What the hell am I writing?" He deleted it quickly, going back to write about the region and the berry bushes the Glaceon probably ate from.

Anon ate some more canned food, sitting inside his tent while looking at this phone. It's already 3rd day, he still hadn't registered at the Pokemon center and wasn't making any progress.
"Maybe I should get few pictures of other Pokemon... And then ask a professional team go after my... After the Glace-" His head hurt again. He didn't want that. It just wasn't right for others to serve... Anon shaked his head, starting at his phone and trying to clear his mind.
"I-If I leave tomorrow, I might not find Glaceon again..." He told himself, even when he knew he should get help. But he didn't need help.
->**You are doing a good job already, just look at the good photos you got**<-
"..." Anon looked at the close ups of the Glaceon's tasty butt he took, it was so inviting and he felt frustrated. "Why didn't I just dig in on the spot...?"
He sighed before laying down on the tent floor, unable to get his eyes off of the photo. He was rock-hard already, and before he realzied he was jerking off again to the pics of the Glaceon. He breathed shakily, kicking his clothes off as he kept going.
He wanted to bury his face against the Glaceon's rump so bad. "F-Fuck... I'm not gonna let anyone else..." The thought of being Queen's only toy turned him on even more and soon enough he came. It felt even better than the last time, Anon almost humped his own hand to the thought of servicing the Glaceon's butt like a good slave should. "I need... I need it...!" He panted heavily before cumming, covering his hand with absurd amount of cum while moaning shakily.
His whole body was filled with pleasant feeling of purpose, a place where he should be. He is a good servant for his Queen.

After finishing, he just lied down on the tent floor while staring the roof confused. It felt wrong but good, scary but fulfilling.
"I-It's just a fantasy... But maybe I should go back to the town..." He said while cleaning his body with some tissues before looking at his phone, it was already 8pm. "Time sure flies, I guess I'll sleep and tomorrow I'll head back to the town."
Anon stopped. He started wondering what would happen if the Glaceon came back next night. Anon started setting up an alarm on his phone.
"It was before 2am last time... I'll put 1:30am and then stay up until she comes." He said to himself "Hopefully I get a proper picture of her..." Anon snuggled himself inside the sleeping bag closed his eyes, tossing and turning for a while thinking about the Glaceon. After some time however he managed to finally fall asleep.


**Night 3: Fantasy**
Something is getting closer to Anon's tent, making him wake up. He blinks few times, looking to his side to find his phone. "Oh... It wasn't the phone..."
He closes his eyes again for just a while before realizing what, or **who** is making the sound. Anon goes on full-alert, his eyes shooting open as he carefully takes the camera and readies it.
"Okay, calm down... Just take a pic of the Glaceon when it pushes it's head inside again..." He first makes sure that he has clothes on so he doesn't make same mistakes as before when the Glaceon... The moment he remembered the Glaceon's stare his pants formed a tent of it's own.
"...! C-Come on... Go down... Fuck..." He closed the sleeping bag enough to cover his crotch, being as quiet as he can while sitting up and getting ready to take the photo. The Pokemon outside does it's familiar walk around the tent before stopping in front of it.
"Alright... Open the zipper... I'm gonna get a perfect photo of your huge head..." Anon thought to himself and as he expected, the Glaceon outside started opening the zipper to his tent. 
"Any second now..." But instead of it pushing it's head inside or silence, the Pokemon outside kept walking around in front of the tent. Anon still waits silently, thinking that maybe the Glaceon is going to look around before pushing it's head in.
"..." Silence. All Anon can hear is his own careful and quiet breath. "...Did she go away...?" He swallows nervously, leaning towards the opened zipper before suddenly... "!!!"
 
The Glaceon backs up inside, pushing it's huge rear inside the tent first. Anon just barely manages to realize what is going on before his face buried between the icy Pokemon's cheeks. Glaceon keeps squirming itself inside the tent growling a bit frustrated while pressing Anon against back of the tent. 
The whole tent shakes a bit as the Glaceon manages to fit it's huge body inside, pushing Anon against the floor with it's butt. Anon just screamed helplessly against the the Pokemon's butt before realizing the situation. His heart started beating hard, he felt his face against her backdoor. "...!" Glaceon purred pleased while giving small shakes to it's rump, encouraging Anon to...
Anon breathed shakily, parting his lips carefully. His hands started softly rubbing it's huge butt.
Glaceon in turn gave another shake to it's hips. "Yeah... I-I don't need to hold back... Right?" Anon thought before starting to lewdly kiss and lick his Queen's butt. She in turn let out a happy pleased sound which was soon followed by sound of the zipper closing. Anon couldn't care at all what was happening, this was what he had been waiting for since he came here... No since he was born. He had always wanted this, to be his Queen's servant who lives to please her.
Anon moaned in bliss, hugging the Glaceon's rump while bucking his hips like an animal against the sleeping bag. "Why did I close it...? Oh Arceus why..." He thought, regretting it so much.
But not as much as when the phone's alarm went suddenly off.
The Glaceon jumped from the sudden alarm, growling angrily as it kicked the phone against the floor. The screen shattered completely and went quiet, but Glaceon wasn't happy. The huge Poke slammed it's hips against Anon's face several time, Anon whimpering weakly under her. "S-Sorry... I-I just..." The Glaceon growled angrily, slowly opening the zipper as it lifted it's butt away from Anon's face. Anon realized that his Queen was going to leave.
"Please don't...! I-I...!" He sounded pathetic, completely out of it as he buried his face against the Glaceon's butt, french kissing her hole, doing his best to make his Queen to feel good. He was ashamed, thinking how he could do something like that to his Queen?
The Glaceon grinned, even though Anon couldn't see it.

She gave a small shake to her butt, as a 'show me how much you want it'. Anon instantly knew what she meant, sloppily making out with her hole. He squeezed her butt helplessly, desperately. Not wanting to let go no matter what. The Glaceon started purring happily sitting on Anon's face again and for time being Anon wasn't going to let go, no matter if he wanted or not.
He felt his torso being completely wet from his Queen's juices, and just the thought of him making the Glaceon happy made him cum. He moaned against the Glaceon's backdoor, almost screaming from pleasure. This was like **fantasy**, a dream which he never wanted to wake up from. His hips kept bucking desperately while he made a mess inside his sleeping bag, his cock desperately wanting to feel his Queen's fur. But he couldn't, and Anon knew why.
->**He didn't deserve it yet. He has to do a better job before he deserves to feel the Queen's soft fur**<-
 Glaceon kept purring, giving more shakes to it's butt as a reward for Anon. He was in complete bliss, getting drunk from kisses he was allowed to give to the Queen. He came again, moaning happily, almost drooling from pleasure and utter happiness and fulfillment. All he wanted to do was to keep licking and kissing her, forever between his Queen's lovely buns...


**Day 4: Purpose**
It was already midday when Anon wakes up, feeling light-headed. "Ah... What...?" He sat up weakly before noticing that his whole torso was covered in some kind of wet... Juices? Confused, he started opening his sleeping bag only to see the mess he had made, his underwear completely drenched in cum.
"What... Why is my chest covered in Queen's ju-"
His head started hurting, he remembered what happened last night. The image of the Que- Glaceon's rump against his face made him pant heavily, excited. Anon's member got excited as well, throbbing violently inside his underwear.
"Nnh...!" Anon let out a helpless whimper, his hand shakily going to his underwear and pulling his member out. "I-I..." He started masturbating, feeling the Glaceon staring at him intensively, like commanding him to do it. "Y-Yes... I..."
Anon's eyes went wide open. He looked around in panic, he was all alone inside the tent. But whenever he closed his eyes, he could feel her staring him. "My head... It hurts..." Anon kept panting helplessly while jerking off, he wanted to bury his face against the Glaceon's delicious butt and just like last night, serve and worship it...
"!!!?" He came suddenly, his body tensing up. It felt like something was invading his brain, reshaping how he was thinking, it was taking control over him. Anon panted heavily, staring blankly forward as his intense orgasm died down.
He looked down to see his hand covered in his thick seed. There was so much more of it, he never had came so much. He shakly moved his hand away from his crotch and started putting his clothes on, almost crying in panic. "T-There is something wrong with me... W-What is going on...?"
He clumsily got his clothes on, not caring about the Queen's juices all over his torso. It was afterall almost a trophy to Anon, being marked and cummed against by the Queen is an hono- "S-STOP!!!" He held his head confused, panting shakily, crying in confusion. "W-What is happening to me!? I-I..." He felt Glaceon staring him again, making him shake his head. "G-Get out of my head! LEAVE ME ALONE!" Anon screamed in panic, punching the air in front of him, only hitting the bouncy texture of the tent.

After few minutes of screaming and flailing around, he managed to calm down. Anon was breathing heavily, holding his head. He didn't want to close his eyes, all he could see was the Glaceon's eyes staring at him whenever he closed his own. "I... I gotta get out of here. Now, this instant." Anon whispered to himself. If he stayed there, something bad was going to happen to him. His final barrier to reason was keeping him at least somewhat sane.
Anon bit his own arm, desperate to know he was still alive and in his own senses. It hurt. "Okay... I am still here... I am still myself..." He could barely blink, even just a second of keeping his eyes closed made the intense staring of his Queen commanding him to mastur-
"!!!" Anon bit his own hand again, letting out another helpless whimper, breathing sharply through his nose. "..." After calming down again, he got up and started to pack up, putting his winter clothes on. "I rather do the Summer classes than stay here... I rather... I rather die than stay here..." Anon kept repeating to himself, he couldn't stop talking, he had to hear anything but the voice inside his own head.
After managing to pack everything up, he put on his backpack and breathed a sigh of relief. The cold air was refreshing at least. "Okay... All I have to do is go south... It's just few hour walk back to the town." It was bright morning, nothing bad would happen like this. He'll get to his Queen in just two hours if he is lucky. Confirming he has everything on him, Anon starts following the Glaceon's paw prints deeper to the north.

It had been just an hour of zigzagging between trees as he followed the huge paw prints. "I didn't eat breakfast... I'll eat something when I get back to the town." The idea of going back to Queen and getting to *eat* her ass all day made him feel happy. He sighed pleased at the thought before slowing down.
"Wait..." His whole body was shaking as he looked down, only now realizing what was going on. "I... I was supposed to..." He started going through his pockets for his phone to check the map. "Ah, there..." Anon's heart sunk as he saw the broken screen. The phone didn't even turn on.
"Oh right, Queen broke it when the alarm went off..." The memory of Glaceon getting angry and lifting it's huge rump from Anon's face made him angry. **Really angry**. "You fucking useless piece of shit..." He said quietly to the phone while gripping it tightly. The screen cracked a bit more from the surprising force of his hand. "You almost made her leave you fucking...!" Anon yelled, flinging the phone at the closest tree with all his might.
The phone completely broke apart, taking some of the pine's bark with it. Anon angrily kept staring at the remains of the phone. "That'll teach you for..."
His breathing went shaky again and looked at his own hands in complete horror. "What is wrong with me!?" Anon cried out scared, looking around and seeing the Glaceon's paw prints in the snow leading deeper in the north. "I-I gotta get out...! South! I need to go south!" He said before starting to ran back towards the camp.

Just after few minutes of running in the deepening snow, he was getting closer to the Queen. It was hard terrain, but he was sure if he just got back to her and apologized, she would forgive the whole phone thing. "!?"
Anon looked down, he was following the same paw prints again. "STOP! STOP!" Clutching his head, Anon ran away.
Anywhere else but where his or the Glaceon's paw prints are.
He kept running and crying helplessly for several minutes until he got to a boulder. He kept leaning against it, burying his face against the cold snow. It was cold. It hurt. Anon gritted his teeth before pulling out with a long gasp for air. "I-I..." He was awake. He was himself. Just to make sure, he pinched his cheek. It hurt as well. He looked down, no paw prints. Anon tried to be as systematic and logical as he could.
"Okay... Okay..." He kept taking deep breaths while looking up at the sky, it was probably Afternoon. "I have time... I know I have..." Saying quietly to himself, Anon looked around a bit. He didn't know where he was.
"I... I should go back to the camp. And from there I know which way is south." He closed his eyes for a bit, trying to remember which was the general direction he came from. "Okay... I should follow the paw pr-" Anon opened his eyes, his body already took few steps towards the path he came from, towards Glaceon.
"No closing eyes... No matter what... Keep eyes open... Small blinks if needed..." Anon talked to himself quietly, looking around some more. "I'll just walk through the bushes to that direction... I ran straight to the side, so if I go there, I should get somewhere close to the camp... I'm sure I'll recognize the area around it..." It wasn't the smartest plan, but getting close the paw prints was a suicide.
He slapped his cheeks times and started walking through the bushes and hard terrain, trying to stay away from the path he came from.

It had been at least three hours, nothing seemed familiar. His legs started hurting from walking the rough snowy terrain, falling over multiple times.
"I... I'm lost..." Anon finally admitted to himself, cold tears running down his cheeks. Breathing heavily he walked to a small rock and sat down, looking up at the sky.
It was evening, time was going by much faster than he expected. "At this rate I have to put my tent up... I can't walk all night... I'm so tired... Wait...?" He got up, the sky was clear. "Maybe I can look at stars and navigate with them... What did the northern star look like again... Uhh..." He tried to remember, focusing hard. "Mmnh... Maybe I should ask from my Queen... She knows where to g-"
He punched the small rock he was sitting on. It hurt but brought Anon back to reality. His mind was drifting between reality and his true calling. At this rate his Queen will be disapp- "STOP!! STOP!!"
He shook his head in panic, punching the rock few more times before his body started holding back. His almost fractured his knuckles, and the pain set in making Anon gasp shakily. "Aah... Fuck..." He fell on his knees and curled up. He doesn't remember anything hurt this bad before.
"I... I'm here. I'm me..." Saying to himself and holding his tears back, Anon got up weakly. His eyes looked for any decetly open flat surface. "There... I can camp there..." He shakily walked over the small clearing, getting ready to put his tent up.

It was warm inside the tent but Anon wasn't going to relax. He was hugging his knees, staring at the zipper intensively. He felt so tired but knew he couldn't sleep.
"I'm safe here... She won't get here..." Anon convinced himself, looking at the backpack next to him. "...Maybe I could make her run off if I use flash on the camera?" He picked up the camera and was ready to look at the lovely pics he took yesterd-
"!!" Instead of panicking, he *carefully* placed it down. "Don't panic... Don't think about it... Stay vigilant... She won't get here..." Anon sat still like that for a while before suddenly hearing steps.
He felt like crying, the steps got closer and his dick started throbbing. His mouth started salivating, he was hungry afterall so what would be better than to eat your Queen's tasty butt?
"Stop..." Anon whimpered, wanting to get the thoughts out of his head, but it was futile.
"I-I'll just don't let her in... I-I'll put the backpack in front of it... Then she won't fit here..." He said quietly to himself as his Queen got closer. Anon moved some stuff around to make some more room for her. He wanted to make sure that he had room to serve her afterall.
"...No... I-I..." He kept shaking his head while removing his clothes. He was losing himself completely, drifting towards his true calling, the only reality that matters. Anon nodded as he got his clothes off. He was hoping that if he apologized, maybe she would let him rub his lowly dick against her fur. Just the thought of it made his cock throb and leak cum.
"O-Oh... I-I... Don't open it..." The Glaceon stopped in front of the tent. Anon was shaking, he could hear her breathing. But nothing was happening.
"Ah... Of course... Sorry Queen I..." He apologized, grabbing the zipper before realizing what he was doing. "Why... I..."
He could hear the Glaceon, his Queen purring outside.
His body got hot, this is gonna make her happy? Did she forgive him already?
"I-I..."
Was he going to get a reward? Queen was so nice for someone as low as him, of course he would open the door for his Queen.
"Sorry for the wait...!" Anon opened the zipper, Glaceon backing up against his face like last night, burying it between her plump cheeks so he could make out with the lovely perfect butt of his Queen.


**Night 4: New life**
Glaceon's weight pressed Anon tightly against the tent floor, but Anon couldn't care less. Even if the weight on his body hurted a bit, he was in complete bliss for the chance to serve his Queen. His hands squeezed and rubbed the Glaceon's plump cheeks while his face was buried between them, his tongue licking all around her backdoor.
Anon was feeling so thankful, his Queen had forgiven him for his rebellious behavior, trying to get away from her. Glaceon purred pleased as Anon kept thanking for her forgiveness with lewd moans and kisses against the hole. Glaceon in turn rewarded him by pressing it's butt harder agaist Anon's face.
It hurt, but he didn't care. Just by getting hurt by her was a reward for him, especially getting hurt like this. Anon had completely forgotten why he even was there in the first place. Academy, Research Project, home, family... All of it meant nothing.
His mind kept drifting away, forgetting past life bit by bit as he serviced his Queen. Anon wrapped his legs around the Glaceon's side, starting to hump against it's soft fur. He could feel the cock burying a bit against the softness as he moaned and cried from pleasure against her backdoor. His Queen finally gave him permission, he deserved to hump against her.
There was no way Anon could last long, getting to french kiss Queen's ass while feeling her soft fur rubbing against his cock was more than he could ever ask. Just after few thrusts of his hips he came between the fur and his own body. It was intense, he started losing his mind completely. His head hurt and he was unable think properly.
"What is my name...?" Anon thought confused, his mind tried to call back to memories, trying to remember anything. But all he saw was the Glaceon's intense stare in his mind, reminding what his name was again.
-> **"Toy"** <-
Anon giggled happily, drunk from pleasure. "Of course, Queen of course remembers my name, I don't need to remember such pointless things." He realized while feeling like his brain was being drained away. The Glaceon lifted it's huge rump up and slammed it against Anon's face, he was forgetting his job.
"Ahh! S-Sorr- MMH!" He returned to hump against the soft fur and making out with the Queen's anus, french kissing it deep and rolling his tongue all around the insides. Glaceon's lewd juiced drenched Anon's torso completely, rubbing it's lower lips to masturbate with Anon. The thought of being useful for his Queen made Anon even happier, there couldn't be anything else he would want anymore. Just eternal servitude to his Queen, making her feel good, nothing else matters anymore.
The moment Anon felt Glaceon's juices on the fur and his cock, he started cumming uncontrollably. Moaning and screaming against the Glaceon's backdoor from pure brainmelting pleasure, he passed out.

Anon woke up, his mind screaming him to escape. That thought lasted full two seconds before he realized that Glaceon's butt was still resting against his face. And as he started to kiss and lick his Queen's backdoor, the Glaceon purred pleased, letting out a small moan.
His mind completely broke, hearing Glaceon moan from his service broke the last barrier of reason in his head
*He was never coming back*
Anon just kept seeing flashes of consciousness as he kept worshipping his Queen's hole. Otherwise his whole mind was just filled with the Glaceon staring him and telling what to do:

->**Keep kissing me.**<-

->**Keep kissing me.**<-


**Day 8: Happiness**
He had no idea where he was. He started getting used to pleasure, not passing out after cumming. He still had no idea what or who he was, he only knew he had to serve Queen. It was all that mattered.
"Oh yeah, I'm Toy..." Anon said as he buried his face against the Glaceon's backdoor.

Time passes, but he doesn't notice it. After the Queen is satisfied with Anon's service, she goes out to eat. Anon is left to lie down in the Queen's tent. while breathing heavily, his head and torso covered in her juices. "This place is warm, Queen is so nice to let me stay there."
He sees a strange... Tool next to him. He doesn't know what it is, but knows for sure it isn't important and is taking space in Queen's tent. Weakly, Anon sits up and opens the tent's zipper, throwing the camera out. Good riddance. He... Said?
Nothing came out of his mouth. Oh yeah, he never learnt to speak afterall. "Maybe if I do good job, Queen will teach me." Thinking about Queen made him horny, his cock throbbing bright red from all the abuse and cumming it had been endured. He wanted to masturbate but Queen didn't give him the permission. He was frustrated, but he could never be angry.
"Queen knew for the best, Toy shouldn't waste his time thinking. It was better like that. Thinking is too hard for Toy."
He heard Queen approaching again. It had been few hours, but time was hard thing to think or keep track of him. As the Glaceon opened the zipper, it looked at Anon, who smiled like and idiot.
Glaceon gave him a lewd sloppy kiss on his face as he came. He wasn't sure in which order those happened.
Queen was sitting on his face again, it's time for Toy to do his job.
""French kissing Queen's lovely butt feels so good."
"It's getting dark."
"Hurts."
"Feels good."
"Queen is sleeping, but Toy shouldn't stop. Toy will keep kissing as long as it makes Queen happy."


**Night 84: Future**
"I love my Queen." It was only thing Anon could think.
It makes him more than happy.
"Toy's body hurts, Toy feels weak."
"But it's better this way. Toy is Queen's propery"
