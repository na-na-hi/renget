My name is Otto. I'm a barber in Altdorf, one of the best. I've served nobles and shaved the heads of warrior priests, I even pleated the beard of a visiting dwarf Thane. Everyone knew about my skill and the wonders I could work with hair. That turned out to be the problem. They came for me at night. A dozen scurrying misshapen things broke into my townhouse and took me. Bound my arms and legs, tied a filthy stained sack over my face and carried me into the night. How far and how deep I don't know but by Sigmar they took me. Through reeking tunnels and waterways, deep below the city.

Eventually I was thrown down. I could hear things all around me chittering and scurrying and TALKING in some horrible tongue I couldn't understand. 

As the sack was torn from my head the smell hit me like a war hammer. Rot, sweat and a primal feral musk that was so thick I could almost taste it as it clung to the inside of my mouth in a greasy layer.

My eyes started to tear up from the intolerable stink, before they could focus on what was in front of me.
I was in a warren somewhere, a cave or tunnel carved underneath the world. Torches burned fitfully and the horrible shapes were moving and darting all around.

Except one. One was right in front of me. Looming over me as I sat there on my knees.

It was a rat. A giant, white horned rat. Standing there on two legs and staring down at me with its piercing green eyes. Like some vile parody of man it was clothed in a thick robe or some dark course fabric, covered in jagged symbols and dark stains. In it's hand...paw? It carried a gnarled and twisted staff of some black wood, topped with another of the symbols, this one an inverted triangle.

And behind it I saw more of them. The whole cavern was swarming with ratmen! I could feel my heart beat faster, my panic getting frantic as I was sure I was about to die in some horrible indescribable way. 

And then the rat smiled, and it SPOKE. 
"You have the glory-honor of being in the presence of I, the great-mighty grey seer Grisknik!"
The voice was a strange sort of high pitched rumble. I cannot lie it was not as foul or repugnant as I would have assumed.

It reached down and grabbed my face, hauling me to my feet with unexpected strength. Its muzzle was pressed against my neck as it sniffed up and down, its fur oily but surprisingly fine and soft. And blessed Sigmar, its smell! Overpowering musk, earthy and tinged with a sickly sweetness. It was the reek of an animal, a strong, powerful male. Though alien and wrong I couldn't help but...enjoy it? Before I could think further I saw its great front teeth flashing in the torchlight and I braced for it to rip my throat out.

But I didn't die yet. It forced me to look into its glowing eyes and continued,
"My spies have been seek-watching you for many days. Your nest-warren is visited by your own priest-idols and rulers. Why? What manner of man-worm are you that they go to seek you? Speak-squeak quickly and true. A useful slave is always more appreciated than a simple flesh-meal "

I sputtered an answer 
"I-I'm a barber. A good one! The finest in all of Altdorf!"

It tilted its head to level its gaze at me.
"Barber. And what, little man-thing, do you barb? Weapons? Armor? I have been watching you idiot-fool! You have no tools for that sort of craft-making!"
Its claws began to dig into my face, just short of drawing blood with its crushing grip.
"I. Will. Not. Be. Deceived."  
I squeezed my eyes shut blind terror and babbling I replied, desperate to save myself before he crushed my jaw
"Hairdresser! I cut hair! The best in the Empire! Dwarfs, nobles, priests, even an elector count once!"

The monstrous pressure on my face stopped increasing, and slowly returned to a mere death-grip. Even the damnable skittering had stopped. It was as if the entire warren was holding its breath, waiting for the Seer to pass judgement. After several seconds of silence I could stand it no longer. Heart hammering in my chest I opened one eye and dared to look at my tormentor. It was staring at me with one unreadable green eye.

"Hair...cutter?" It said slowly, unfamiliar with the concept. 
"You claim that all of these man-things, even the vile dwarf-worms, will seek-find you. Just to have you...groom them?"

"y-yes, yes! I groom them! Cut and style, wash and shave, anything they could want!"

"Hmm. To have a grooming-slave...it must be a sign of great import! Yes-Yes! A creature-thing so well trained-broken that betrayal cannot occur. For truly, the great-worthy are far to important to bother groom-cleaning themselves"

Grisknik slowly nodded, a gross parody of a smug grin stretching along its muzzle. It's eyes shone with a predatory gleam. 
"Rejoice, pathetic man-thing. You will groom-clean me, the great-powerful Grisknik! and if you are as good-skilled as you claim-speak, you may even live long enough to do it again"

I'd agree to anything, if I had a chance of living. I eagerly nodded my head, as best I could in his brutal grasp.

"Yes, of course! It will be my greatest honor oh mighty and great lord! B-but I will need my tools to properly g-groom and style your fur"

He began to drag me along the warren by my face as he squeaked something in his own vile language to the assembled rats, sending them all scurrying off. He addressed me as I stumbled after him into the dark tunnels.
"My night-runners will get your tool-implements, but you will begin grooming me once I have you properly safe-stored away. A Seer as great-important as Grisknik has many scheming underling-rivals. Oh, how they will look upon my glistening coat and despair-hate! You WILL make me even more glorious-radiant than I am now. No simple-easy task-order"

In the distance I could see a dim light, sputtering like a small flame. I was pulled into what looked like a study. There was a rickety desk covered in tattered books and scrolls and a lone candle burning, a pile of furs and stolen carpets in one corner and a bubbling cauldron in the center of the room. And in every corner, from every hole in the moldering walls, rats stared out at me. Beady red eyes, full of some unnatural intelligence. 

I was thrown onto the pile of bedding suddenly, and the stench of the seer was overwhelming here. It was hot and humid, like no heat ever left. Its musk was totally overpowering now that it was separated from the stink of the common filth in the warrens and it clung to me like a damp cloud. It had a charged quality, like the smell before a storm. Tingling and ethereal yet damp and earthy, a heady mix of sweat and something I couldn't describe. It burned into my brain, and I found it more difficult to think of it as anything other than...pleasant. I breathed slightly deeper to get more of it.

I turned to find the Seer wedging the makeshift door closed, bolting and chaining it shut over and over. Finally it carved a jagged symbol in the splintery wood with the head of it's staff, and there was a burst of green light. I rose to my knees as it turned, and the world seemed to slow down as I saw its robe fall away. Its odor in the room grew noticeably without the cloth to smother it.

The seer stood before me, naked and almost glowing white. I could see the grease and oil in its fur, the tangles and knots and what look terribly like bloodstains. Blessedly it was free of the pustules and boils I had seen on the other ratmen in the warren. But what drew my gaze were the sheer size of the horns on its head. How could I have missed those in the cave earlier? They curled upwards like a bulls and I could not look away. 

It grinned down at me with a lecherous sneer 
"So quickly the man-thing learns! Yes-yes, gaze-stare at the blessings of the Great Horned One and grovel before my power-strength! But you may worship-adore me later groomer-thing. When you have earned it. Now you must work-toil"

It gestured downwards and my breath was stolen by what I saw. IT was very much a HE. A fat sheath lurked between his pale white legs, its size easily comparable to my own manhood, at least 6 inches. But below it was something incredible. His jewels were HUGE, at least the size of a mans fist. And they PULSED as I watched. They squirmed with motion before my eyes and by Taal I swear I could SEE the musk coming off of them, and a small traitorous voice in the back of my head rejoiced.

Grisknik stalked towards where I sat on my knees in the pile of bedding, stopping with his swollen balls just inches from my face. I gazed up at him and I had to suppress a heretical thought of how RIGHT it was to look up at him like this. His masculine odor was the impossible to describe at this distance. Beyond overpowering, I could almost feel it make my own loins stir into life. I...I really wanted this? My hands drifted through the distance between us on their own, stopping just short of touching his thighs.
With a great effort I cleared my head just enough to speak.

"Mighty lord, how am I to groom you without my tools?"

I felt one of his paws wrap around the back of my head as he look down at me over his manhood. Not gently, but without the crushing grip from before. Slowly my face was pushed forward and into his groin until it was smothering my face entirely. The heat of it was maddening and I could almost taste him, even with my mouth closed. The skin and fine fur on his sack stuck to my face with a thick layer of his sweat and I could feel the motion of them, hear them churning full of his potent seed. From above I heard him say,

"Man-things, so clever yet so foolish. Clean my glory as a Skaven would. Lick" 
I did the only thing I could.
I opened my mouth. 
The taste hit me immediately, covering the inside of my mouth in an oily layer and I could already feel myself getting lightheaded. This musk...it was simply too much for a mortal man to deal with. Slowly I pressed my tongue flat against his bulging, squirming sack and I licked upwards. The taste was as I expected, deep and earthy, a thick layer of old oils and salty sweat making it rank and contrasting with whatever was causing that tingling unearthly flavor. I pressed my face in, eager to please and possibly eager to taste more. I began lapping at his squirming jewels, a sliver of my professionalism shining through even during this base act. First against the grain of the hair, then with it I licked up and down the both of them, before grabbing the massive orbs and pulling them up and over my face so that I could get to the backside of them. 

His masculine reek was stronger here, closer to his rear. I enjoyed a deep breath before continuing with my work. I slowly lapped my way up the back of his throbbing ballsack, towards the cleft of his legs. As I pulled away from his bloated orbs they stuck to my face with a layer of spittle and his ever present sweat. After a moment the loose skin of his sack peeled away from my sweat drenched face with a lewd squelching noise, leaving my face absolutely covered in his musky balljuices. Sigmar preserve me I was harder than I'd ever been in my life.

"Aaaaaahhhh such a good-dedicated creature this Man-Thing is! If it is as talented as it is eager, then it just may be worthy of living to serve me further!" Grisknik exaulted as he shifted his grip on my head and ran a clawed thumb through my hair in an almost delicate fashion. My face flushed deeper at his praise and I quickly busied myself with mouthing at the fork of his legs, my face pressing left and right into all of his crevices making certain that he would find no fault with my devotion or my handiwork.

This spot must have been sensitive, Grisknik's hand spasmed for a moment before he pulled me harshly to the side and pressed my face into his thigh while he tittered a sharp wheezing laugh. I worked up and down both of his legs while Grisnik pulled and dragged my by my hair, eerily silent aside from an occasional chuckle.

I was jostled from my thoughts as I was pulled away completely from his fur and I looked back at my work. The fur of his legs was smoothed down and sleeker with my spit, but even in my musk drunk state I could see knots and  uneven patches I would need proper tools to care for. His bulging jewels were churning and glistening with a fresh layer of sweat and saliva, but they lacked the built up oil I had dutifully swallowed down. His Rathood was still sheathed, but I could see a thin trickle of a clear liquid leaking steadily from his sheath giving of a new musk. Sharper and more heady than the earthy charged scent that was Grisknik's usual aroma.

I...I wanted to taste it? Sigmars hammer I did. I tried to lean forward to wrap my lips around his weeping slit, but his claws wrapped in my hair jerked me back painfully.

"Ah ah ahhh! Naughty little barber-servant wants to taste Grisknik's seed? To suck-lick on his mighty sheath to summon his great-powerful rathood?" Grisnik crooned mockingly as he forced me to look him in his burning green eyes, smoldering with amusement. His words affected me more than I thought and the object of my fevered desire was torn from my sight I let out a small whimper. The sneer stretching across his muzzled face told me he heard.

I fliched as something fat and hairless smacked me on the nose. Not hard enough to hurt, but more than enough to startle. It was his tail. He just swatted my nose with his tail like I was some kind of disobedient pet! 

"Bad barber-thing. Clean-groom first, and you may suck-worship later, if you grovel-beg enough yes-yes." 

With that he pushed my face to the fine fur of his stomach, just above his hot, musky, drooling...his sheath just above his sheath! I could feel it right under my chin, devilishly warm and the clear strong scent was both intoxicating and clearing my head so that I could focus on my loss of control. I gazed into Grisknik's glowing green eyes and my tongue and lips worked a trail up his belly. His claws once again stroked my hair, rewarding my service. If my face was not fully flushed before it certainly was now, redder than a Bordeleaux wine. 

I was startled when I came across a hard nub low on his belly. Curious I rolled my tongue around it and Grisnik shivered and made a high squeaking noise. It was a nipple! Curious, I gave it a light nip and moved upwards until I licked over another one. Again I treated this one to a gentle suckle and nibbling, enjoying watching Grisknik's whiskers spasms and twitch as he attempted to keep his muzzle still. As I made my way further up I found more and more fleshy buds on him, six of them on this side. Not looking away from his eyes I licked over to the other side of his chest before kissing my way down another line of hard fleshy bumps. I could not see them but I was certain they were all swollen and red from my ministrations. Finally unable to contain himself Grisknik crooned a high pitched whine, his eyes narrowing but never looking away. They smouldered with a new emotion, one I couldn't place on his inhumane muzzle. 

My hands, I realized had moved around to cup and grope Grisnik's firm behind. They had been kneading and squeezing the taut flesh for some time now, and I marvelled at how perfect it felt. Lean muscle with barely a hint of fat but it was so delightfully malleable in my grasp. Each squeeze sent a rush of primal lust to my achingly hard and painfully ignores member. I could have spent an evening enjoying this ass had it been on a human lover, but now I was not certain that such a distinction was important anymore.

"Ooh, does the puny Man-Barber seek to tempt-bribe Grisnik away from his promised grooming? No-no, you have been taking advantage of my eager-joy! Back to work!"

With a start he lifted his right paw up and shoved me into the pit of his arm where the raw musk of him hit me full in the face before he lowered his arm and locked my head on place. The sweaty stench was unreal, a vivid swampy fog that instantly drenched my hair and face even further than they had been and set my eyes burning and watering. The taste, Taal help me it was vile. It was acrid and bitter and I couldn't lick it up fast enough. I hated that I was enjoying this, or so I tried to tell myself. It was hard to not simply bury my face in deeper and lose myself totally but I had to still impress the ratman holding me in his stinking pit. 

"So much better, isn't it barber-servant? Now work-work and lick-clean and prove to me that you are a worthy tool-agent and not some foolish man-thing to be eaten!"

So I licked and sucked every inch. I got every last drop of his sweat and oil, old and new. And eventually I was released from the musky steaming prison of his underarm. I gasped at the fresh air and tried to clear my eyes. Suddenly the claws in my hair released me and I was shoved onto my back. I started to rise before a warning growl from the Seer froze me in place. He stood above me as I stared at his naked glory and I could feel my hardness twitch at the sight of it. He slowly turned around, grinning at me from over his shoulder as his paws reached to to grab his own rump. As Grisknik slowly spread himself open and raised his tail, exposing his winking pink star, he squeaked giddily at me.

"Now is your final task-order! Live-live or die-die depends on how you show the great-awesome Grisknik just how eager to serve you are. My nightrunners will return-claim your tools in a matter of hour-times. Until then I will need to rest-sit and think." 

As he delivered his madmans demands he sank down on his knees, squatting on my chest until his tail hole was all I could see, his cheeks blocking out everything to either side of my face. If I had thought I had known what musk was I was wrong. Words absolutely failed as I was totally overwhelmed by the raw wave of his pure masculine scent that completely overpowered anything resembling thought.

Before Grisknik had finished his decent I had risen up to meet him, kissing his tight entrance like it was a long lost lover returned to me, shoving my face into him as hard as I could as my arms wrapped around his waist and pulled him the rest of the way down onto me. Grisnik gave a surprised squeak and his tunnel flexed around me  while his cheeks pulled me closer. I was totally buried in his scent. His bedding piled around me, blocking out all light as I feverishly made love to his passage with my mouth. Kissing, tongue probing his depths and sucking on his plump pucker, I pulled him closer and closer to me, I could not bear the thought that he would ever rise, that this could ever end. As all thoughts left my mind I could hear his mad cackling laughter and feel his tail wrap around my neck, pulling me even closer. 

It felt right.
