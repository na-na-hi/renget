#Guan Chāo, The Unclean One

![Maggot Monk](https://i.ibb.co/kG1jNVt/OIG.jpg)
#Backstory
Guan Chāo, the Unclean One, was a man of dark and twisted mind, who trod the thin line between madness and genius. He was born in the Weeping Lands, a land of doom and gloom, where floods, famines and plagues ravaged the people. He was left alone in the world, when a strange pestilence swept his village and slew all but him. He lived by gnawing on the bones of his kin and neighbors, acquiring a relish for carrion and an resilience to disease. He dwelt in solitude and squalor, spurned by other outcasts and roaming from one calamity to another. He had no aim or ambition, only a dim wonder about the world and its secrets.

One day, he was found by Zhao Gongming, one of the Five Commissioners of Pestilence, a devil sect that wrought chaos and destruction through a warped understanding of the elements. Called the Minister of Jade Poxes, Zhao Gongming had gathered a hoard of riches by peddling his plagues to various warlords and tyrants. He was journeying through the Weeping Lands, seeking new sources of corruption and infection, when he beheld a young lad who was gorging on a putrid corpse. He was curious about the boy's aspect and aura, which bore marks of both sickness and nascent cultivation. He resolved to test the lad's potential, conjuring a horde of flesh-eating worms to encircle and consume the lad. To his amazement, the child was able to repel the beasts, greedily devouring some of them in turn. Zhao Gongming was astonished. He recognized that the lad was a rare genius and decided to take him as his disciple. He taught him their secret arts of wielding qi, life force and spiritual energy to create and command various plagues and parasites. Guan Chāo proved to be a fast and keen learner, mastering the skills of the sect and outshining his fellows. He became a mighty and merciless cultivator, ascending to the rank of one of the Five Commissioners.

But Guan Chāo soon grew dissatisfied with the devil sect's aims, which he deemed too mundane and petty. He thought that they were wasting their powers and resources on worthless wars and riches, instead of pursuing the transcendent, the ultimate truth of the Tao. He was captivated by the ebb and flow of life, and believed that by enduring disease one could attain true enlightenment. He regarded disease as a blessing from the heavenly realms, a way of purifying and perfecting one's body, mind and spirit. He experimented on himself and others, exposing himself to various poisons and toxins, hoping to uncover the secrets of the Tao hidden in the dirt and decay. He did not fear death, but welcomed it as a chance to be reborn into a higher state of being.

Abandoning the devil sect, Guan Chāo wandered across the territories, seeking the transcendent truth of the Tao in the wretched corners of the world. He visited places that were shunned by others for being foul or accursed, such as marshes, ruins, battlefields, and plague-ridden towns. He saw these places as holy grounds, where the cycle of life, death and rebirth was most clear and profound. He plunged himself into these environments, absorbing their qi and essence, and learning their secrets. However, his departure from the Five Commissioners of Pestilence created a malignant rift between Guan Chāo and his former master. In the beginning Zhao Gongming tried to coax his young apprentice to return to the sect with promises of wealth and domination, but Guan Chāo refused to heed. Guan Chāo reproached his old mentor for being blind and greedy, and insisted that he had found the true path to comprehending the Tao. Zhao Gongming, maddened and heartbroken by this grand betrayal, branded his former pupil as a traitor and swore to destroy him and his works.

In spite of his foul aspect and reputation, Guan Chāo was a merry and cordial man, who relished talking with others. He had a keen and open mind, always ready to learn new things and probe new possibilities. He taught among the beggars, lepers, outlaws and villains, who dwelt in the fringes of society and endured various plagues and maladies. He regarded them as his fellow pursuers of the Tao, who had been destined by fate to face ordeals and hardships that would cleanse and hone their spirits. He imparted his wisdom and doctrines to them, giving them a new outlook on their situations. He also infected them with his diseases, thinking that he was doing them a service by aiding them along the way of enlightenment. He considered death and sickness as essential steps to metamorphose into something grander, a way of casting off one’s old self and being reborn into a higher state of being. He did not mind the outcomes of his deeds, nor did he feel any regret or guilt. He believed that he was following the true Tao, and that he was conferring gifts of enlightenment upon those who required them.

#Tao
###The Worm That Writhes in Death [Tao: Living Being / Heavenly]
The Worm that Writhes in Death is a macabre philosophy of cultivation that draws inspiration from the lifecycle of the maggot. It is based on the idea that death is the source of all life, and that by embracing decay and rot, one can achieve immortality and transcendence. The practitioners of this philosophy are known as Maggot Taoists, and they follow these principles:

- The first principle is to ***feed on death***. Maggot Taoists seek out corpses, carrion, and other sources of decay, and consume them to nourish their bodies and souls. They believe that by eating the dead, they can absorb their essence and memories, and gain insights into the mysteries of life and death.

- The second principle is to ***breed in death***. Maggot Taoists use their bodies as hosts for maggots, worms, and other vermin, and allow them to multiply within them. They believe that by sharing their flesh with these creatures, they can form a symbiotic relationship with them, and gain a greater spiritual understanding of those natural beings that are closest to death.

- The third principle is to ***rejoice in death***. Maggot Taoists cultivate a mindset of joy and gratitude for the cycle of life and death, and view decay and rot as signs of beauty and vitality. They believe that by embracing death, they can overcome their fear of it, and achieve a state of peace and harmony.

The Worm that Writhes in Death is a philosophy that defies the natural order of the world, and is considered heretical and abhorrent by most other cultivators. It is also extremely dangerous, as it exposes the practitioners to various diseases, toxins, and parasites. However, those who follow this path claim that they have discovered secrets that no one else knows, and that they have glimpsed at the true nature of the Tao.

###Three Corpses Bountiful Feast [Soul Cultivation Technique]
The Three Corpses Bountiful Feast is a perverse cultivation technique that was devised by a notorious scholar known only as the Plague Monk. He was a ruthless and ambitious cultivator who sought to reach the peak of the heavenly realms by any means necessary. Through his studies he discovered the Three Corpses; a trio of demonic entities within the dantian of every cultivator that possess secret knowledge and immense power. However, they were also extremely cunning and malicious, and existed to constantly sabotage a cultivator’s progress and devour a cultivator’s essence, qi, and spirit.

The Plague Monk came up with a twisted idea to subdue the Three Corpses and harness their power for himself. He decided to infect himself with various deadly and incurable diseases, such as the *Nine Yin Plague*, the *Blood Rotting Poison*, and the *Soul Devouring Worms*. He then used a secret method to transfer these diseases into his dantian, where they would act as a macabre offering for the Three Corpses. The Three Corpses, being greedy and gluttonous, would eagerly devour these diseases, unaware that they were also weakening their own vitality and slipping into a state of indolence. The Plague Monk would then use his own willpower and cultivation to suppress the diseases from harming him, while also secretly siphoning the power of the Three Corpses.

This technique was extremely risky and dangerous, as it required a delicate balance between feeding and suppressing the diseases, as well as maintaining the stupor of the Three Corpses. If the Plague Monk made even a slight mistake, he would either be consumed by his diseases or be possessed by the Three Corpses. However, he was willing to take this gamble, as he believed that he could achieve unprecedented heights of cultivation by using this technique. He called it the Three Corpses Bountiful Feast, and for centuries he kept the technique a secret, only teaching it to a few of his most devout followers, those who were just as willing as he was to sacrifice their health and sanity for power.

###Rotting Furnace Refinement Technique [Profession: Alchemy Technique]
The Rotten Furnace Refinement Technique is a sinister and taboo method of alchemy that was created by an embalmer from a remote village in the Southern Wilds . The embalmer had a low aptitude for cultivation, but he was obsessed with the power of alchemy. He spent his life studying the art, but having no access to any alchemy manuals or teachers, he had to rely on his own experiments and observations for progress.

One day, he accidentally discovered that some of the corpses he treated with his preserving agents had undergone strange changes. Their flesh and bones had blackened, and their organs had developed strange growth that pulsed with noxious qi. The embalmer soon realized that he had uncovered a new form of alchemy, one that allowed for the use of human corpses as vessels to catalyze and refine alchemical processes. He named it the Rotten Furnace Refinement Technique, and he began to practice it in secret.

The Rotten Furnace Refinement Technique allows an alchemist to inject various substances into a human corpse that has decayed for no more than three days, and use their life force and essence as fuel to activate the alchemical reactions. The corpse acts as a furnace that contains and regulates the heat and pressure of the alchemical process, while also transforming and absorbing some of the substances into its own tissues. The alchemist can then harvest the organs and parts of the corpse that have been enhanced or modified by the alchemical process, and extract valuable materials from them.

The Rotten Furnace Refinement Technique is extremely dangerous and unethical, as it involves desecrating human bodies and exploiting their life force. It also requires a high level of skill and precision, as any mistake or imbalance in the alchemical process could result in explosions, mutations, or karmic curses. The embalmer eventually met his demise when one of his experiments went wrong and caused his entire laboratory to explode, killing him and exposing his crimes to the public. His technique was condemned by the majority of alchemy community as a heresy, but amongst the profane and mad the methods outlined in the embalmer's *Journey of 100,000 Corpses* manuals were seen as a treasure to be preserved.

###Four-Fold Steps in Shadow [Stealth Technique]
The Four-Fold Steps in Shadow is a stealth technique that is popular among the assassins of the Kū Kū Chuō Mountains. It allows one to merge with shadows and hide one’s presence from detection. The technique has four steps, each corresponding to a phase of the moon.

- The first step is called ***New Moon***. It is the most basic and essential step, where the cultivator learns to blend their aura with the surrounding darkness. The cultivator must find a shadowy place and meditate, letting go of their ego and becoming one with the night. This step requires a calm and focused mind, as well as a strong affinity for the yin element.

- The second step is called ***Waxing Crescent***. It is the step where the cultivator learns to move within the shadows without disturbing them. The cultivator must practice walking, running, jumping, and dodging in the dark, while maintaining their aura in harmony with the shadows. This step requires agility and coordination, as well as a keen sense of spatial awareness.

- The third step is called ***Full Moon***. It is the step where the cultivator learns to manipulate the shadows to their advantage. The cultivator must use their spiritual power to create illusions, distractions and even hide traps within the shadows. This step requires creativity and cunning, as well as a powerful cultivation base.

- The fourth and final step is called ***Waning Crescent***. It is the step where the cultivator masters the technique and becomes a true shadow walker. The cultivator can merge with any shadow, regardless of its size, shape, or source. The cultivator can also travel through shadows, appearing and disappearing at will. This step requires mastery and confidence, as well as a profound understanding of the yin-yang balance.

The Four-Fold Steps in Shadow is a formidable technique that can give any cultivator an edge in combat or espionage. However, it also has its drawbacks and risks. The technique can consume a lot of spiritual energy, especially at higher levels and cultivators skilled in the art of Detection may be able to perceive the subtle changes in the shadows. Additionally, those skilled with formations or arrays may create bright sources of light that can dispel the shadows and force the cultivator into the open. Therefore, the technique should be used with caution and moderation.

###Garden of the Wilted Plum Blossom [Profession: Poisoner Technique]
The Garden of the Wilted Plum Blossom is a secret poisoners art created by the Five Commissioners of Pestilence; a devil sect that uses their knowledge of the five elements and the natural world to create deadly plagues that can wipe out entire populations. The technique is based on the symbol of the plum blossom flower, which represents purity, beauty, and prosperity. However, the Five Commissioners of Pestilence twist this symbol into an instrument of horror, by *"wilting"* the blossom and spreading its corrupted essence.

The technique consists of five steps, or *"petals"*, each corresponding to one of the five elements: wood, fire, earth, metal, and water. The poisoner must follow these steps in order to create a successful plague:

- ***Wood***: The first petal is to find a suitable host for the plague, usually a plant or an animal that is abundant and easy to infect. The poisoner uses their qi to manipulate the life force of the host, making it more susceptible to the plague and more contagious to others. The host becomes the source of the plague, spreading it through its natural interactions with other living beings.

- ***Fire***: The second petal is to ignite the plague, by exposing it to a trigger that will activate its full potential. The trigger can be anything that causes a change in the environment, such as temperature, humidity, light, or sound. The poisoner uses their knowledge of the natural cycles and patterns to predict when and where the trigger will occur, and plan their attack accordingly. The trigger causes the plague to mutate and become more virulent, affecting more hosts and causing more damage.

- ***Earth***: The third petal is to nourish the plague, by providing it with a fertile ground to grow and spread. The poisoner uses their resources to create favourable conditions for the plague, such as contaminating water sources, sabotaging food supplies, or spreading misinformation. The poisoner also uses their influence to prevent any attempts to stop or cure the plague, by bribing officials, blackmailing doctors, or assassinating leaders. The plague thrives in the chaos and confusion created by the poisoner, reaching more victims and becoming more unstoppable.

- ***Metal***: The fourth petal is to sharpen the plague, by enhancing its lethality and efficiency. The poisoner uses their experiments to refine the plague, making it more resistant to natural defences, more adaptive to different hosts, and more selective in its targets. The poisoners also use their cunning to create diversions and distractions, such as false cures, fake outbreaks, or scapegoats. The plague becomes more deadly and deceptive, killing more people and evading more detection.

- ***Water***: The fifth and final petal is to cleanse the plague, by erasing any traces of its origin and existence. The poisoner uses their stealth to destroy any evidence of their involvement, such as samples, records, or witnesses. The poisoner also uses their wisdom to learn from their experience, improving their technique and preparing for their next attack. The plague disappears without a trace, leaving behind only death and mystery.

The Garden of the Wilted Plum Blossom is a technique that requires patience, skill, and intelligence. It is not a simple act of poisoning, but a complex art of creating plagues. Only the most dedicated and malevolent poisoners can master this technique, and only the most fortunate and vigilant can survive it.

###Crimson Corpse Palm [Ambush Combat Technique]
The Crimson Corpse Palm is a disgusting and volatile combat technique that originates from the Sanguine Monastery; a vile devil sect that practices the art of blood alchemy and necromancy. The technique involves infusing one’s right hand with a potent and corrosive, yin-aspected qi, which causes the skin, muscle, and bone of the hand to gradually decay and rot away, leaving behind only a bloody and skeletal claw. The user of this technique sacrifices their own flesh and vitality in exchange for immense destructive power. Anything that the Crimson Corpse Palm touches will be infected with a powerful spiritual disease, which will rapidly spread throughout the target’s body and cause it to wither and die. The technique is especially effective against living beings, as it can bypass their natural defences and directly attack their life force. The technique can also be used to destroy objects, such as weapons, armour, or walls, by causing them to weather, crumble and fall.

The Crimson Corpse Palm is not without drawbacks, however. To prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the user's body, the user of this technique must bind their right hand with alchemically prepared bandages. These bandages are soaked in a special solution that suppresses the disease and prevents the hand from spreading further decay. However, these bandages also limit the user’s mobility and sensitivity, making them less agile and responsive. To remove these bindings, the user must channel their qi through the bandages, causing them to dissolve. This process is nauseating and painful, as it causes the disease to violently flare up and begin draining the user's life force. The user must be careful not to waste their qi or expose their hand unnecessarily, or else they will suffer severe consequences.

Finally, despite the bandages' protections, the Crimson Corpse Palm is ultimately a self-destructive technique. The hand that wields this power will eventually rot completely, leaving behind only stump of rotten flesh and splintered bone. When this happens, the user of this technique has no choice but to replace their hand with that of a corpse's. This is the final, gruesome step of the Crimson Corpse Palm, which requires the user to sever their own hand and attach a new one using profane, blood alchemies. The new hand will then be infused with the same yin-aspected qi, and the cycle of decay and replacement will continue.

###100,000 Chittering Black Breaths [Summoning Technique]
The 100,000 Chittering Black Breaths is a grisly summoning technique that was developed by Guan Chāo, the Unclean One. He developed the principals of this technique while on a pilgrimage through the brackish and verminous mires of the Weeping Lands. He was inspired by the thriving colonies of maggots that made their home amidst the bloated corpses of a flooded village. To perform this technique, the cultivator must first devour a massive amount of rotten meat, preferably from corpses plagued with various diseases. The meat must be swallowed whole and without chewing, so that it can reach the stomach intact. There, it will serve as a fertile soil for the summoned maggots, which will feed on the flesh and multiply rapidly.

The cultivator must then withstand the unbearable pain and nausea caused by the maggots tunnelling inside their body, while using their spiritual energy to subjugate and assimilate them. This process can take days or even weeks, depending on the cultivator's strength and willpower. During this time, the cultivator must refrain from vomiting or expelling the maggots in any way, as that would ruin the technique.

Once the maggots have fully grown into flies, the cultivator can unleash them by opening their mouth and spewing out a black cloud of buzzing insects. The flies will swarm around the cultivator, forming a dark halo of twitching, black carapace. The cultivator can then control the flies with their mind, using them as extensions of their senses.  

The flies are not capable of doing much damage on their own, as they are small and fragile. However, they can be used to carry diseases and infect other living beings. The flies can also transmit what they see and hear to the cultivator, allowing them to extend their senses through the swarm. The more flies the cultivator vomits out, the more powerful their technique becomes. The technique is not without drawbacks, however. The cultivator must constantly supply the flies with spiritual energy, or they will die or turn against them. Additionally, the cultivator must be careful not to lose control of the flies, or they will be overwhelmed by their collective consciousness and become insane.
