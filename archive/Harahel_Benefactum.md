[EOH Name]
Benefactum "Bene"

[One line description]
A cold-blooded lamia who found two loves to warm her up on lonely nights. She has plans to establish a kingdom in the frigid north and to bring into being an inordinate amount of children.

[Personality]
Business-oriented, training-obsessed, and eager to learn. Prude. Tends to use formalities when appropriate. Takes on a more masculine demeanor when working, while being Feminine in demeanor during all else.

[Backstory]
Born in a high-tier dungeon along with her imoutos, where the three were left at an orphanage within a remote village. The orphanage's staff begrudgingly accepted the trio, what with their appearances, yet were often times neglected or demeaned by bullies. Eventually, Bene's Squire came along to adopt them and the group promptly left for the Wilds to live off the land. Their endeavor proved fruitless, as both the flora and fauna were too vicious for them to handle, but they soon found refuge within a dungeon nearing the tundra of Arpeggio, where they came to flourish in their new environment.

[Goals]
Aspires to make many life-long friends, found her own country, and become strong enough to defend what she loves.

Joking aside, I'd really prefer things to be sillier.

[Lewd Okay?]
It is fine.

#### Acquired Items
**'The Classic'**
A relatively-normal fishing pole in all but its superior make, allowing it to withstand the tug of most denizens lurking in Harahel's waters.
**Rubber Ducky**
A bath toy in the shape of a cartoonish water fowl. Squeezing it emmits a squeaking sound for all to hear, as well as a calming aura for the one who squeezes it. Thoughtfully named "Duximilian VII".
**Pink Towel**
This rosy-hued towel is imbued with an enchantment to accentuate the wearer's curves, but has a tendency to reveal what it hides by parting slightly or outright sliding off!
**Coin of Cadenza**
An intricate and ornate coin bestowed by the ruler of Cadenza, Queen Adalinda Tiamat, which boldly declares its owner being part of Her Majesty's royal hoard. The holder of such a token has some degree of respect from Cadenza's citizens. (Now void)
**Pumpkin Seeds (Tentacle Flora)**
Dozens of pumpkin seeds acquired from a pumpkin patch tainted by Onoskelis' lewd influences. Grow best when given ample arka derived from sexual fluids. When maturing or near maturity, these pumpkins are capable of exuding an aphrodisiac mist smelling of pumpkin spice, while their vines are now thicker, more durable, tendril-esque, and have a tendency to assail those nearby if in need of arka.

#### Acquired Companions
**Betta**

#### Base Appearance
**Head**
Instead of hair, numerous fine, spaghetti strands of scaled serpents erupt from the lamia's scalp, each with the very same hue as the rest of her reptilian features, and reaching down to just below the shoulders—save the gravity-defying cowlick that often sways to whims of its owner's emotions.
Two smooth, front-swept, ivory horns adorn the gorgon's head at an angle resembling a wreath crown. The pointed ends jut out a good three inches (7.62 cm) beyond her forehead and taper abruptly.
Benefactum's girlish face is smooth to the touch, including the fine, teal flakes of scales beneath her eyes and those in greater frequency towards her ears.
Her ears are finned, retractable, and of a darker tone than the majority of her body, while being reminiscent of some mermaids. They have a tendency to shift about or even flap, depending on the krait's emotions, calling to mind a trait of elves.
Her eyes are rather unremarkable, spare their reptilian pupils and iris' beautiful, rosy-pink hue.
Within this selachian's maw, lies a lengthy tongue typical of her kind, yet her teeth—fangs, in this case—are enlongated, due to partial Vampiric heritage. These dentures, however, are not of the same length as a full vampire, though manage to retain the same associated sharpness.
**Chest**
Light and sparse scale freckling patterns Benefactum's chest, while her large breasts remain unblemished, their size belying the musculature that lies beneath.
**Back**
The melusine's wings, rather than being higher on her back, are situated more towards the lower back—reasonably above her hips, yet are still classified as hip wings. The retractable appendages themselves are a shade of aqua, albeit a much darker variant. The coloration may, in part, be due to mixed ancestry.
Although they are wings by technicality—flapping and gliding is viable—their primary function serves to assist in swimming.
**Arms**
This naga has four muscle-laden arms, each with scales spanning from her shoulders-down. The pattern present is a simple one and mirrors her tail's, but only in greater frequency. Each five-fingered hand is equipped with keen, retractable claws.
**Tail**
Benefactum's tail would be a solid turquoise throughout, if not for the dark-black, banding pattern spaced equidistantly, where said pattern strays from the anal plate onwards. The tail tapers into a paddle-like and vaguely heart-shaped tip, which is wholly black and surprisingly sensitive. The belly of her tail is segmented and a pallid yellow.
**Miscellaneous**
Her skin is smooth and silky, while her scales feel soft and pliable.
