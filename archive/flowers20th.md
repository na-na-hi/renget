A sophomore in art university. Since Suoh is a book-lover, she has thought about how best she could have a career that have something to do with her passion, preferably a book designer, thus she decided to go study at an art university to learn the basics of design.
With this newfound path in mind, she made a choice to go to the same art university with Mayuri. Aside from striving to be a book designer, it's also her dream to be a librarian in the near future, and as such, she undertakes courses to qualify for both.

She's acquaintances with a female librarian, and is making a living by working part-time at a bookstore.
It's embarrassing, but the regular customers called her by the nickname "Ms. Fairy".
In addition, she's currently living in a 2DK apartment with her beloved Mayuri.

## Kohsaka Mayuri

A sophomore in art university. Goes to the same university with Suoh. Since Mayuri chose to focus on the oil painting course, whereas Suoh chose design, there are times their schedule don't overlap with each other. Yet the fact that they were able to chase their dreams while still being on the same campus is enough for them to be over the moon.

Seeing how she was already a member of the art club back at St. Angraecum, Mayuri chose to further her study in mastering professional oil painting. And although she intended to have a career related to design in the near future, she has been thinking of opening her own exhibition with the paintings she has worked on.

She works part-time at a caf√©, making best use of her skills in baking sweets.
She searched for somewhere she and Suoh could live together. Of course they truly want to live with each other, but the reduced living expenses is also a big reason.

It's a secret, but she has sketches of Suoh's sleeping face and the likes.

## Hanabishi Rikka

A sophomore in the department of education. Having been under the teachings of Sister Basquiat back at St. Angraecum, Rikka was impressed with the concept of education, thus she chose to also walk the path of a teacher.
In the career consultation, she told Sister Basquiat about her choice, and the latter gently gave her the push that she needed.

As a result, she, Suoh and Mayuri were separated. Due to the distance, the three of them can only meet once a year, but they still write each other letters, so the loneliness isn't too unbearable.
Moreover, one of the reasons that contribute to her feeling less lonely is because of Tsuwabuki Chika, who happened to be in the same department as her.
In addition, Hokama Mizuki has enrolled in College of Music, aiming to become a pianist.
Since the three of them happen to be in relatively close proximity with each other, they often host tea parties.

Although it's the same love triangle, to Rikka, this relationship and the comfort it brought felt like it is becoming another precious source of emotional support for her, just like that of Suoh and Mayuri's.

Upon graduating, she told Erika about her dream, to which the latter confessed that she wished for Chidori to go ahead and wait for Erika to make good on that dream of hers.
At that time, for the sake of realizing their dreams, they could hardly meet each other.
They miss the time spent with such detours.

But at last, Erika kept true to her words and returned to Chidori's side.
The two of them are aiming for the world.

As a result of heeding Sister Basquiat's suggestion, after graduating from St. Angraecum, Ichigo applied to a photography school. When it comes to finding purposes in life, she has no qualm about limiting her choices.
While taking baby steps into the world of photography, the wheel of fate began to turn for Ichigo, having met and received guidance from her lecturer - who was also a school alumna.

The pictures "she" took left an impact on Ichigo. Despite using the same camera to take pictures just like how the woman would, she can't recreate the same results.
The feelings Ichigo had for the woman were something more special than just admiration for her skills in photography.
She wanted to get closer to the woman, to talk with her more, and to spend as much time with her as she could.

After graduating from photography school, she continues to be the woman's assistant and keeps taking pictures every day.

## Sasaki Ringo

A sophomore in art university. Goes to the same art university as Suoh and Mayuri. She's aiming to be a children's book author and is studying hard in design in the department of fine arts.
Ever since she was little, she loved to daydream. The influence of reading books has spurred her on wanting to expand her own stories and write new works.

Differently from the time she was a student at St. Angraecum, she was finally able to choose her own path without relying on her older sister Ichigo.

It was not coincidence that she went to the same university with Suoh and Mayuri; it was Sister Basquiat who encouraged her. "It's important for one to pursue their dreams, but it's more important to have friends by your side." She might have made many more new friends in a new environment, but even so, surely what matters the most is the presence of her old friends that made her heart felt at ease.
Ringo really loves that gentle aspect of Sister Basquiat.

Right now, she's invested in making a picture book for a competition.
