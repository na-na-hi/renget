-> ***discord will be removing the file
hosting capabilities of their links in 2024 ,
which is why I highly recommend you to
save any pixels from resource carrds & rentries
that use links from discord before then.*** <-

-> *all images in this rentry have [postimages](https://postimages.org) links ,
so you don't need to save anything from here !* <-

-> this **only** affects discord links on **external websites** ,
**not images in discord servers/dms** so you don't need
to worry about those ^^ <-
