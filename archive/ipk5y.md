Ame…did you notice it? I wonder…what will you choose. I stay outside on the deck, staring at the horizon that Ame was staring at earlier. What does she see that I don’t. How do you see the world differently from me?

“Kronii? Are you in here?” I hear Ame shout inside, she’s outside my bedroom door! Oh…I’m nervous…my chest gets tight; my breaths get shorter. Why are you so nervous? We’ve done this before…Just…like any other time…just ask her…
I freeze time and head inside. Yeah there she is, standing in front of my door. I head to my room and enter. Just let her in and chat. That’s it…it’s really easy Kronii. Remember Fauna’s advice, just talk to her. Not as the lord of time, but as her friend. No titles. Just Ame and I. I open my mouth to shout back to Ame…but I chicken out at the very last second…I can’t! I’m too embarrassed. I…I don’t know what to do! I let time resume and sit in silence for a few moments.

*Knock Knock Knock* “Kronii? Are you ok?”  She’s right there Kronii! You can’t keep her waiting all day! Ok…OK! I’ll…I’ll stop time again and tell her! It’ll warm me up to this. I take a deep breath and freeze time again. I get up and open the door and whisper into her ear, “Come inside detective.” I run back into my room and sit back on my bed. Oh my god that sounds so stupid, why did I say that? I should’ve said something cooler…No…ugh…maybe I should turn time back and retry that…Just stick with it…

I let time resume, just stay committed…wait for her answer Kronii. 
“Alright I’m opening the door.” She replied, Ame replied. Oh gawd…I can’t…I can’t… I stare at the door watching the knob. No…no! I freeze time again. I get up and leave the room, I walk down the hall and stare at Ame from afar. I’m just…I can’t…I’m such a mess inside. I’m…I’m afraid of revealing my feelings for her… I don’t…want to hurt the relationship we’ve built…I don’t want to her to suffer this feeling when I…when she becomes…
*Creeeeeaaaaakkkkkk*
Huh?! She! She moved the door! She moved in frozen time! You’ve…you’ve improved Ame. I slowly sneak my way back to my room. Breathe Kronii. Just breathe. Ok. You'll know if she does or doesn't want to, she'll let you know. Confidence! 

I walk inside and look at Ame. She smiles at me and begins to open her mouth. I place my left index finger against my mouth. “Shhhh.” I move towards her and push her down onto the bed. She stays silent as she moves to lay down. I slither down and wrap myself around her in a tender embrace. I pull her arms to the side up over her head and lock her hands into mine. I stare into her eyes, and she stares into mine. My heart is beating one hundred times a second. I lower my face to meet her and close my eyes. I split her lips apart, claiming them for myself. She tightens her grip around my hands. I tighten mine in return. The warm air from her nose gently running across my upper lip tickles me. I smile. She smiles. We share an eternal moment frozen in time. I pull my face away; strings of mixed saliva extend from my mouth and onto her face. 

I open my eyes back up, my heart throbbing, can she hear the beat of my passion? Ame keeps her eyes closed, but she turns her head to the right, extending her neck out. I oblige her and move my head down, assaulting her with small kisses on her neck. From top to bottom, *Chu Chu Chu.* I pull my tongue out and press it against the spot of the final kiss. I run my tongue up her neck, stopping at her chin. I move back in towards the same spot once more and bite her. I wrap my lips over as best I can, sealing my grip and sucking on her. “K-Kronii!” Ame moans out, my head gets light, all I can think about is how much I want to hear her give herself up to me. I want to hear her moan. 

I let go of her hands and bring them down to the bottom her pajama shirt. I start lifting it up, as we pull away from the kiss. Our hands separate as Ame pulls her top over her head and drops it to the side of the bed. Biting down on the lower right side of her lower lip, she starts to pull my top upwards. I lift my arms and let it be removed. She giggles…I giggle in return. I push my face into hers a third time, looking to claim her lips again. I wrap my arms around her, reaching back for the hooks that hide her chest away. Top, then bottom, she’s free now. Ame places her hands on my face, pushing me back, ending our kiss and pulling herself up and away. 

Ame removes her bra and starts pulling down her pants and underwear together. I place my hands on my body, removing my own bra. She crawls over to me, pointing her ass up and outward. She takes my pants and panties off in the same stroke. We toss all of the clothes to the side, and I brush my body into hers, laying her back down. I wrap my lips around her right chikubi. My tongue running circles around her areola, my teeth gently nibble on her nipple. “Ah” A faint sound escapes Ame, she’s trying hard to keep silent. That won’t do. I press down onto my teeth, gripping her nipple with more pressure. “Ah…sh…shit…Kroniiiii…Not that haraarrrdddd!” She places her hands on my head and starts petting me. Her hands run through my hair, and I feel even closer to her now. “If that was too hard…I suppose I can give you a little break.”

I lift my mouth away from her chest and start heading south. I set kisses down her chest and tummy until I run into her lightly furred kitty and grin. This will be the second pair of lips I'll be splitting tonight Ame~ Slowly, I spread her lower lips from the top with two of my fingers. Grool drips out of the bottom and onto my bed sheets. A bright tone of pink sears itself into my memories.  “D-don’t look! Don’t look directly at it! It’s embarrassing Kronii!!!” I lift off of her pussy and insert my left index finger into my mouth, getting it soaked in my spit. I do this all in Ame's view, “Just sit back and relax, let me take care of you for once.”  I insert my index finger inside of her. Ame’s warmth…it's... The warmth of her body wraps my finger and the feeling shoots throughout my body. My heart flutters at the feeling. From head to toe I have goosebumps. I gently start pushing it in and out of her. “Hnngghh. P-please…take care of m-me then” 

I keep a steady rhythm and decide to start eating her out. I push my mouth onto the roof of her hood. My lips wrap around her most delicate part with my free arm constricting around her bubbly booty. I sneak my tongue inside, rubbing her hidden bean. I feel her love juices pour out of her and onto my hand. Her breaths become more and more labored in between her quiet moans. “Kronii…p-please…a bit more…don’t s-stop…” Ame says with a shaky, sultry voice. She grabs my hair and pulls on my head; it makes me happy. I purse my lips, starting to suck on her clit. As quick as she grabbed my hair she lets go and starts pushing my head into her crotch. Her panting gets louder and louder. I tighten my grip around her fluffy bottom, now greedily stealing handfuls of her big ass. She beings to rub her hips into my face, very intent on making me finish the meal I started. “K-Kroniii! You….you’re….I’m….I’m…gonna cum!” I keep my lips tight, sucking on her most sensitive spot. My finger keeps its pace. “Cum Ame! Let it out!”

“Kyaaaaaaaa. Haaaaaaaaaaah. Haaaaaaaaaaah. K…Kronii…my….my god…” Ame lets herself go, the labors of my work splash onto my face and chest. I lift my lips off of her, pulling my finger out. I lift my face away from Ame’s pussy and stare at her. I can feel my hair weigh down on my face as I look into her eyes. She stares back, looking into mine. I raise my damp finger to her face and push it into her mouth. “Not God, but I do appreciate being called one.” I can feel her laughing as her tongue whisks around my finger. She opens her mouth; I can see the moist warm air escape her as my finger is freed. “Hehe…” A short and simple laugh is all she manages now, stretching her body out over my bed. I lay down next to her and stare at the ceiling, thinking. 


“This all happened while time was frozen, therefore it wasn’t recorded.”

“Ah…I see…probably for the best right?”

“That’s for you to say. I can’t tell you whether or not something you had done, did or didn’t have purpose.”

“That was a…a rather interesting thing we did there.”

“Yeah…yeah it was.”

“I uh…ahem…you know…” Ame awkwardly tries to force some conversation forward. She has been doing this all day...

I stare at Ame, surprisingly finding myself rather speechless at the situation. I look at the ceiling again for a bit and think. What the actual hell is happening right now? I clear my throat and start to speak, “You don’t need to say anything. We can just lay here and cuddle up. Or you can freak out in your head alone. I don’t mind either option really.” I lightly tease. I’m not in a much better situation either since my head was just in her crotch a minute ago but, I guess I want to let her know it’s ok to feel how she’s feeling right now.

“Why…why did you…we…I mean…did…ugh.” Ame pulls herself up to me, cozying up underneath my left arm against my boobs. Wow…it…it’s kinda different…being the bigger one….

“I guess…why…why me Kronii?” Ame says quietly.

“Why you huh… Well…I wanted to… I wanted to do this with you…Do I need an actual reason?” I reply looking away, trying to hide my face. Not that it will help with all the pounding my heart is doing in her ear right now.

“W-with me?!”

“With you.” 

“I…I don’t know what to say…”

“Sometimes you don’t need to say anything…feels like I’m running around in circles now…”

“Well you know…time is a flat circle!”

I stare at her in disbelief, what a lame joke. “I’m going to resume time now. Refrain from using anymore awful jokes please. I don't want them on the record”

“Right…ok…”

“You dork.” I whisper, snapping my fingers and letting time resume. The universe continues its schedule.

“Can we just…stay like this tonight Kronii? Just the two of us?”

“Sure…although... I would like to wash myself again. I didn’t think you were a squirter…” I say jokingly.

“…I didn’t KNOW I was a squirter…” Ame says in an embarrassed way.

“Oh god…I uhhhhh…hey how about that shower huh?” I avoid the topic completely; I think I’m dying of embarrassment for her on the inside now.

“Right! Yes! Let’s!” Ame jumps out of bed and heads to the washroom. I follow her shortly after grabbing a few towels. Ame gets everything started and we enter together, washing each other and hiding what evidence that may exist.

“Hey Kronii?”

“Yeah?”

Ame shifts her eyes left to right…what are you…




“Round two?”
