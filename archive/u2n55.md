A Wyrdeer Tale
Tags: Pokemon Legends: Arceus protagonist, Wyrdeer, restrained, rape, reference to Pasiphae myth

>I'm such an idiot
>Kamado warned me that not everyone on the Galaxy Expedition Team would accept me right away
>So I probably shouldn't have trusted that Survey Corps girl who was all too eager to show me how to collect Wyrdeer fur for the Supply Corps 
>Can't even remember her name, we only just met this morning -- I guess that should have been the red flag
>Said she would take me out to the Obsidian Fieldlands where rare and valuable but dangerous Wyrdeer can be drawn out with some cunning
>Wanting to know more, I followed her into the Deertrack Heights where she showed me an odd wooden contraption
>It looked like a Stantler constructed out of wood
>She explained that it was hollow on the inside and if I climbed in and used a special call, I'd be able to attract a Wyrdeer and sneak up close enough to snag some fur
>Didn't even ask how I'd move around with this thing, just bent over and climbed in through the hatch on the back like a moron
>There wasn't much room inside, I could only get my torso in and had to go arms-first which kept them practically immobile in front of me
>Noticed two pegs for handholds towards the front interior and tried to pull myself in farther, but it was too tight
>By the time I asked if I was doing this right, I felt rope tighten around one of my legs and then the other, tying them to the legs of the wooden replica
>"That was way too easy," I heard the girl say
>Thinking this was some kind of hazing prank, I laughed nervously and asked her what she meant
>She responded with a story

>"Long ago, well before the Galaxy Expedition Team was founded, survival often required sacrifice -- especially during the cold winter months"
>"During the harshest winter Jubilife had ever seen, a brave woman ventured out into the wilderness in search of a means to keep her people from freezing to death"
>"It was out here where she saw wild Stantler roaming and eventually crossed paths with a Wyrdeer, but was only able to retrieve a small lock of his fur"
>"Still, she brought it back to the village in triumph with a plan to obtain more"
>"She asked the village's most esteemed woodworker to build her a hollow replica in this very spot"
>Here the girl slapped the top of the contraption
>"Then she climbed inside and waited"
>"After almost two days, she was cold and hungry, but finally a Wyrdeer approached"
>At this point, I heard her move around to the back of the contraption
>"Taller than her at full height, he must have been an impressive sight as he mounted this thing with her inside, mistaking it for a female Stantler just as she'd hoped"
>I felt her grab my leggings and pull
>A chill ran through me as cold air stung my exposed nether region
>"It was another two days before he was done trying to breed her, and by then, enough fur had fallen loose for the village to collect and get them through the winter"
>I started struggling but could barely move, asking incredulously if she was really planning to leave me here to be raped by a wild Pokemon
>"It's nothing personal against you, really; I'm actually glad you joined the team so I can pass this job on to a new rookie"
>"But don't worry," she added, "I'll check on you tomorrow and let you out as long as you've attracted a lot of furry Wyrdeer by then!"
>"Given your track record, I'm expecting you to 'catch' at least three"
>I shouted at her as she left, then broke down and cried once I could no longer hear her footsteps
>This couldn't be real

>Hours later, my legs are starting to cramp, and I'm forced to face the fact that this is my cruel reality
>With my arms stuck, I can't even reach for my Pokeballs or Arc Phone, and there's no way anyone would hear me calling for help
>I didn't even bother to tell anyone else that we were coming out here, and I can only assume that backstabbing bitch won't either
>With nothing else to do, I start screaming at Arceus for sending me through the space-time rift until my throat is raw
>But as the sun dips below the horizon, a new fear quiets me
>Besides Wyrdeer, there are many other wild Pokemon roaming the Fieldlands and the villagers' warnings about their dangers echo in my head
>I can barely see out of my wooden prison, but that ghostly glow approaching through the dark is hard to miss
>Could it be?
>The sound of crunching snow draws nearer, interspersed with occasional snorts
>Sometimes all other sounds stop altogether and only rough scratching is audible
>Eventually the Pokemon passes close enough that I can glimpse a hoof and gray-white fur
>It really is a Wyrdeer! My screaming must have lured it out
>I don't know how to feel about this
>That is, until the wooden Stantler starts to creak and groan under a great weight, and then I settle on panic
>"No! Go away! I'm not a Pokemon!" I shout desperately, but apparently adult Wyrdeer are not frightened by a young girl's voice
>I try to shift myself out of the way as much as possible, but my legs are stuck fast and there's hardly a few centimeters of wiggle room within the confines of this... breeding mount
>Only now does the true purpose of this contraption finally sink in and open up a chasm in my stomach, through which I can feel my heart plummeting
>Nononono this can't happen this can't--
>The chaotic firing of my thoughts all grind to a halt as something warm probes against my vulva
>Nooooo!
>The whole mount rocks forward 

>At first, the only thing I can focus on is the feeling of something tearing as pain lances through my belly
>My breaths form a thick cloud as I gasp raggedly, trying to fight down nausea amidst the agony and fear
>Only distantly rationalize that it was probably my hymen that tore and not something more vital
>The mount rocks again and I'm not nearly ready for it
>It knocks the breath out of me so I can't even scream, penetrating deep, deep inside me
>Can already feel blood dripping down one leg
>Whether the Wyrdeer thinks he's mating with a Stantler or a human, he seems satisfied with me and commences rutting
>My fingers curl white-knuckled around the hand pegs, but it doesn't help
>While still the thickest thing I've ever had inside me, his girth isn't the worst part, but his length...
>Whenever he thrusts particularly deep, I feel him jab something that causes my whole body to tense up in pain and nearly throw up
>Is this why Arceus brought me here? So a wild Pokemon can ruin my womanhood?
>After just minutes, I'm reduced to a babbling wreck, begging for my mom, professor Laventon, Kamado, Cyllene, and even Rei to come save me
>The longer it goes on, I can almost feel the tip of his member flaring upward, scraping harshly along my inner walls
>Before I pass out, a minor blessing is bestowed upon me and my violator's thrusts start to slow down
>With one final, powerful ram, he plants himself firmly in the deepest part of me
>The force of his ejaculation is like repeated punches to my cervix and seems to last as long as the coitus did
>It's too much and I finally heave the contents of my stomach onto the ground -- luckily the bottom of the breeding mount is open
>Pump after pump of hot, gross Pokemon cum squelches inside of me until it's dripping down the front of my belly
>If I hadn't thrown up already, I would be sick now

>At long last he dismounts, his terrifying length making a wet suction sound as it slowly retracts until the flared tip catches on my lips and pops out with a final, painful tug
>The ordeal leaves me choking on broken sobs, empty on one end and full on the other
>He spends a while cooing and rubbing up against the Stantler mount almost as if to console me, although it's probably just more mating behaviour
>I don't have the energy to try shooing him away anymore
>By the time his semen has stopped draining from my womanhood, I feel him trying to mount again
>I redouble my thrashing against the wood entrapping me, banging and scraping until my hands and elbows are bruised
>"Stop! Stop! I can't do it! No more!"
>He enters me easily this time, my passage already loosened and lubricated by the previous session
>"Yahhh!!"
>As my whole body clenches up, my feet leave the ground and knees knock against the underside of the breeding mount, instinctively curling into a fetal position
>Despite coming once already, his thrusts are relentless, displaying the incredible stamina of this great beast
>Each time he rears back for another thrust, my womanhood clenches hard around his member like that could stop it from invading further
>Then his bulk shifts and I'm forced open again by his immense strength, reminding me of how truly weak and defenseless I am
>Suddenly, several hazy images intrude upon my thoughts
>Being tied up and gangbanged by all the members of Survey Corps
>Presenting myself willingly to a wild Wyrdeer
>Lying spent in a pool of semen
>As each one appears in my mind's eye, a faint glimmer of pleasure sparks in my loins
>"No!"
>I violently thrust the thoughts away, horrified
>I don't want this, I don't want this, I don't...
>Sore, panting, and humiliated, I wail in despair as the Wyrdeer sprays his seed into me again
>More than ever, I wish for this hell to end
>And that's when I hear a new set of hooves arriving

>By morning, my inner thighs are coated with a slush of frozen semen
>It crackles as I restlessly shift my numb legs to get some feeling back into them
>The sound of more footsteps barely registers in my exhausted brain until a familiar voice joins them
>"Well, would you look at all that fur! This should last us quite a while! I knew you were made for this job"
>I merely groan in response
>"Yeah, they're rough, aren't they? Now, out you go"
>She finishes untying my legs and tries to catch me as I crumple to the ground
>I just lie there while she collects the fur into a canvas bag, most of it shed from the Wyrdeer's beard onto the wooden Stantler's neck and back
>I also notice that the spine is cleverly lined with short bristles like a wire brush to help with collection
>With a hiss, I gently reach down to feel around my tender womanhood, the lips raw and puffy, coagulated blood and semen caked on and streaking my legs
>There's a lot of blood and my internal organs feel bruised, but I'm alive
>Can't believe I survived the night
>"Okay, that oughta do it -- woah, they really did a number on you, huh? C'mon, I'll help you walk back."
>The way she's acting so chummy after what she put me through makes me furious
>But as much as I want to push her away, I know I'm not going anywhere alone, so I let her get an arm under my shoulders and pull me shakily to my feet
>"Can you walk if you lean on me?"
>I nod and we start in the direction of Jubilife village
>"So, how many ended up coming by?"
>"...Three," I croak out
>"Ah-ha, your lucky number!"
>I want to bite back at the comment, but the sun feels pleasant and by noon I'll be back in my soft bed, so I just let it slide
>Although there's one thing I have to ask, even as shame burns under my skin
>"S-So... Are there, um... Any other Pokemon that need harvesting?"
>She throws her head back at the bright blue sky and cackles
