# Norquinal's Bots

[TOC3]

###What's a Recommended Platform?
It's somewhat self-explanatory, but the recommended platform delineates which AI service/model I feel is best at capturing the character's personality and behavior on a general basis. I will put "Either" if feel that all platforms are comparable. I might even include little explanations for why I make certain ratings. Individual mileage may vary, of course. Ratings aren't absolute and are subject to change.

### Suggestions
I enjoyed making bots. I don't enjoy it as much as I used to, but if you have any ideas for a bot you think would be cool, or how I could improve a bot, or otherwise any comments or feedback, I'm always open to hearing them. I lurk the threads pretty regularly, so just mentioning by name is enough to get my attention. Maybe I should open a google form for suggestions as well? I don't know.
