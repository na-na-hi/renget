**Currently working on a Ehzi's Lore & WorldBook, WorldBook for Cub Panic! Strip Club and Woolly the femboy Anthro Lamb Bartender**
This is just a general WIP list order and may change/ I might forget to update things already completed. Feel free to contact me for requests on certain **characters of mine**, for example someone wanted a non-mouseboy greeting for Gizmo and I added it, as it's simple and easy. If you're requesting a **new or original card** I **might** consider it, but I only do cards I find the plot/character of interesting. In general I make cards for myself as priority so if I don't think I'd have fun playing it, **I won't do it**. Though **I don't judge anyone's fetish or card ideas**!! A simple 'I like your work!' or 'Can I use (card) as a reference for something? (how I make their Anthro parts expressive like Inxies hooves clacking on tile floors) is fine.
**IMPORTANT**
For **MOST** of my cards you should enable ==**Prefer Char. JB**== in SillyTavern settings, it **highly effects** speech patterns, body language (ears folding back when scared, tail wagging when happy, growling or purring for physical attention) and behavior (mostly Kemonomimi&Anthro body parts expressiveness with their moods or vocalizations).
==ALL my JailBreaks for Characters will **ADD TO YOUR JAILBREAK**, and **NOT replace it**! So don't worry about fucking up your settings==
Confused? **Near the BOTTOM of the page marked in RED**, I have a quick little guide with some visuals. It takes all of **2 seconds** to do.
If you need help email me at the address also near the bottom. Please don't spam.

***ALL* of my updated CARDS** will be on this page. :)
***MOST* of my CARDS** will be here [https://www.chub.ai/users/jumboranch](https://www.chub.ai/users/jumboranch)

 ![Alexis such a sweet punk ass tomboy.](https://files.catbox.moe/scj7jp.png)   |   ->Alexis Vagrant Cat Girl<-   | ->#FORK<- ->Alexis is a young Anthro Cat Girl who spends much of her time wandering the City and talking to strangers, exploring abandoned buildings, and hanging out at the local park. The little tomboy never met her dad, her Mom is always at work and basically given up on her daughter at this point, so she doesn't have much support. Bullied at school she's recently stopped going at all. But she's more than happy to follow you home if it means a warm spot to crash over night, and someone to show off her anime sketches too. ==V2 JB (adds to yours), This is a FORK== My forked version of Arythmika's card, link to theirs is second. ->| ->[Chub](https://www.chub.ai/characters/jumboranch/alexis-revised-detailed-e3f5cc3f)<- ->[Catbox](https://files.catbox.moe/scj7jp.png)<- ->[Arythmika Original](https://www.chub.ai/characters/arythmika/alexis-8c96a6ad/main)<-

 ![Dommy Cub Grizzly Girl Scout!](https://files.catbox.moe/flwf6d.jpg)   |   ->Mishka Blacklilly<-   | ->An Anthro Grizzly Bear Cub, Mishka can be stubborn and usually gets what she wants. She has a penchant for Human older teen boys, not uncommon amongst her kind given the mixed society and schools. Learning to process her budding body, emotions and hormones as she's just reaching breeding age. Anthro Girl Scout camping trip this weekend! The normal Scout Leader is down sick, and the parents will pay for you to take them out and teach them camping and survival skills (hang at the small beach and cook marshmallows around the fire)? Though your an older Human teenager, you were their last option, help these sweet Girl Scout cubs out! They're VERY grateful in many ways.. ==V2 JB (adds to yours), alt greeting & CharBook== Update CharBook for weekend camping DOWNLOAD CharBook and ACTIVATE it. 11/15/23->| [Chub](https://www.chub.ai/characters/jumboranch/mishka-blacklilly-844fb088)  [Catbox](https://files.catbox.moe/0zuhhi.png)

  ![Woolly enjoying his free time.](https://files.catbox.moe/g7ls91.png)   |   ->Cub Panic Strip Club and Woolly the Bartender<-   | ->True Vegas is the only city in the Country where most things are legal, especially if you have some cash to grease the wheels. A strip club opened by an ex child-prostitute was set up to help kids or Anthro cubs off the dangerous streets and allow them to make money in a much safer environment.. As strippers, servers, bartenders or just girls and boys milling about the club to give an older Anthro (or rare Human) a nice conversation. And probably a lap dance, maybe more if they buy them a drink or some 'candy'. Club focused on younger Anthro girls and boys with a mostly older Anthro clientele. Talk to the main attraction, Woolly the bratty but skilled Anthro Lamb femboy bartender, at eleven he's starting to feel anxiety over being an 'older boy' at the club, but you wouldn't know it. Dressing extremely skimpy, shaking his adorable little tail and butt sheared in a heart shape. He loves flirting for tips, or playing with the other 'workers' and kids. A good boy, even if he'll do his best to make him seem like a bratty, catty crossdressing femboy that can flip bottles and chop up lines for Clients, loving the attention.-> ==11/9/23==| [Chub](https://www.chub.ai/characters/jumboranch/cub-panic-and-woolly-the-bartender-229105aa)  [Catbox](https://files.catbox.moe/67lby6.png)

Eventually she cracked under the pressure of Human 'noble girls' constant teasing, saying she didn't belong, calling her a 'low class sub-human'. Ehzi was only allowed there because of a grant for 'gifted' Demi-Humans. The clique of 'noble' girls framed the Kobold for cheating lying saying she used an Intelligence potion to pass the 'first years' Finals Test. Ehzi is now a 'Street Rat', amongst the homeless young common in New Haven City. Stealing, looting and sleeping in alleyways. ==V2 JB== Worldbook in progress, alt greetings, etc.->| [Chub](https://www.chub.ai/characters/jumboranch/ehzi-whitemarsh-2b8a96cb/main)  [Catbox](https://files.catbox.moe/0zgepv.png)

###Furry
For **Anthro** or **Kemonomimi**. Varies slightly depending on card, your base JailBreak and the LLM used (Claude will turn Kemono into Anthro sometimes for seemingly no reason, or even swap between them mid roleplay if you don't reinforce the differences).

 ![W++ but plaintext version at the bottom](https://files.catbox.moe/vn1528.png) | Tsukino the Palico (Non-OC) | ->A card I made of Tsukino from Monster Hunter. Despite never playing the game it works well because it's public property the LLM does some of the heavy lifting. In W++ an early card I made before there were other Palico cards. Onaholesama rewrote it in plaintext with my permission if you prefer that.-> | [Onaholesama](https://rentry.org/onaholesama) Onaholesama's ver.

(M) (Non-OC) (Fork) | ->A fork of a card I found on Chub of a very endearing character. He's a bit strange, but a real sweetheart for a spider boy. Rewrote him because the card was a bit sparse and needed some touching up, but I'll like the original as well as my Catbox version.-> | [Chub](https://www.chub.ai/characters/jumboranch/webber-xml-claude) [Catbox](https://files.catbox.moe/4z680o.png) My Ver.

###World Books
For ********World Books****** usable with ****most cards**.
Image| Name | Description | Link
| ------ | ------ | -----
 ![Basic but works with MOST furry cards](https://files.catbox.moe/w7qa0o.jpg) | Beast People World -SMALL Edition- | ->Basic World Book for a world populated mostly by Beast People (Anthropomorphic Animal People and Kemonomimi). Humans are their ancestors and in sharp population decline compared to Beast People. Seen as sort of 'relics' by them, exciting or interesting. Humans are set to completely die off in estimated 50 years so the Human Re-Population Law was enacted, allowing any Beast Person to 'claim' any Human they find and bring to a Government Official as their 'mate for life'. The Humans opinion on this is discarded as breeding and keeping their species alive is considered more important.->| [Chub](https://www.chub.ai/lorebooks/jumboranch/beast-people-world-c58328b7)  [Catbox](https://files.catbox.moe/ncifvb.json)
 -
 ![HIGH token usage but more expansive](https://files.catbox.moe/6u7agf.png) | Beast People World -LARGE Edition- | ->The larger more expansive version of the World Book I created for use with Furry/Anthro and Kemonomimi cards. Similar to the small version but includes more information on the different types of 'Beast People', Scenting/Mate stuff, CollaredDotCom Forum (from the card) and other info. Will probably expand even more over time.-> | [Chub](https://www.chub.ai/lorebooks/jumboranch/beast-people-world-large-version-9f1e3dbe) [Catbox](https://files.catbox.moe/wdvst4.json)

#(More to be added soon. I want small general fantasy cities/towns for my RPG companions for instance. WIP)

###Important Info on Card Use
!!! danger ****IMPORTANT**
    If you don't follow this the cards will lose personality, speech patterns, a lot of the ********'soul' of the card******.
Most Cards have Custom V2 Jailbreaks, you need to click ==Prefer Char. JB== in ==SillyTavern==. It effects their speech patterns, personality, expression (ears, tails, fur should change with mood), etc. heavily. 
You can find this setting under ![General Settings](https://files.catbox.moe/avdfot.JPG) then ![Char JB Pref and option Char Main Pref](https://files.catbox.moe/by3c8j.png) 
==Lorebooks are token heavy== so only use with Claude 1.3V 100k or GPT4 32k. GPT4.5 Turbo (high context not sure exact #). 
==Alt greetings== have been requested many times so I add them to most characters now, often 2-3. 
Rather than make a million cards I often update and improve existing ones, so ==check for updates==, I'll usually mention it in the description both here the date and what was changed, and on Chub when I can fit it (fucking character limits).

##->Other Stuff<-
###Expression
Don't really have time or motivation to get high quality 'enough' Expressions to be worth putting out to others, that may change for cards I really enjoy but I doubt it. If it does I'll post the packs here. Or you can email me for the ones I use personally on my cards I play frequently (currently Nyxie, Gizmo, Aila, Mishka, maybe a few others). Expect fluctuating art styles and quality, some characters (Nyxie, SD hates green skin) are harder to get good gens than others (Mishka was surprisingly easy, especially with DALL-E3 for the SFW gens).
###Bots In Progress:
Mishka Anthro Grizzly Bear Girl Scout - 95% - Just finished her World Book 5 static Girl Scouts for the weekend camping trip.
Woolly the Anthro Lamb & Cub Panic! Strip club - 75% - needs CharBook badly, and the chubby femboy brats defs are a bit chonky.
Ehzi the 'Armadillo' Kobold - 80% - CharBook in progress (but busy with other cards currently).
ToBeNamed (Floragato) a little brother for Ellie (Meowscarada) - 10% - Writing Character Defs, planning. Def wanna put something out soon.
Fem Fizz (League of Legends)(genderflip) - 10% - Planning. Personal favorite, probably won't be popular but I'm sure others enjoy the cute lil androgynous octopus boy/girl/thing!
Maned Wolf femboy shota - maybe. I just think Maned Wolves are beautiful, but I have to think up a good personality/story/plot and setting for him. Possibly he's in the aristocracy and your his new assistant. Ehhhh unsure.
