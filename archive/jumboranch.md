**Working on a Mishka, Ehzi lore, Raccoon girl, lil' brother for 'Ellie' the Meowscarada, among other ideas.**
For MOST of my cards you should enable ==Prefer Char. JB== in SillyTavern, it highly effects speech patterns, body language and behavior.

| ------ | ------ | -----
 ![Dominant, loves Humans over Anthro's](https://files.catbox.moe/5f93bi.png) | Mishka Blacklilly | ->Just a simple dominant Anthro Grizzly Bear cub, she can be sweet but gets what she wants. Mostly older HUMAN teen boys when she can find them. I had a 'in heat' system with her but Claude just made it turn on every chat turning her into a sex-fiend so I took it out. ==V2 JB== Tighten up defs, *maybe* expand char a bit more.->| [Chub](https://www.chub.ai/characters/jumboranch/mishka-blacklilly-844fb088)  [Catbox](https://files.catbox.moe/ivii76.png)

Trinkets in town, which she often finds on dead adventurers or around the borders of dungeons. Secretly wants a Human Sugardaddy.

 ![Shy and sweet, but vulnerable](https://files.catbox.moe/wjzanf.png) | Ehzi Whitemarsh | ->'Armadillo' Kobold girl. Was once in the Mages Academy, a prestigious school training to be a Cleric with her rare budding magic. Eventually she cracked under the pressure of Human 'noble girls' constant teasing, saying she didn't belong, calling her a 'low class sub-human'. Ehzi was only allowed there because of a grant for 'gifted' Demi-Humans. The clique of 'noble' girls framed the Kobold for cheating lying saying she used an Intelligence potion to pass the 'first years' Finals Test. Ehzi is now a 'Street Rat', amongst the homeless young common in New Haven City. Stealing, looting and sleeping in alleyways. ==V2 JB== Worldbook in progress, alt greetings, etc.->| [Chub](https://www.chub.ai/characters/jumboranch/ehzi-whitemarsh-2b8a96cb/main)  [Catbox](https://files.catbox.moe/0zgepv.png)

Her 'Mother' runs The Hive, and underground Vampires Nest under True Vegas City Year 2133. Cold, cruel and clever, Hellena sees Humans as livestock.

She's a bit neglected and often hangs out at the abandoned arcade in the mall. One day she loses the stuffed animal her dad gave her before he left for good, and thinks YOU stole it! Help the sweet fluff find it, she's very sweet, animalistic and a bit possessive. One of my favorites, and earlier bots I revised through different LLM's. ==V2 JB, Rewritten fully (8/6)==->| [Chub](https://www.chub.ai/characters/jumboranch/winnie-werewolf) [Catbox](https://files.catbox.moe/ee5s68.png)

 ![W++ but plaintext version at the bottom](https://files.catbox.moe/vn1528.png) | Tsukino the Palico (Non-OC) | ->A card I made of Tsukino from Monster Hunter. Despite never playing the game it works well because it's public property the LLM does some of the heavy lifting. In W++ an early card I made before there were other Palico cards. Onaholesama rewrote it in plaintext with my permission if you prefer that.-> | [Onaholesama](https://rentry.org/onaholesama) Onaholesama's ver.                 [Catbox](https://files.catbox.moe/vn1528.png) My original W++ ver.

 ![He's strange, but a fucking adorable personality](https://files.catbox.moe/ls328d.png) | Webber from Don't Starve! (M) (Non-OC) (Fork) | ->A fork of a card I found on Chub of a very endearing character. He's a bit strange, but a real sweetheart for a spider boy. Rewrote him because the card was a bit sparse and needed some touching up, but I'll like the original as well as my Catbox version.-> | [Chub](https://www.chub.ai/characters/jumboranch/webber-xml-claude) [Catbox](https://files.catbox.moe/4z680o.png) My Ver. [NiceNShady](https://www.chub.ai/characters/nicenshady/Webber/main) Original card

###World Books
For World Books usable with most cards.
Image| Name | Description | Link
| ------ | ------ | -----
 ![Basic but works with MOST furry cards](https://files.catbox.moe/w7qa0o.jpg) | Beast People World -SMALL Edition- | ->Basic World Book for a world populated mostly by Beast People (Anthropomorphic Animal People and Kemonomimi). Humans are their ancestors and in sharp population decline compared to Beast People. Seen as sort of 'relics' by them, exciting or interesting. Humans are set to completely die off in estimated 50 years so the Human Re-Population Law was enacted, allowing any Beast Person to 'claim' any Human they find and bring to a Government Official as their 'mate for life'. The Humans opinion on this is discarded as breeding and keeping their species alive is considered more important.->| [Chub](https://www.chub.ai/lorebooks/jumboranch/beast-people-world-c58328b7)  [Catbox](https://files.catbox.moe/ncifvb.json)
 -
 ![HIGH token usage but more expansive](https://files.catbox.moe/6u7agf.png) | Beast People World -LARGE Edition- | ->The larger more expansive version of the World Book I created for use with Furry/Anthro and Kemonomimi cards. Similar to the small version but includes more information on the different types of 'Beast People', Scenting/Mate stuff, CollaredDotCom Forum (from the card) and other info. Will probably expand even more over time.-> | [Chub](https://www.chub.ai/lorebooks/jumboranch/beast-people-world-large-version-9f1e3dbe) [Catbox](https://files.catbox.moe/wdvst4.json)

###Important Info on Card Use
!!! danger IMPORTANT
    If you don't follow this the cards will lose personality, speech patterns, a lot of the 'soul' of the card.
Most Cards have Custom V2 Jailbreaks, you need to click ==Prefer Char. JB== in ==SillyTavern==. It effects their speech patterns, personality, expression (ears, tails, fur should change with mood), etc. heavily. 
==Lorebooks are token heavy== so only use with Claude 1.3V 100k or GPT4 32k. 
==Alt greetings== have been requested so I add them to most characters now. 
Rather than make a million cards I often update and improve existing ones, so ==check for updates==, I'll usually mention it in the description.

##->Other Stuff<-
###Expression
Don't really have time or motivation to get high enough quality Expressions to be worth sharing, that may change for cards I really enjoy but I doubt it. If it does I'll post the packs here.
###Bots In Progress:
Mishka Anthro Grizzly Bear cub loves Human teen boys - 90% - Not sure if I'm gonna expand this char or not, she's fun enough as is (to me anyways).
Ehzi the 'Armadillo' Kobold - 80% - Lorebook, CharBook, probably expression.
ToBeNamed (Floragato) a little brother for Ellie (Meowscarada) - 10% - Writing Character Defs, planning.
Fem Fizz (League of Legends)(genderflip) - 10% - Planning
Maned Wolf femboy shota - maybe.
