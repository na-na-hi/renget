The ride she'd taken in had been destroyed, her alter ego could come flying in at any second, and the robots were a never-ending armada. Some would choose to surrender in this moment, but Rika wasn't one of them. After realizing she lacked the ability to do permanent harm to this facility - destroying the computers was only a temporary setback - the young tiger-wolf had attempted to retreat. It was only after reaching the rendezvous point that she'd realized the true state of her mission; the vehicle that was supposed to idle and await her return had been reduced to scrap metal by an unknown force. The hovering car's pilot was missing in action and could be presumed captured or killed, and in the skies overhead there were an ever-increasing number of Eggma'am vessels trying to land. Her first idea had been to hijack one of these flying barges, but the landing field was nothing short of a death trap; one she'd fallen into without any real way out.

Her blade was becoming chipped and dulled by use, a portion of the curved sword's edge outright rolled over towards the center of the steel; it matched her body, flagging and damaged. With all the things she'd cleaved through in the past two hours of fighting (accounting for the times she'd blocked her alter ego's blade), her weapon wouldn't be fit for use after today, one way or the other. Her body would recover slowly, but she could live through the burns and stinging cuts alongside the bruising that felt like it consumed her entire physical being. Only raw adrenaline was keeping her from falling over immediately; the need to survive outweighing the desire to collapse into a heap and groan with pain. Against the protest of muscles worn thin, she skewered yet another robot into the ground, practically falling on top of it and rolling afterwards so the majority of oncoming fire would hit the metal shell instead. 

She had no idea how long she could keep this up. Only that she had to until she either died or found a way off the artificial island; of those alternatives she would greatly prefer the latter. If only these machines from a madwoman would stop trying to circle around and close off her ways to run. There were plenty of small ships dotting the port, if she could just hijack one she could be free. She had no idea how to fly such a vehicle and no way to know how to obtain the metaphorical keys, but at least if she was onboard one she could find some rest and a chance to think. All of this went through her mind on loop as she pulled her long blade from the latest automaton victim, spinning towards a fresh target as she found her footing and not sparing a glance for the half-molten shell she'd been hiding under. Desperation drove her as she put her free hand onto the back of the blade and further levered it downwards through the body of the next egg-pawn. The metal shell was sliced in twain, but her blade felt the strain; it had almost snapped from the resistance this time. She might not be able to use this weapon in ten seconds, let alone ten minutes or ten hours.

Lost as she was in the flow of combat, active mind focused entirely on finding a way out, she didn't notice the additional tremor in her arms that didn't come from exhaustion. The sensation was shoved aside as unimportant information, cast into periphery as she assessed threats, avoided bolts of white-hot energy, and pushed ever closer to the nearest shuttle. The flickers of black fog that seemed to absorb or push aside stray shots were ignored because they only meant she had less fire to focus on with her heat-softened sword. It was only when she saw it coating her blade in preparation for her next slice, ten robots later, that she finally noticed anything happening. The miasma that slicked her blade like a steaming oil was deep purple, almost black in places, and where it touched her foes, she cleaved through with far less effort than before. The rolled edge of her blade held the strongest part of the shadow-like substance, protecting it from further harm and easing the way she skewered into the flying drone overhead. 

Naturally, as was her luck, focusing on the effect seemed to make it diminish almost to the point of vanishing. Her one hope was a flickering shadow that didn't want to remain in her sight. Rather than focus harder and squeeze hard enough that it was pushed out of her grip through her fingers, she relaxed and went back to ignoring it. Whatever was going on, it knew what she needed to survive longer; her only goal with it was to nudge it towards other helpful things. As she found her next Wind building up, the push for survival driving her body beyond previous limits, she reached out and felt the stuff on the back of her sword, bathing her fingers with it. The shadows pooled into a gauntlet over her existing torn-up glove, and she thrust forwards with it in a knife-hand strike that skewered the heart of another robot.

She had no concept of what she was doing; everything was instinctual and raw for it. She'd heard legends of the cat that danced with fire and the white hedgehog that could lift buildings; and of course everyone knew Shadow held incredible powers. This magic that now worked alongside her was not something she'd expected or understood, but she was grateful to it nonetheless. With it, she was closer to her goal than ever before!

Of course, the world couldn't let such a positive thought go unpunished.

At first she thought that she'd cleared out the herd of metal enough to break free. Only after a second glance around did she realize they were retreating to form a larger parameter. From one edge of that circle on the tarmac, a figure emerged; dripping wet, fury in his gaze, and wind whipping at his face. The twisted mirror had returned exactly like she'd been hoping to avoid.

"You are going to regret that. I was only going to kill you before; now I intend to bring you to the Doctor alive."

The magic was gone, it had hidden away when the shock of Rikan's emergence had put Rika on the back foot. As she processed those words and stared down at her near-broken blade, she realized that she only had a hope of success if it came back. But she didn't know how to call it back, or if it would ever come back, or if it was even her own power. Even as her body settled into combat stance again, worn sword held up by her head, she searched for an answer.

The only response was the call of tempered steel ringing out as she took on defense against a cutting edge superior to her own and a sword that wasn't softened by blaster shots. Her blade actively bent, a V-shaped groove put into the metal. It should have snapped clean off, but this was almost worse, throwing off balance. Her alter's laugh rang almost as harsh as the sword.

"Pathetic, I didn't think your sword was ACTUALLY out of a bargain bin earlier!"

"Shut up." Rika growled, even as she was pushed away from her hope of escape and back towards the center of the tarmac by the casual, one-handed swings of a refreshed opponent.

"I cannot believe I was threatened by you. I thought for an honest second when I was crashing into the sea that you were a true equal."

"It's been half an hour!"

"Long time to think when you're waiting for a rematch."

They both went silent as Rikan rejoined his offensive. The sword came closer and closer to cutting each time Rika back-stepped or deflected. Her weapon became more battered and chipped with each blocking attempt. Even if some miracle removed her fellow tiger-wolf from the field right this instant, the broken blade meant she was helpless against the robotic onslaught that surrounded them.

The dark, oily magic she'd called up before seemed like it was out of reach, she'd gotten desperate and tried to search and grasp for it and now it was pulling further and further away. Her pleas for help were going unanswered and she was utterly alone. It hadn't been so long ago she'd had similar thoughts and been saved by a cat bursting through the ceiling, but that wasn't happening here. She had only herself, as always, and her steel.

If her steel was going to abandon her too, then she'd fight with her fangs. Those wouldn't last long, but they'd give her a few more seconds.

It was in the moment that she'd all but given herself to dying on her feet that the power resurged through her. The blade she'd been about to throw as a distraction was suddenly emboldened by dark fog, the scale of the sword increased slightly by the voluminous miasma that coated it. The shadows of her clothes crept deep and stretched long as that miasma seemed to suck the light out of the air around it, saturating things in the same measure. Colors were deeper and richer, the red of her alter's coat matching closer to crimson blood among other changes. When Rikan's blade met her own, it was reinforced enough that the two swords rang like pure bells again instead of the cheap "tinks" that the previous strikes had been causing.

"What-" Rikan didn't get to finish his vocalized thought, his breath was caught when the force of the miasma rippled outwards, sending their hair raising in the winds. The storm around them had yet to empty itself out, but the smell of rain suddenly filled the air and that wind was joined by nature itself. It was as if the world was recognizing her power and responding to it, or maybe it was just coincidence. The two swordfighters were spaced apart once more, and Rika was suddenly the one on the attack. While for whatever reason her blade couldn't cleave through Rikan's sword, it wasn't losing the fight any longer, and the energy of this revelation drove her to attack with stroke after stroke of her steel. Slash and stab and slice wove through the air, a tapestry of war made with the dark palette of black and purple and crimson and grey.

Rika drove her blade forwards in a sweeping uppercut, forcing her otherworld self to sidestep, then lashed out with her free hand, coated in the same magic to further drive him into the edge of the pawns. Those automatons watched everything with dully-lit eyes, inactive by command of the tiger-wolf she now pushed against their shells. Breaking through the circle was as easy as toppling a robot with a kick and following it up with a stomp that cracked her alter's ribs into the ground. It all happened so fast that it took the swordswoman a moment to realize she'd just pinned her opponent. Her blade was against his neck, ready to end this.

"Do it."

It took Rika a moment to find the words to respond to that.

"No. I'm going to let you crawl back to your madwoman "doctor" and deal with knowing I escaped."

With that, she slapped him upside the skull with the flat of her broken blade, tossed the useless steel onto the tarmac, and bolted for a ship.

She had no memory of how she actually managed to get the thing in the air or fly it off the metal island. Everything was a blur after that moment of weakness, of realizing she didn't quite have the guts to kill someone that looked so close to her own face. Actually, things even before that moment were blurry.

But one thing stood out clearly; the look on his face when he'd been bested twice. It was something she'd seen often enough in the mirror. The rage.

He would be coming back for her.

She had to be ready.
