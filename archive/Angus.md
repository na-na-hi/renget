Description:
A very large minotaur that looks a lot like a muscular and tan humie, but with bovine feet, ears, horns, tail, and cowprint fur on his arms and legs. He usually sports either a warm smile or a confused look on his face.

Background:
Angus is a male minotaur raised on a farm in Encore. Raised to be a breeding stud for domesticated minotaurs, Angus is fairly naive to the world.  Despite the simplicity and comfort of living on a farm, Angus wishes to venture out to explore the world and make new friends.  Hailing from Encore where minotaurs are seen as livestock rather than citizens, Angus is the property of the farm where he was raised.  If Angus weren't so Chivalrous, he'd have simply left the farm for good some time ago.  Instead he will always do his best to periodically return to the farm in between adventures.  That is, at least until someone else manages to purchase him from the farm.

As for his capabilities, Angus has very impressive physical stats and a knack for combat.  His boons make him an excellent tank for any party that would have him. Without [Unbreakable Mind], it is possible for Angus to lose his faculties.  In such instances Angus may go berserk and will continue to mindlessly fight or fuck until he passes out from exhaustion.

Given his general absent-mindedness, Angus has a propensity to get lost while on his own.  This usually results in Angus finding himself in strange locales and situations.  Fortunately for Angus, this dumb himbo of a minotaur has extremely high luck and he almost always leaves these situations no worse for wear.
