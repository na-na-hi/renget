**Yo,**

The species wildcards available on the main rentry weren't doing it for me, so i went full tismo and made my own.

https://files.catbox.moe/efllcw.zip

**ALL VERSIONS**
https://civitai.com/models/284107/e621-species-wildcards

Contents include 35 wildcard text files intended for use with SD Dynamic Prompts (A111 WebUI) 
Get that extension here: https://github.com/adieyal/sd-dynamic-prompts.git

##->**FEATURES**<-
- 232 different species pulled from the e621 database

- Focus on anthro content (no cyclops / gorgon / satyr etc.)
- Descriptive tags included for all species (big feet for frogs, quills for porcupines etc.)
- Colors & body sizes specified only when important for species identification/differentiation 
- Should be flexible for male/female/agender prompting, with a few exceptions (lion manes, antlers, udders)
- VBA enabled Excel file included with full database - script included can be used to update wildcards with your changes
- Database includes mostly accurate tag strengths for each species listed
- No LoRA dependecy, all prompts tested using EasyFluff

##->**IMPORTANT DETAILS**<-
- You need to specify a directory (edit the VBA code) for the script to work
- Don't fuck with the database columns, it'll break the script
- I suck at VBA, please be gentle
- The script will delete any files starting with "e621-" in the directory specified - be careful if you have other files starting with that
- So any new groups you add should also start with "e621-"
- The wildcards don't include backgrounds or poses, adjust your prompt accordingly 
- All prompts tested nude, but clothes should work fine. Certain parts of the wildcards may interfere with some clothing.
- Crustaceans, arachnids, tentacles, and slimes require a lot of prompt tuning to get right. Insects need a bit.

##->**FUTURE PLANS**<-
- I don't use ComfyUI. Not sure if this will work with it, but if you make something send me a catbox and I'll put it here.
- Will add additional species/modify tags on request
