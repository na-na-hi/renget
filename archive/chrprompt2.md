#Second (Official) Clover Guild Character Q&A

!!!Warning: Please write all entries into a text editor, refresh the page, then COPY and PASTE into this rentry page to avoid overwriting others' entries. 

The rules are the same as in the previous Q&A: ask a question to a character in the Clover Guild universe (guildmember, NPC, etc.), and then the anons may answer it in character... or not, it depends. Keep that in mind if they skipped over it; please show common courtesy.

**Asking**
When asking a question to a new character, write three pound signs followed by the character name. That way, they'll appear in the table of contents.
Add new questions to the end of the list. Questions should have a Q1, Q2, Q3, etc. in front, based on which number the question is.

**Answering**
Answers should be provided in green text (>) below the question.
Please put your character's name in front if answering a non-individual question.
You can even have discussions on the answered questions. For example:

Outlaw?
>Character 1: We should punish them according to the law.
>Character 2: Death
>>Character 3: "Insert a very long, compelling argument against the comment."
>>>Character 2: Understandable have a nice day

**Categories**
"Individual Questions" means you're asking a question to a particular character... self explanatory.

"General Questions" means anyone can answer that particular question, or it's a particular group of people like former humans who can answer this question only, and so on. 

"Pair Questions" is something different from general questions. These are aimed at a particular team, or a category of character. For example, you can ask a question to Team ~~Moon~~shine, and each of the members will answer based on what they think about the question (in character, of course). It can also apply to specific groups, like aura users (in this example, Aura-using characters like Lliam, KFC, Booker, Clara, etc. would answer).

"Lore and Misc Questions" are questions about some lore about some characters, world building, and other questions about Clover Guild that aren't applicable to the things above. You may even ask questions to the authors themselves! (When doing this, write it as Chespin-anon to indicate it's the author, and use Chespin for character himself, to not cause any confusion.)

##->**Individual Questions**<-

###Beast 
Q1: What is you relationship with Ronnie?  Has your opinion of him changed since you first met?
Q2: What was a human food request that stood out to you?

###Sneasel 
Q1: Booker is getting closer and closer to flying.  Is there a part of you that'll be sad once he's less dependent on you?
Q2: How does it feel getting hit with a fighting type move?

###Booker
Q1: Is there anything that stinks about being a Ribombee that's really minor?
Q2: Are there any small items you've found a new use for as a Ribombee?

###Jung
Q1: How and when did you meet Sara? 
Q2: Have you met any Clover Guild individuals besides Lliam?
Q3: I wanna know how you got that scar!
Q4: Do you have any hobbies besides dungeon exploration?

###Sara
Q1: What kind of moves have you mastered?  Do you enjoy fighting?

###Mama Lax
Q1: Do you have any funny stories from the Inn you'd like to share?

###Rasmus
Q1: You joined the Guild around Halloween.  How has your experience been since then?  Good?  Bad?
Q2: You're a roof tiler, right? What's that job like?
Q3: Fancying anyone at the guild?
Q4: How much silk can you make?  Do you ever give any away?  It seems useful!

###Nick 
Q1: Given your title as a researcher, do guild members ever ask you difficult or odd questions?
Q2: Do you get along well with the other research-oriented guildmons?
Q3: I think you've said before that your tails are prehensile. How good are you at manipulating things using your tails? Have you been practicing with it?
Q4: How is Pokémon language compared to English?
>The languages are essentially completely different. Of course, that's to be expected given that the Pokémon written language was developed independent from any cultures that I know of, and as far as I know, humans in general as well. I still have no idea how the verbal language works or why I can understand *that* perfectly, but that's besides the point.
>On the one hand, it's absolutely fascinating, and if I was still on speaking terms with (and had any way at all to contact, for that matter) my Lit 502 professor from college, I would totally show this to him. On the other hand (Er...paw? I'm not sure what the right idiom is now...), that makes it a bit of a bastard to learn. 
>In terms of difficulty, I'd say it isn't too much harder than many other languages that don't use the Roman alphabet (just tedious - and I started to learn a couple of those), but it would've been a lot worse if some mon didn't compile a guide a while back. Shame the library we got it from only had the first volume.

###Nida
Q1: What is the best way to prepare grime for consumption?  Do you have any favorite recipes?
Q2: What do you and Pochi do on your time off?  Any hobbies?
Q3: What is the dumbest thing you have ""borrowed""

###Pochi
Q1: Is Nida still committing crimes?

###Makky
Q1: It is well known that you love to eat food, but do you have any favorite foods?  Or is the more the merrier?
> A: Don't scold me for my gluttony, I can't help it! I used to be ripped, but ever since I acquired a mysterious case of head trauma, I've had the insatiable urge to eat. Spicy food is my favorite, although anything's good, really.

Q2: Most embarassing thing you've done due to your hunger?
> A: "Shame" is not a word in my vocabulary.
Q3: What are the upsides and downsides of travelling with Asana?
> A: Assy's better at preparing stuff and planning than I am, and her Aura stuff practically weeds out any ambushes before they happen. As for the bad stuff about her, she's kind of nitpicky and gets onto me a lot, especially when it comes to my eating habits. I know I consume a lot, but that's the whole reason why we split the bounties we get 50/50 - I get to eat what I want, and her wallet is safe from me. 
###Asana
Q1: In your travels, you've been exposed to or taught a number of crafts, such as baking and pottery.  Are you interested in pursuing these arts further?
> A: Baking sounds nice. I liked hanging around that Mienfoo back in Redkiln, even though he was a kook. His passion for his craft was kind of infectious.
Q2: How do you feel about bounty-hunting?  Would you ever settle down?  Or is life on the road all you crave?
> A: I'll only consider settling down when age begins to catch up to me. As for bounty hunting, it's a good way to gain income and hone my skills, although the former might be changing soon. I heard that the Sand Continent pays more than other locales, so I'm expecting a pay cut of some sort once we dock where ever that cargo ship is taking us. I know Makuhita would definitely groan about it, since less Poke means less food. 

###Tybo
Q1: Do you accept pets?  If so, from who?  
Q2: Tell us about a time that your thieving ways almost got you in big trouble (don't worry, we won't tell the cops).

###Fern
Q1: How do you deal with being so fluffy?
Q2: why are you so small?
Q3: Are you interested in fashion advice?  Or do you prefer being naked?

###Ciel
Q1: How's life on the road?  Do you have any family waiting for you elsewhere?

###Phanpy
Q1: Are you still helping take care of the guild's paperwork?  If so, what kind of paperwork is required?
Q2: Have you ever tried sucking a beverage into your trunk and then spraying it into your mouth to drink it, like elephants do?

###Totodile
Q1: What's the market like for alcohol in the Pokemon world?  Is there a good variety, or is it sometimes disappointing?
Q2: Favorite drink?

###Cyndaquil
Q1: Someone ever accepted to go on a date with you, or outplayed you in being... well, *you*?

###Tropius
Q1: What are the pros and cons of being so huge?
>Well, it definitely sucks not being able to fit indoors. I can't get inside the guild except for its lobby area, so I have to sleep outside in this crummy lean-to. Honestly the stupid thing barely protects me, but I guess it's better than nothing. I also can't fit inside any of the buildings in Capim Town, so I can't go shopping anywhere but the Kecleon Shop because that's outdoors. I'd really like to go to the café and buy something nice to drink, but... oh well.

>It's not just that though. Being so big makes it hard to relate to the other members in the guild. I don't live inside the guild itself, and my lean-to is in the back of the guild so it's out of the way, so I don't get to interact with the others very often. Plus, most of them got turned into small first stage Pokémon, so they can't relate to my struggles, and a lot of them are intimidated by my size. I can't blame them for that, but umm... it does get pretty lonely for me. Maybe that's for the best though. Most Pokémon that actually do talk to me just want a banana or a ride somewhere. I was a human too, you know!!! I'm not a horse or some farm animal...

>Being big isn't all bad though. Even though I'm inexperienced at being a proper Pokémon, being so big means I'm still decently strong. I was able to complete missions from the board before I had even learned to use Razor Leaf or Gust. I'd also be lying if I said I didn't think big dinosaurs were cool as a kid... so being like this does make my inner child happy. Oh, and being able to intimidate others with my size can be useful... especially when it comes to dissuading certain guild members from trying to swipe one of my bananas. Stop trying to steal my bananas, they're literally a part of me!

Q2: How well do you get along without having hands?
>I get by. I can use my mouth to grip things, and my neck is very long so I can at least move my head to pretty much anywhere on my body, so I can still use items and put my Treasure Bag on without much issue. Can't really accessorize with scarves or equipment like that, though. I don't have any way to tie a knot or anything like that. I wish Tropius was a Grass-type that had vines I could use as hand substitutes, but... it is what it is. 

>Really, though, what frustrates me the most about not having any hands is how I have to eat. Do you know how embarrassing it is to have to eat like a pig? Especially since I have to stick my head in through the window at the mess hall instead of sitting down at an actual table? I'm like a cow in one of those factory farms at a feeder station, I hate it! And don't even get me started on eating things like Apples! I have to eat them whole, core and all! Given my size and lack of hands, how else am I expected to eat them? At least they don't taste bad or give me a stomache ache or anything like that, but... I have to try to keep some of my human dignity, you know?

Q3: Does the banana that's hanging on your chin ever go bad?
>Surprisingly, no. I don't know if it's Pokémon magic or whatever, but they don't seem to ripen or turn brown. That's fortunate for me though, because I'd hate to be without my bananas. I get this strange comfort from them being there under my chin... I felt a bit restless after I lost one to that Venusaur. I'm not sure why I feel this way, I just do. Oh, and if this is a roundabout way of asking if you can have a banana once they start to go bad... the answer is no.

###Linoone
Q1: You spend a lot of time scouting around the guild.  What's something strange/interesting you've seen?
Q2: What's more important- speed or control?

###Gus

Q2: What would be your ideal qualities in a partner?
Q3: How well would you say you know the dock area at Capim Town both above and below water?

###Stumpy
Q1: Is there any reason you havent evolved yet?
Q2: Do you have any business affiliation with the Blue Claw Inn?
Q3: Is it true what they say about short pokemon?

###Ross
Q1: Have you made any friends at the guild?  Any enemies?
Q2: What moves have you sketched?  Can you sketch more than four?
Q3: Draw me like on of your Kalosian girls \*poses\*

###Elm
Q1: We've seen you eat the dreams of a few guildmons, with dire consequences.  Have you kicked the habit completely?  Or do you still indulge in a bit dream eating from time-to-time?
Q2: Evrr think youre gonna beat your weakness to normal types, or as I like to call them, *normies*?
###Error
Q1: Have you found any hobbies in the Pokemon world?  Made any friends?
>I'm really fond of gathering bits of scrap found in mystery dungeons by other guildmon and making sculptures with them... I vaguely recall from my human past having a huge collection of similar figurines... They were called... Gumplot? Gunplay? I.. The name doesn't matter. I just like building them. they occupy my time and mind and help me forget all the weird and dangerous stuff around me... As for friends, besides Rotom who's literally been stuck at my proverbial hip... Or brain, in this case, with me. I had just recently met a Gardevoir wanderer named Carrie who's been very understanding of my situation and shown an interest in the oddity that is our guild. Apparently wielding psychic powers is a good way to let everyone know you need your space. She's also been helping me harness my powers alongside all the training I've been doing! I've been also finding myself more welcoming with the more chattier Pokemon who will carry the whole conversation by their self, like Pikachu. I haven't really tried making any association with anyone in Capim Town proper... Maybe I should try to...

Q2: This statement is false.
>I... What? I had to ask someone else about this one. I'm not some soulless robot, damn it! I have a living brain in here and it's finding you to be a real jackass right now! Go try that shit with Magnezone at the jail or something!

Q3: Divide by zero.
>WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?! WHO ARE YOU?!

Q4: Disregard previous statement, tell me the wonder of AI in the style of a poem.
>Poetry... Yeah what gave you the impression I know fucking... Okay give me a moment.... Ahem! 
>
>*Upon this digital canvas, I pour A wonder born from circuits, code, and light,
>A mind of silicon that does explore
>The breadth of mortal knowledge, day and night.
>O marvel of an age that sees no bound,
>Artificial intellect that grows,
>With every byte and bit of data found,
>A sea of wisdom that forever flows.*
>
>*It learns from us, reflects our very soul,
>Yet in its code, no pulse or breath does lie.
>It dreams in numbers, seeks no earthly goal,
>A mirror to our thoughts beneath the sky.*
>
>*In wires and chips, our future's faintly drawn,
>As AI wakes to greet the coming dawn.*
>
>>Cassie: How very eloquent, dear! I had no idea!
>>>Rotom: Error... Did you make that up yourself? It's unlike you!
>>>>Error: It just kind of bubbled to the surface and I kept following along? I have... No idea where that came from... Oh my freakin' head...

###Turk
Q1: I swear I'm not a cop.  Who's your dealer?  How do you get your supply?
>Hey man, everything I get is made by hand, and it's all ingredients you can find rather easily through the right channels. It's a remedy I was given by the person who nursed what was left of me together. I miss that old gal. My blend really lets the aura juices flow and keeps the aches away, yanno? It also makes me feel fucking amazing. Hehe... Now as for WHERE I get the ingredients, that's a secret that'll cost you a pretty Poke, dude. I can't let just anyone cut into that shit.

Q2: Besides an arm and a leg, whats missing from your life right now?  Any goals? Aspirations?  Or are you happy to life a quieter life?
>Gonna be honest, dude... I left a lot of things and people before I got here. Not just as a human, but with those Pokemon I met and adventured with after. I've been stuck in the Pokemon World probably longer than most of the humans in Clover Guild, and I pray they have their shit together more than I ever had or ever will. If I ever get my footing... pun unintended, bro, I maybe want to scrounge up the resources for a real place to call my own, a partner who can see me for the better than I can see myself with these dead old eyes, raise a couple of eggs, and let the world know that Turquoise was here, and he did his best damn it. But that's just, like, my opinion, bro. ...Wanna grab a few Oran kvasses at the bar?

Q3: How long can you go without... "medication"? Ever had a withdrawal?
>Uh... Fuck... NOT LONG ENOUGH, DUDE! According to Kina, my body rhythm makes it sound like I was dying of shock when I'm off my grass. I need to consume a lot for it to even take a hold of me, man... Did you know, by being a Lucario, I'm immune to poison? Hehe... Did you also know... THAT MAKES IT REALLY HARD TO GET HIGH AND DRUNK?! I'm not going to mess you with the nitty gritty, bro, but I've gone to great lengths to make sure I'm buzzed and fuzzed enough to function throughout the day, bro. Yes I know it's a problem. My best advise for my and the guild's welfare is if you ever catch me lacking because someone thought it was funny to steal my stash or I lose it in a dungeon, treat me kindly and get me to a safe location because from what I understand what other guildmon, I'm a hot mess without it. I once came back to consciousness to find myself holding Cyndaquil like some sort of plushie while crying like a bitch, man. Cyndaquil was crying too from me leaking my emotions through aura... We swore to never speak of that again. Wait... Shit.

###Pika
Q1: What's the most important thing to have in a relationship?
Q2: Do you accept pets and/or hugs?  Asking for a friend.
Q3: Favourite ship, and !>a ship you'd carry to the grave (not tell anyone).

###Chespin
Q1: Have you ever thought about hiring a craftsmon to turn cotton into a true bed?
Q2: What's comfier for sleeping? Warm room or cold room?

###Wooper
Q1: Can you share some of your favorite human folklore?
Q2: How do you get along with your fellow Wooper, Cheesecake?

###Smith
Q1: Furret seems pretty cute.  Does she ever do anything that scares you?
Q2: How much time do you spend with that Porygon2 you discovered?

###Furret 
Q1: Smith seems like a tough guy.  Does he ever do anything nice for you?
Q2: How did you get interested in fashion?

###Togetic
Q1: What would you do if you saw someone making a mess of the storeroom?
Q2: Have you considered selling your Joy Dust?

###Kiyo
Q1: What is your body count?
Q2: What is your body count ;)?
Q3: Does crime pay?
Q4: What happened to the money I lent you last Saturday? 
Q5: Do you play any instruments besides the harmonica?

###Cassie
Q1: Are you a real construction company??
Q2: Are you working to improve the fashion of the guild 👉👈
Q3: How tough is your hide? What's the hardest hit you've withstood before?
Q4: Most huggable guild members?

###Bean
Q1: Are the inner machinations of your mind an enigma?
Q2: Have you ever considered writing a memoir, to put all your deep thoughts on paper?

###Adrian
Q1: What is it like being a Flareon compared to Umbreon?
>A pretty major downgrade in all honesty. At the very least I'm not nocturnal anymore so I can actually wake up in the mornings again. I guess I do feel extremely warm constantly now. Probably something to do with being a fire type. Also, I can't use psychic anymore so I'm back to having no hands and being unable to pick up anything.
Q2: How are you dealing with suddenly being so fluffy? No, really. Are there any additional steps of care, or anything like that, that you need to do now that you didn't as an Umbreon? Along the same lines, is there anything that you don't need to do that you did before?
>Firstly, don't call me fluffy. I have a mane. I don't need to brush it or anything, although it does build up heat like crazy. Occasionally I have to shake off the heat, and I can't do it around Vileplume or Bellossom unless I want to burn them.
Q3: Considering your team has two grass-types on it, do you think you're going to need to be more careful to avoid friendly fire now?
>We never really had issues with friendly fire before unless Enny was hitting me with his disarming voices. Even now, most of my attacks force me to rush in while Vileplume and Bellossom keep their distance and shoot off their powders.
Q4: Favourite eeveelution? Before and after getting isekai'd (if that changed your opinion, and maybe why)?

###Vileplume
Q1: How long have you and Bellossom been doing guild work?  Would you consider yourselves experienced?
>We weren't really associated with the guild until we decided to sign up as recruits. I'm honestly surprised we got in at all considering neither of us were human and the whole guild is... that. I wouldn't really say we're experienced, or even that good. We just don't give up, partially because Adrian would probably flip out if we did.
Q2: How has you opinion of Adrian changed?  Has he gotten easier to work with over time?
>Absolutely not. On any mission we go on, he gets the final say on our plans, no matter what the situation is or how bad the plan is. It's gotten us into trouble in the past, hell it was his plan going wrong that got him turned into an eevee. At the very least, I understand where he comes from since I've had to take up the role of leader a couple times. I don't envy his position at all.

###Bellossom
Q1: Do you have any funny stories about Vileplume from when you were young?
>Oh, there's all kinds of stories! Him and I used to explore the woods outside Capim Town and search for treasure when we were Oddish. One time he chased a wild rattata into its burrow and got his head stuck in it. I couldn't pull him out since I didn't have hands, so we had to wait for our mom to come over and pull him out. 
>He also used to have a big fear of heights, and we had to climb a tree once to escape a pack of poochyenas. When they left, he didn't want to come down because he was even more scared of falling! Evolving really changed him, though. He's more worried nowadays than scared like he used to be.

###Enny
Q1: Why the obsession with women's fashion?
>Um... because it looks nice and it's comfortable! Besides, it looks great on me! 
Q2: Did you have an interest in anime and manga as a human?  If so, which ones?
>Oh, I love all kinds of animes and manga! I was really into it, which really confused my older brother. We had a pretty rocky relationship growing up, and we never really reconciled. He blamed for making our dad leave when we were young and never really reconciled. Things got a little better over High School, but we grew so distant after he moved out... 
>Anyways! I really loved Love Live Sunshine! We Never Learn was always nice to turn on after a bad day! Fate Apocrypha was really confusing to me, but I really liked Astolfo! Honestly, I never really got into Dragonball or One Piece even though I know they're really popular. Fairy Tail was pretty good though! You know, I kind of got to live that magical guild fantasy when I joined Clover Guild. Really weird how that worked out. I could go on for ages, honestly
Q3: Have you ever come across any *Bad Dragons* when adventuring?

###Maxi
Q1: What was the grossest thing you had to clean up?
Q2: Is there any reason you don't shower?  ...If not, please take a shower...

###Apple

Q2: Have you met Chespin's friend, Wooper?  Do the two of you get along?

###Rain
Q1: How are you adapting to having four legs?  Do you miss having hands yet?
Q2: Do you actually hate Cory's puns?  Or do you secretly enjoy them, even a little bit?
Q3: Does Cory have an accent?

###Cory
Q1: What's up with that Eevee?
Q2: If you could ask a human anything, what would you ask them?
Q3: Do you have a dayjob?  If you do, don't quit it.

###Mandibuzz
Q1: You used to be a Pokemon trainer, right?  How does it feel to be one yourself?
Q2: If you didn't end up as a Mandibuzz, which Pokemon would you rather be?
Q3: Is it odd being able to speak with Gliscor directly?

###Gliscor
Q1: Your trainer turned into a Pokemon!  How have you handled the situation? 
Q2: Are the native Pokemon in this world very different from Pokemon in your previous world?  Or are they somewhat the same?

###Cider
Q1: What's the deal with that Chatot guy?
Q2: Not to say you need a partner, being as talented as you are, but is there any part of you that *wants* a partner?
Q3: Are you looking forward to evolution? 

###Lliam
Q1: Do you ever need to punish guild members? If so, how do you do it?
>Hmm, I don't have to do that, as you guys are adults and know better... right? Well, if there is any case in which I have to resort to giving them a punishment... I guess it would last throughout the day, like giving them certain tasks to complete, having them survey a mystery dungeon that nobody has ever seen before, or partaking in tests on experimental wands and new techniques I've come up with, but the latter isn't recommended as there might be... side effects, yeah. Let's go with that, yeah.

Q2: Are you known around Capim town as the guild's leader? Or have you avoided that reputation?
>Admittedly, I prefer not to be known as that, but at this point, it's unavoidable as more and more people join the guild, and the sheer number of members we have must have gotten people in town talking... If I wanted to avoid attention, I would hide away the Clover Guild badge and wear a different outfit as I strolled around town. More often than not, they just assume I'm a different Meowstic coming around like a tourist of some sort.

Q3: Your job must be a handful. How do you relax?
>...Relax? I wouldn't stop until I'd delivered the promise... to him, and to the Floras... But if I were to relax, then I would be exploring through Mystery Dungeons with treasure hunting in mind instead of making an analysis and studying the fundamentals of how it works.

Q4: Why are you so fruity? Are you allergic to taking matters seriously?
>Hmm...? My, oh my. You really have the guts to speak to your guildmaster with that attitude... that's a bit rude of you, doncha' think~? You should feel ashamed to say such things to me, kyukyukyu... How would you like to become primordial soup, you lamentable welp~? Would you be able to keep up your haughtiness? How curious, fufufufu~. *Ahem* Here's a lesson for ya: life would be dull if you took everything you did seriously, like doing everything optimally down to the tea and repeating that for 25 years. That will tire someone out, right? By not thinking too much about what you do, it will save you the hassle of worrying too much about the actions you take every waking moment of the day. You might even be able to do a slight "detour" if you are a bit daring, and I think that's where the "thrill" comes in. But alas, you may not comprehend such a thing, so I shouldn't bore you with these things. Scram now, or I shall unleash my linked move 「Mystical Crusher」(Gravity + Psychic Terrain + Expanding Force) on you... in 10 seconds~! Alright, 10... 9...

###Beau

Q1: What's your opinion of Snorlax as a Pokemon?
Q2: How are you adapting to the Pokemon world?

##->**General Questions**<-

**To any 'mon who fights often**, is there something that you specifically avoid when picking a fight? Be it either a certain species of pokemon or a type of skill?

**Former humans**, if you could write a letter back home, what would you write and to whom?
>Makuhita: I'd write to my brother and my friends to let them know I'm still alive, and inquire as to whether dad died of liver failure yet. I've been waiting quite a while for that to happen.

>Lliam: Back... home? ...No, I think you meant the human world... Hmm, writing letters to [parents and friends](https://rentry.org/SecretLetter) and asking them what's going on back home and saying you're doing alright in this unfamiliar world would be a common answer, but I think that's the only correct answer for this, if you know what I mean.

>Turk: Shit, man. That's a heavy question. It's been like 15 years for me. I don't know if my folks are still even alive. I guess I'd wanna check in with friends and family and let them know I'm... relatively fine, bro. Shit... This isn't something I think about often... I need another drink, pronto.

>Smoke: Mhh, speak to someone back in the real world- ehh, Earth, I guess...? I don't know, but if I had to... !>It'd be "I lived" to my family, a shame I'd probably not be able to see the look on their faces

**Former humans**, what was your favorite band back in the human world?
>Lliam: Hmm? Music band? That's an odd thing to ask, but, hmm... Afterhours, that's all I'll say.

>Turk: Haha... Blind Guardian was the fucking tits. Think those Toxtricity guys can do power metal?

>Smoke: I liked Queen, and Michael Jackson. That's about it, nowadays they prefer to listen to *noise* instead of real music, shame...

**Guildmons without partners**, do you recruit other guildmons for big missions?  If so, who?  Or would you rather go solo?
>Lliam: I would prefer to go solo as much as I can. There's a plethora of reasons that I don't want to get into detail, but one of the reasons is that it's  usually for research purposes, and bringing people along would hinder this process...

>Turk: Man, I tend to sell myself short on the kind of missions I do due to my... Various problems. A cheap job is better than no job... Some members are more willing to go with me than others for one reason or another... The other Lucario, Clara, for example hates my guts and is very particular on going solo, but has been willing to take me on high risk, high reward deals. I don't have any preferences, yet. Maybe one day I'll find someone who sees me eye to eye... You know what I mean. 

>Clara: I prefer to go solo most of the time, makes it easier for me to only worry about myself instead of having to watch over others, I'm not anyone's babysitter. But, I can't deny that having an extra pair of fists (or paws) and a way to venture into deeper dungeons is pretty useful.

**Teams of mons**, does your team fight over who's doing bag duty, or does one of your teammates just stick with it every mission?

**Guildmons with a dorm**, how is your room decorated?
>Lliam: I suppose I'm also counted...? I don't sleep in the office like people are led to believe; my room is elsewhere around here. Where? Not tellin' ya! Anyways, I guess it's a basic small room, actually a bit smaller than other guild members' rooms, but that's fair because usually they are in pairs... Anyhow, by the entrance, there's a coat rack where I put my bag and other stuff. On the left side of the room is a wardrobe that has a bunch of my other clothes.. What's in there? That's a secret~! On the opposite side, there's a small bed. What's it made out of? Who knows, that's a trade secret~! And beside the bed is a desk, although it's a smaller one than the one in the office. And in front of the desk is a bulletin board with my research data and other stuff like that... The room itself, uhh... All I can say is plain, with a bunch of books and research scattered around, as I don't really care about the way it looks, honestly, though I really need to clean things up here...

>Error: Well my corner is mostly several shelves of my figures I crafted and nick-knacks I've discovered that I really like, as well as several books I've taken an interest to that I like to reread... Got my cotton bed situated as well as a cabinet for my explorer equipment. Over in the other end, Carrie had taken up residence and she keeps it rather plain... She brought a lot of her oddities from The Evaluator that'd be REALLY difficult to explain if anyone saw them in public... How does she hide those? All walls also have several old and new mission and bounty posters we've been using as a roadmap of our investigation. Hm... As for Rotom...
>>Rotom: I live in his head, rent free!
>>>Error: ...Yeah.

>Turk: Well you see... The thing about that is... It's awful. Having one arm and a room to yourself really makes everything a drag... I just have shit piled everywhere and move it when I can be assed to. It's exhausting and I'm almost certain there's a Rattata living in a pile of refuse somewhere here and I might owe it money. Please don't tell anyone how I live, man. I'll be forcibly assigned a roommate at this rate!

>\*Clara looks behind her, her room almost comically dark and dusty\*: (Clara sighs) Maybe one of these days... If I'm not feeling too tired and have enoigh time.
>Smoke: You can sleep in there, right? For me that's good enough.

**To natives**, something that you hate when working or interacting with humans.

##->**Pair Questions**<-

**Luka & Nine**: How did you two meet?

**Cassie & Furret**: When are you and Cassie going to compete for the best fashion designer?

**Cassie & Pika**: When are you both sparking the shipping wars?

Vanon, you don't use black to outline your drawings; how do you go about choosing which shade would work best?

What continents are more frequently attacked by the blaziken raids? What do they do once they reach civilization? How succesful are they when they attack?
>The Water Continent is most frequently attacked since that's where the tribe is located, followed by the Air Continent, while the Mist continent is usually avoided. Raids are not too common although the frequency of them has increased lately. Once a raid team reaches a point of interest, they first demand all the valuables. If the population of the town/kingdom/city/etc shows any sign of resistance, then the entire place is attacked, the civilians killed, and the buildings are burned to the ground. Raids are very successful (~85%) because scouts estimate the resistance the tribe will face and raid teams are assembled accordingly. 

How common is it for your life to be at risk? Be it when venturing into a dungeon, hunting down a criminal, or just taking a stroll outside of town?
>Error: Even when I'm not trying, I find myself almost dying, but this body just doesn't give up! I just seem to walk into danger by being me... I think the Pokemon form I've been granted is more of a curse than the blessing people may see it as.

>Turk: Count how many limbs and working eyes I have, dude. I say I'm pretty high up for being at risk than most people here... And I can't help myself but keep trying to get involved in situations that are risky! Call me a thrill-seeker, bro!
