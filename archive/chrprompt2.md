#**Second Clover Guild Character Q&A** (Uh, actually, this is technically the 3rd one, and the Aggie editions don't count, but whatever!!)

!!!Warning: Please write all entries into a text editor, refresh the page, then COPY and PASTE into this rentry page to avoid overwriting others' entries. 

The rules are the same as in the previous Q&A: ask a question to a character in the Clover Guild (or any of the NPCs, outsiders, etc. in that world), and then the question might be answered in character... or not, it depends. Keep that in mind if they skipped over it; please show common courtesy.

Answers should be provided in green text (>) below the question. Please preappend your character's name if answering a non-individual question. You can even have discussions on the answered questions. Below are examples:

Outlaw?
>Character 1: We should punish them according to the law.
>Character 2: Death
>>Character 3: "Insert a very long, compelling argument against the comment."
>>>Character 2: Understandable have a nice day

**Character name** (When asking a character a question, do something like this and write the new question on the bottom of the last asked question.)

-Question 1
-Question 2 
-Question 3

(Think of this as questions like ooo Elm, you're afraid of ghost oooo, gets heart attack and whatever. If you still don't get it, you can use the written questions below as references for yours on how it is done... or something.)

"Individual Questions" means you're asking a question to a particular character... self explanatory.

"General Questions" means anyone can answer that particular question, or it's a particular group of people like former humans who can answer this question only, and so on. 

"Pair Questions" is something different from general questions, like it's a particular team, like you're asking a question for Team ~~Moon~~shine for example, and each of the members will answer based on what they think about the question, in character, of course. It can also be specific, like aura users, so like Lliam, KFC, Booker, and several others can answer this question (I forgor the rest, sorreh!!)

"Lore and Misc Questions" are questions about some lore about some characters, world building, and other questions about Clover Guild that aren't applicable to the things above. You may even ask questions to the authors themselves! (Write it as Chespin-anon for author and Chespin for character to not cause any confusion.)
