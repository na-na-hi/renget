#Second (Official) Clover Guild Character Q&A

!!!Warning: Please write all entries into a text editor, refresh the page, then COPY and PASTE into this rentry page to avoid overwriting others' entries. 

The rules are the same as in the previous Q&A: ask a question to a character in the Clover Guild universe (guildmember, NPC, etc.), and then the anons may answer it in character... or not, it depends. Keep that in mind if they skipped over it; please show common courtesy.

**Asking**
When asking a question to a new character, write three pound signs followed by the character name. That way, they'll appear in the table of contents.
Add new questions to the end of the list. Questions should have a Q1, Q2, Q3, etc. in front, based on which number the question is.

**Answering**
Answers should be provided in green text (>) below the question.
Please put your character's name in front if answering a non-individual question.
You can even have discussions on the answered questions. For example:

Outlaw?
>Character 1: We should punish them according to the law.
>Character 2: Death
>>Character 3: "Insert a very long, compelling argument against the comment."
>>>Character 2: Understandable have a nice day

**Categories**
"Individual Questions" means you're asking a question to a particular character... self explanatory.

"General Questions" means anyone can answer that particular question, or it's a particular group of people like former humans who can answer this question only, and so on. 

"Pair Questions" is something different from general questions. These are aimed at a particular team, or a category of character. For example, you can ask a question to Team ~~Moon~~shine, and each of the members will answer based on what they think about the question (in character, of course). It can also apply to specific groups, like aura users (in this example, Aura-using characters like Lliam, KFC, Booker, Clara, etc. would answer).

"Lore and Misc Questions" are questions about some lore about some characters, world building, and other questions about Clover Guild that aren't applicable to the things above. You may even ask questions to the authors themselves! (When doing this, write it as Chespin-anon to indicate it's the author, and use Chespin for character himself, to not cause any confusion.)

Q2: How does it feel getting hit with a fighting type move?

Q2: Have you met any Clover Guild individuals besides Lliam?
Q3: I wanna know how you got that scar!
Q4: Do you have any hobbies besides dungeon exploration?

###Sara
Q1: What kind of moves have you mastered?  Do you enjoy fighting?

###Mama Lax
Q1: Do you have any funny stories from the Inn you'd like to share?

###Rasmus
Q1: You joined the Guild around Halloween.  How has your experience been since then?  Good?  Bad?
Q2: You're a roof tiler, right? What's that job like?
Q3: Fancying anyone at the guild?
Q4: How much silk can you make?  Do you ever give any away?  It seems useful!

###Nick 
Q1: Given your title as a researcher, do guild members ever ask you difficult or odd questions?
Q2: Do you get along well with the other research-oriented guildmons?
Q3: I think you've said before that your tails are prehensile. How good are you at manipulating things using your tails? Have you been practicing with it?
Q4: How is Pokémon language compared to English?
>The languages are essentially completely different. Of course, that's to be expected given that the Pokémon written language was developed independent from any cultures that I know of, and as far as I know, humans in general as well. I still have no idea how the verbal language works or why I can understand *that* perfectly, but that's besides the point.
>On the one hand, it's absolutely fascinating, and if I was still on speaking terms with (and had any way at all to contact, for that matter) my Lit 502 professor from college, I would totally show this to him. On the other hand (Er...paw? I'm not sure what the right idiom is now...), that makes it a bit of a bastard to learn. 
>In terms of difficulty, I'd say it isn't too much harder than many other languages that don't use the Roman alphabet (just tedious - and I started to learn a couple of those), but it would've been a lot worse if some mon didn't compile a guide a while back. Shame the library we got it from only had the first volume.

###Nida
Q1: What is the best way to prepare grime for consumption?  Do you have any favorite recipes?
Q2: What do you and Pochi do on your time off?  Any hobbies?
Q3: What is the dumbest thing you have ""borrowed""

###Pochi
Q1: Is Nida still committing crimes?

###Makky
Q1: It is well known that you love to eat food, but do you have any favorite foods?  Or is the more the merrier?
> A: Don't scold me for my gluttony, I can't help it! I used to be ripped, but ever since I acquired a mysterious case of head trauma, I've had the insatiable urge to eat. Spicy food is my favorite, although anything's good, really.

Q2: Most embarassing thing you've done due to your hunger?
> A: "Shame" is not a word in my vocabulary.
Q3: What are the upsides and downsides of travelling with Asana?
> A: Assy's better at preparing stuff and planning than I am, and her Aura stuff practically weeds out any ambushes before they happen. As for the bad stuff about her, she's kind of nitpicky and gets onto me a lot, especially when it comes to my eating habits. I know I consume a lot, but that's the whole reason why we split the bounties we get 50/50 - I get to eat what I want, and her wallet is safe from me. 
###Asana
Q1: In your travels, you've been exposed to or taught a number of crafts, such as baking and pottery.  Are you interested in pursuing these arts further?
> A: Baking sounds nice. I liked hanging around that Mienfoo back in Redkiln, even though he was a kook. His passion for his craft was kind of infectious.
Q2: How do you feel about bounty-hunting?  Would you ever settle down?  Or is life on the road all you crave?
> A: I'll only consider settling down when age begins to catch up to me. As for bounty hunting, it's a good way to gain income and hone my skills, although the former might be changing soon. I heard that the Sand Continent pays more than other locales, so I'm expecting a pay cut of some sort once we dock where ever that cargo ship is taking us. I know Makuhita would definitely groan about it, since less Poke means less food. 

###Tybo
Q1: Do you accept pets?  If so, from who?  
Q2: Tell us about a time that your thieving ways almost got you in big trouble (don't worry, we won't tell the cops).

###Fern
Q1: How do you deal with being so fluffy?
Q2: why are you so small?
Q3: Are you interested in fashion advice?  Or do you prefer being naked?

###Ciel
Q1: How's life on the road?  Do you have any family waiting for you elsewhere?

###Phanpy
Q1: Are you still helping take care of the guild's paperwork?  If so, what kind of paperwork is required?
Q2: Have you ever tried sucking a beverage into your trunk and then spraying it into your mouth to drink it, like elephants do?

###Totodile
Q1: What's the market like for alcohol in the Pokemon world?  Is there a good variety, or is it sometimes disappointing?
Q2: Favorite drink?

###Tropius
Q1: What are the pros and cons of being so huge?
>Well, it definitely sucks not being able to fit indoors. I can't get inside the guild except for its lobby area, so I have to sleep outside in this crummy lean-to. Honestly the stupid thing barely protects me, but I guess it's better than nothing. I also can't fit inside any of the buildings in Capim Town, so I can't go shopping anywhere but the Kecleon Shop because that's outdoors. I'd really like to go to the café and buy something nice to drink, but... oh well.

>It's not just that though. Being so big makes it hard to relate to the other members in the guild. I don't live inside the guild itself, and my lean-to is in the back of the guild so it's out of the way, so I don't get to interact with the others very often. Plus, most of them got turned into small first stage Pokémon, so they can't relate to my struggles, and a lot of them are intimidated by my size. I can't blame them for that, but umm... it does get pretty lonely for me. Maybe that's for the best though. Most Pokémon that actually do talk to me just want a banana or a ride somewhere. I was a human too, you know!!! I'm not a horse or some farm animal...

>Being big isn't all bad though. Even though I'm inexperienced at being a proper Pokémon, being so big means I'm still decently strong. I was able to complete missions from the board before I had even learned to use Razor Leaf or Gust. I'd also be lying if I said I didn't think big dinosaurs were cool as a kid... so being like this does make my inner child happy. Oh, and being able to intimidate others with my size can be useful... especially when it comes to dissuading certain guild members from trying to swipe one of my bananas. Stop trying to steal my bananas, they're literally a part of me!

Q2: How well do you get along without having hands?
>I get by. I can use my mouth to grip things, and my neck is very long so I can at least move my head to pretty much anywhere on my body, so I can still use items and put my Treasure Bag on without much issue. Can't really accessorize with scarves or equipment like that, though. I don't have any way to tie a knot or anything like that. I wish Tropius was a Grass-type that had vines I could use as hand substitutes, but... it is what it is. 

>Really, though, what frustrates me the most about not having any hands is how I have to eat. Do you know how embarrassing it is to have to eat like a pig? Especially since I have to stick my head in through the window at the mess hall instead of sitting down at an actual table? I'm like a cow in one of those factory farms at a feeder station, I hate it! And don't even get me started on eating things like Apples! I have to eat them whole, core and all! Given my size and lack of hands, how else am I expected to eat them? At least they don't taste bad or give me a stomache ache or anything like that, but... I have to try to keep some of my human dignity, you know?

Q3: Does the banana that's hanging on your chin ever go bad?
>Surprisingly, no. I don't know if it's Pokémon magic or whatever, but they don't seem to ripen or turn brown. That's fortunate for me though, because I'd hate to be without my bananas. I get this strange comfort from them being there under my chin... I felt a bit restless after I lost one to that Venusaur. I'm not sure why I feel this way, I just do. Oh, and if this is a roundabout way of asking if you can have a banana once they start to go bad... the answer is no.

###Linoone
Q1: You spend a lot of time scouting around the guild.  What's something strange/interesting you've seen?
Q2: What's more important- speed or control?

###Macom
Q1: What's it like going from being an XCOM soldier to being a cute fluffy little electric sheep :3 ?
Q2: If someone asked to hug or cuddle with you and your soft wool, would you accept?

###Gus
Q1: r u bald?
Q2: What would be your ideal qualities in a partner?
Q3: How well would you say you know the dock area at Capim Town both above and below water?

###Stumpy
Q1: Is there any reason you havent evolved yet?
Q2: Do you have any business affiliation with the Blue Claw Inn?

###Ross
Q1: Have you made any friends at the guild?  Any enemies?
Q2: What moves have you sketched?  Can you sketch more than four?

###Elm
Q1: We've seen you eat the dreams of a few guildmons, with dire consequences.  Have you kicked the habit completely?  Or do you still indulge in a bit dream eating from time-to-time?

###Error
Q1: Have you found any hobbies in the Pokemon world?  Made any friends?
>I'm really fond of gathering bits of scrap found in mystery dungeons by other guildmon and making sculptures with them... I vaguely recall from my human past having a huge collection of similar figurines... They were called... Gumplot? Gunplay? I.. The name doesn't matter. I just like building them. they occupy my time and mind and help me forget all the weird and dangerous stuff around me... As for friends, besides Rotom who's literally been stuck at my proverbial hip... Or brain, in this case, with me. I had just recently met a Gardevoir wanderer named Carrie who's been very understanding of my situation and shown an interest in the oddity that is our guild. Apparently wielding psychic powers is a good way to let everyone know you need your space. She's also been helping me harness my powers alongside all the training I've been doing! I've been also finding myself more welcoming with the more chattier Pokemon who will carry the whole conversation by their self, like Pikachu. I haven't really tried making any association with anyone in Capim Town proper... Maybe I should try to...
Q2: This statement is false.
>I... What? I had to ask someone else about this one. I'm not some soulless robot, damn it! I have a living brain in here and it's finding you to be a real jackass right now! Go try that shit with Magnezone at the jail or something!

###Turk
Q1: I swear I'm not a cop.  Who's your dealer?  How do you get your supply?
>Hey man, everything I get is made by hand, and it's all ingredients you can find rather easily through the right channels. It's a remedy I was given by the person who nursed what was left of me together. I miss that old gal. My blend really lets the aura juices flow and keeps the aches away, yanno? It also makes me feel fucking amazing. Hehe... Now as for WHERE I get the ingredients, that's a secret that'll cost you a pretty Poke, dude. I can't let just anyone cut into that shit.
Q2: Besides an arm and a leg, whats missing from your life right now?  Any goals?  Aspirations? Or are you happy to life a quieter life?
>Gonna be honest, dude... I left a lot of things and people before I got here. Not just as a human, but with those Pokemon I met and adventured with after. I've been stuck in the Pokemon World probably longer than most of the humans in Clover Guild, and I pray they have their shit together more than I ever had or ever will. If I ever get my footing... pun unintended, bro, I maybe want to scrounge up the resources for a real place to call my own, a partner who can see me for the better than I can see myself with these dead old eyes, raise a couple of eggs, and let the world know that Turquoise was here, and he did his best damn it. But that's just, like, my opinion, bro. Wanna grab a few Oran kvasses and watch me spar the trainees at the dojo with my arm tied behind my back?

###Pika
Q1: What's the most important thing to have in a relationship?
Q2: Do you accept pets and/or hugs?  Asking for a friend.

###Chespin
Q1: Have you ever thought about hiring a craftsmon to turn cotton into a true bed?
Q2: What's comfier for sleeping? Warm room or cold room?

###Wooper
Q1: Can you share some of your favorite human folklore?
Q2: How do you get along with your fellow Wooper, Cheesecake?

###Smith
Q1: Furret seems pretty cute.  Does she ever do anything that scares you?
Q2: How much time do you spend with that Porygon2 you discovered?

###Furret 
Q1: Smith seems like a tough guy.  Does he ever do anything nice for you?
Q2: How did you get interested in fashion?

###Togetic
Q1: What would you do if you saw someone making a mess of the storeroom?
Q2: Have you considered selling your Joy Dust?

###Kiyo
Q1: What is your body count?
Q2: What is your body count ;)?
Q3: Does crime pay?
Q4: What happened to the money I lent you last Saturday? 
Q5: Do you play any instruments besides the harmonica?

###Cassie
Q1: Are you a real construction company??
Q2: Are you working to improve the fashion of the guild 👉👈
Q3: How tough is your hide? What's the hardest hit you've withstood before?

###Bean
Q1: Are the inner machinations of your mind an enigma?
Q2: Have you ever considered writing a memoir, to put all your deep thoughts on paper?

###Adrian
Q1: What is it like being a Flareon compared to Umbreon?
>A pretty major downgrade in all honesty. At the very least I'm not nocturnal anymore so I can actually wake up in the mornings again. I guess I do feel extremely warm constantly now. Probably something to do with being a fire type. Also, I can't use psychic anymore so I'm back to having no hands and being unable to pick up anything.
Q2: How are you dealing with suddenly being so fluffy? No, really. Are there any additional steps of care, or anything like that, that you need to do now that you didn't as an Umbreon? Along the same lines, is there anything that you don't need to do that you did before?
>Firstly, don't call me fluffy. I have a mane. I don't need to brush it or anything, although it does build up heat like crazy. Occasionally I have to shake off the heat, and I can't do it around Vileplume or Bellossom unless I want to burn them.
Q3: Considering your team has two grass-types on it, do you think you're going to need to be more careful to avoid friendly fire now?
>We never really had issues with friendly fire before unless Enny was hitting me with his disarming voices. Even now, most of my attacks force me to rush in while Vileplume and Bellossom keep their distance and shoot off their powders.

###Vileplume
Q1: How long have you and Bellossom been doing guild work?  Would you consider yourselves experienced?
>We weren't really associated with the guild until we decided to sign up as recruits. I'm honestly surprised we got in at all considering neither of us were human and the whole guild is... that. I wouldn't really say we're experienced, or even that good. We just don't give up, partially because Adrian would probably flip out if we did.
Q2: How has you opinion of Adrian changed?  Has he gotten easier to work with over time?
>Absolutely not. On any mission we go on, he gets the final say on our plans, no matter what the situation is or how bad the plan is. It's gotten us into trouble in the past, hell it was his plan going wrong that got him turned into an eevee. At the very least, I understand where he comes from since I've had to take up the role of leader a couple times. I don't envy his position at all.

###Bellossom
Q1: Do you have any funny stories about Vileplume from when you were young?
>Oh, there's all kinds of stories! Him and I used to explore the woods outside Capim Town and search for treasure when we were Oddish. One time he chased a wild rattata into its burrow and got his head stuck in it. I couldn't pull him out since I didn't have hands, so we had to wait for our mom to come over and pull him out. 
>He also used to have a big fear of heights, and we had to climb a tree once to escape a pack of poochyenas. When they left, he didn't want to come down because he was even more scared of falling! Evolving really changed him, though. He's more worried nowadays than scared like he used to be.

###Enny
Q1: Why the obsession with women's fashion?
>Um... because it looks nice and it's comfortable! Besides, it looks great on me! 
Q2: Did you have an interest in anime and manga as a human?  If so, which ones?
>Oh, I love all kinds of animes and manga! I was really into it, which really confused my older brother. We had a pretty rocky relationship growing up, and we never really reconciled. He blamed for making our dad leave when we were young and never really reconciled. Things got a little better over High School, but we grew so distant after he moved out... 
>Anyways! I really loved Love Live Sunshine! We Never Learn was always nice to turn on after a bad day! Fate Apocrypha was really confusing to me, but I really liked Astolfo! Honestly, I never really got into Dragonball or One Piece even though I know they're really popular. Fairy Tail was pretty good though! You know, I kind of got to live that magical guild fantasy when I joined Clover Guild. Really weird how that worked out. I could go on for ages, honestly

Q2: Is there any reason you don't shower?  ...If not, please take a shower...

###Cory
Q1: What's up with that Eevee?
Q2: If you could ask a human anything, what would you ask them?
Q3: Do you have a dayjob?  If you do, don't quit it.

###Mandibuzz

Q2: If you didn't end up as a Mandibuzz, which Pokemon would you rather be?
Q3: Is it odd being able to speak with Gliscor directly?

###Gliscor

Q3: Are you looking forward to evolution? 

###Lliam
Q1: Do you ever need to punish guild members? If so, how do you do it?
>Hmm, I don't have to do that, as you guys are adults and know better... right? Well, if there is any case in which I have to resort to giving them a punishment... I guess it would last throughout the day, like giving them certain tasks to complete, having them survey a mystery dungeon that nobody has ever seen before, or partaking in tests on experimental wands and new techniques I've come up with, but the latter isn't recommended as there might be... side effects, yeah. Let's go with that, yeah.

Q2: Are you known around Capim town as the guild's leader? Or have you avoided that reputation?
>Admittedly, I prefer not to be known as that, but at this point, it's unavoidable as more and more people join the guild, and the sheer number of members we have must have gotten people in town talking... If I wanted to avoid attention, I would hide away the Clover Guild badge and wear a different outfit as I strolled around town. More often than not, they just assume I'm a different Meowstic coming around like a tourist of some sort.

Q3: Your job must be a handful. How do you relax?
>...Relax? I wouldn't stop until I'd delivered the promise... to him, and to the Floras... But if I were to relax, then I would be exploring through Mystery Dungeons with treasure hunting in mind instead of making an analysis and studying the fundamentals of how it works.
