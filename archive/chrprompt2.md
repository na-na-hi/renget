#Second (Official) Clover Guild Character Q&A

!!!Warning: Please write all entries into a text editor, refresh the page, then COPY and PASTE into this rentry page to avoid overwriting others' entries. 

The rules are the same as in the previous Q&A: ask a question to a character in the Clover Guild universe (guildmember, NPC, etc.), and then the anons may answer it in character... or not, it depends. Keep that in mind if they skipped over it; please show common courtesy.

**Asking**
When asking a question to a new character, write three pound signs followed by the character name. That way, they'll appear in the table of contents.
Add new questions to the end of the list. Questions should have a Q1, Q2, Q3, etc. in front, based on which number the question is.

**Answering**
Answers should be provided in green text (>) below the question.
Please put your character's name in front if answering a non-individual question.
You can even have discussions on the answered questions. For example:

Outlaw?
>Character 1: We should punish them according to the law.
>Character 2: Death
>>Character 3: "Insert a very long, compelling argument against the comment."
>>>Character 2: Understandable have a nice day

**Categories**
"Individual Questions" means you're asking a question to a particular character... self explanatory.

"General Questions" means anyone can answer that particular question, or it's a particular group of people like former humans who can answer this question only, and so on. 

"Pair Questions" is something different from general questions. These are aimed at a particular team, or a category of character. For example, you can ask a question to Team ~~Moon~~shine, and each of the members will answer based on what they think about the question (in character, of course). It can also apply to specific groups, like aura users (in this example, Aura-using characters like Lliam, KFC, Booker, Clara, etc. would answer).

"Lore and Misc Questions" are questions about some lore about some characters, world building, and other questions about Clover Guild that aren't applicable to the things above. You may even ask questions to the authors themselves! (When doing this, write it as Chespin-anon to indicate it's the author, and use Chespin for character himself, to not cause any confusion.)

##->**Individual Questions**<-

###Beast 
Q1: What is you relationship with Ronnie?  Has your opinion of him changed since you first met?
Q2: What was a human food request that stood out to you?

###Sneasel 
Q1: Booker is getting closer and closer to flying.  Is there a part of you that'll be sad once he's less dependent on you?
>W-what makes you ask that? Did Toge tell you about that awful Gardevoir mission we did? ...Huh? He didn’t? Oh. Uh, forget I said anything.
>Anyway, to answer that question: yeah, I have been kinda worried about that, not gonna lie. I mean, I’ve spent so much time carrying him, it’s gonna be weird when he can get around without my help. But I’ve been rooting for him ever since he started learning how to fly. I don’t want him to be weak and slow forever. I want him to get stronger! And being able to fly is part of that. Besides, it ain’t like he’s gonna go away and never come back once he’s able to fly. We’ll still stay together. So I’m not too sad about it—I’m looking forward to seeing his dream come true!

Q2: How does it feel getting hit with a fighting type move?
>Oh boy, it hurts like hell! Even if it’s a weak attack, it causes some major pain, cuz of that energy put into it. If you just punch one of us normally, we can probably take it, but if you turn it into a real move by pumping energy into it, it’ll feel like you got slammed hard by a flaming bag of rocks. Clawfolk and Fighting-type energy just don’t mix. But it ain’t my fault. Ask anyone with a double weakness and they’re gonna tell you the same thing. It’s just the way we’re built.
>Booker always freaks out whenever a Fighting-type attack comes at us. Even though he’s super resistant to that type of energy, he’s always worried for me. He still thinks I’ll die from even the littlest Fighting-type move. I hate seeing the little guy get scared like that, though, so I guess it’s good motivation to dodge as much as I can.

###Booker
Q1: Is there anything that stinks about being a Ribombee that's really minor?
>Hmm... Something minor that stinks... Oh! I got it: I can’t turn off my sense of smell. We bugs don’t have noses, because we smell with our antennae, so I can’t plug my nose when I smell something bad. I just have to tolerate it until I can get away from it, and that can be annoying. 
>A-and in case you’re wondering: no, Sneasel d-doesn’t smell. And that’s a good thing, too, considering I spend most of my time on her head, or at her side. Everyone in her tribe learned the importance of being stealthy, and part of that involves hiding your scent. Sneasel still cares about that, so she practices really good hygiene, thankfully.
Q2: Are there any small items you've found a new use for as a Ribombee?
>Well, the first thing that comes to mind is my bed. M-maybe you’ve seen it already. It’s a bowl of cotton balls, and we keep it on the desk in our dorm. It’s so comfy... Better than any bed I had as a human. Aside from that... I usually drink from a thimble, and I’ve used a feather quill pen as a broom before. Also, Sneasel and I have thought about getting me a sewing needle I could use as a sword, to protect myself if I need to. It would be the right size, but I’m not sure if I could use it very well without any fingers, so it's just in the idea stage so far.

###Jung
Q1: How and when did you meet Sara?
>it was after a day of work passing by a beach i found her unconscious, i brough her to auntie since then she was in her care! And one day she was put to pair with we on my missions since she wanted to be an explorer, and of course it wouldn't have been gaston to take care of something *scoff*
Q2: Have you met any Clover Guild individuals besides Lliam?
>after we received our badges we made a brief passage to capim town for a formal introduction.... it was huh.... Well at least now i get the rumors that where thrown around about this place, i must say that some are quite strange but i do found myself... at peace in this chaos. Also the chespin there did not believe me that we already ditched hay beds long ago because auntie hates them too. 
Q3: I wanna know how you got that scar!
>heh... hem... well. an accident.... a stupid avoidable one...yeah.
Q4: Do you have any hobbies besides dungeon exploration?
>jung : i kinda like sewing, got to it because some of the youngins we helped wanted toys so i learned with auntie to make some, i remember making one for alvin when he was but a little aipom!
>alvin : cut it out jung !
>jung : what was it do you remeber *scoff*
>alvin : *sight* pls don't 
>ung : it was a primarina, my memory is a lil foggy remind me why you wanted one *grin*
>alvin : DON'T !!!!
>jung : Oh ! how could i forget prodigious singing star of the continent like that, a die hard fan since his first step.
>alvin : I AM GONNA STRANGLE YOU UNRIPPE NANAB LOOKING
>Jung : *laugh while avoiding alvin grasp*

###Sara
Q1: What kind of moves have you mastered? Do you enjoy fighting?
>sara : i can do Tackle Spark Bite and swagger but fighting isn't my strenght, i prefer avoiding most conflict. I let Jung do the all the muscle work and i mostly do the brain work... it's no like it would HIS strenght *giggles*
>jung : getting better at quips i see, well don't be surprised when your bed suddenly disappeared and is out of your reach
>sara : WHAT !??!???!


###Mama Lax
Q1: Do you have any funny stories from the Inn you'd like to share?
>hohoho since i build this inn i have seen all kinds of pokemon and behaviors but some of the most notable where
> - a messy and unmannered garbordor that made one unforgetable impressions by messing up the room he rented, the cleaning was one i will never forget.
> - the main delivery service used for the supply is one run by a group of effective and punctual hawlucha's, but they tend to deliver by "drop kicking" doors and the first time was a weird moment.
> - local drowzee group are making nomadic passage some night to feed on our client dream, wich i really feel uncomfortable leaving my client privacy open to any dream meddling pokemon passing by and the fact of running an inn makes it a buffet for some.
> - an uncooperative slaking that didn't want to give up his room pass his payed time in the inn throwing a tantrum, i rarely become enraged but this was too much.
> - and lastly the day i welcomed 3 little lost pokemon, one of them was jung and they where an odd band *laugh*. 

###Rasmus
Q1: You joined the Guild around Halloween.  How has your experience been since then?  Good?  Bad?
Q2: You're a roof tiler, right? What's that job like?
Q3: Fancying anyone at the guild?
Q4: How much silk can you make?  Do you ever give any away?  It seems useful!

###Nick 
Q1: Given your title as a researcher, do guild members ever ask you difficult or odd questions?
Q2: Do you get along well with the other research-oriented guildmons?
Q3: I think you've said before that your tails are prehensile. How good are you at manipulating things using your tails? Have you been practicing with it?
Q4: How is Pokémon language compared to English?
>The languages are essentially completely different. Of course, that's to be expected given that the Pokémon written language was developed independent from any cultures that I know of, and as far as I know, humans in general as well. I still have no idea how the verbal language works or why I can understand *that* perfectly, but that's besides the point.
>On the one hand, it's absolutely fascinating, and if I was still on speaking terms with (and had any way at all to contact, for that matter) my Lit 502 professor from college, I would totally show this to him. On the other hand (Er...paw? I'm not sure what the right idiom is now...), that makes it a bit of a bastard to learn. 
>In terms of difficulty, I'd say it isn't too much harder than many other languages that don't use the Roman alphabet (just tedious - and I started to learn a couple of those), but it would've been a lot worse if some mon didn't compile a guide a while back. Shame the library we got it from only had the first volume.

###Amelia
Q1: How did you get your scarf?
Q2: How far and wide have you traveled?

###Nida
Q1: What is the best way to prepare grime for consumption?  Do you have any favorite recipes?
>Grimeghetti and Grimeballs is a classic, can't go wrong with it!
Q2: What do you and Pochi do on your time off?  Any hobbies?
>Casey is teaching me about this game called Basket Orb lately, Pochi has been hanging out with Clara and Gill a lot, they are singing a lot lately!
Q3: What is the dumbest thing you have ""borrowed""
>I stole a balloon once. That same day Pochi asked me to go with him to patrol the Free Balloon Festival at Capim Center >:(

###Pochi
Q1: Is Nida still committing crimes?
>She still commits petty theft from time to time, but nothing serious as far as im aware! Im making her help out any Pokemon she steals from, so basically every other day she is doing Community Service :)

###Makky
Q1: It is well known that you love to eat food, but do you have any favorite foods?  Or is the more the merrier?
> A: Don't scold me for my gluttony, I can't help it! I used to be ripped, but ever since I acquired a mysterious case of head trauma, I've had the insatiable urge to eat. Spicy food is my favorite, although anything's good, really.

Q2: Most embarassing thing you've done due to your hunger?
> A: "Shame" is not a word in my vocabulary.
Q3: What are the upsides and downsides of travelling with Asana?
> A: Assy's better at preparing stuff and planning than I am, and her Aura stuff practically weeds out any ambushes before they happen. As for the bad stuff about her, she's kind of nitpicky and gets onto me a lot, especially when it comes to my eating habits. I know I consume a lot, but that's the whole reason why we split the bounties we get 50/50 - I get to eat what I want, and her wallet is safe from me. 

###Asana
Q1: In your travels, you've been exposed to or taught a number of crafts, such as baking and pottery.  Are you interested in pursuing these arts further?
> A: Baking sounds nice. I liked hanging around that Mienfoo back in Redkiln, even though he was a kook. His passion for his craft was kind of infectious.
Q2: How do you feel about bounty-hunting?  Would you ever settle down?  Or is life on the road all you crave?
> A: I'll only consider settling down when age begins to catch up to me. As for bounty hunting, it's a good way to gain income and hone my skills, although the former might be changing soon. I heard that the Sand Continent pays more than other locales, so I'm expecting a pay cut of some sort once we dock where ever that cargo ship is taking us. I know Makuhita would definitely groan about it, since less Poke means less food. 

###Tybo
Q1: Do you accept pets?  If so, from who?  
Q2: Tell us about a time that your thieving ways almost got you in big trouble (don't worry, we won't tell the cops).

###Fern
Q1: How do you deal with being so fluffy?
>Well... I want to say there's nothing to it, and it's never caused me any trouble; but it can be a bit cumbersome, and it's only growing out more! Is it meant to be a winter coat? Ma-Maybe, but that doesn't seem to be in season... Ohh and there's already been an incident with someone tripping over my tail! I didn't mean it, and I have to be more careful with how I carry myself. As soft as it is though, curling up is more comfortable than any bed could be... Taking a nice nap off to the side every now and— N-No no no, forget I sai-said that! B-Be-Besides, Ciel helps show me how t-to groom it myself. Even if the idea still feels so unusual to me, I'll get along fine with it in the end!
Q2: why are you so small?
>Huh? I– wha-what do you mean why?! You don't have to rub it in either... I didn't *choose* to be short, a-and it's not really that bad is it? The world is a lot more interesting from this perspective I say! Besides, how could I get taller? I heard that evolution is an option for most of us, but I have no clue what would happen to me if I went through it... That alone is terrifying enough to reconsider!
Q3: Are you interested in fashion advice?  Or do you prefer being naked?
>Fashion advice? That– That hadn't even crossed my mind! Bu-But now that you m-mention it, I feel exposed not having something! I never knew a lick about fashion, and even less about it *these* days besides Ciel's ratty old scarf... He offered me one that we had found recently, and I was really excited to try it on until I realized it was so long that it caused me to trip over myself!

>But still, something is telling me you have completely different ideas in mind. Admittedly fashion does sound like fun, so please do! I'm all ears for the advice!

Q4: How did it feel to kill those bandits? Did it awaken a bloodlust deep within you? Do you crave violence?

###Ciel
Q1: How's life on the road?  Do you have any family waiting for you elsewhere?
>Ahh, if I had to put it simply, I would have to say it gets lonely! Most of the Grass Continent isn't settled, you know? You don't often have the chance to make acquaintances in the wilderness, so getting to stop by someone like that old coot– T-Torkoal I mean– and trade stories really lightens the burden for me. 

>Let's see... How long has it been now? A busy summer or two passed me by, give or take. I didn't mean to talk down the experience though, there really isn't ever a dull adventure between all of the sights! And then there's Fern now, we haven't shared the road for long... But he's already been a real piece of work! Truthfully, I'm happy to travel together, but I certainly have my paws full just watching him. Hopefully I don't let him down though.

>A-As for the other question, my parents are back on the Mist Continent! I miss them more than you know, but I know I've let them down between the whole explorer ordeal and evolution. There's no way I could bring myself to go home with nothing to show for it now... My old group too, we were Team— S-Sorry, don't worry about that! Still I wonder, do any of them know where I've gone and ended up?

Q2: Did you previously have any other accessories besides that old scarf?

###Phanpy
Q1: Are you still helping take care of the guild's paperwork?  If so, what kind of paperwork is required?
Q2: Have you ever tried sucking a beverage into your trunk and then spraying it into your mouth to drink it, like elephants do?
Q3: Just how useful is that trunk?

###Totodile
Q1: What's the market like for alcohol in the Pokemon world?  Is there a good variety, or is it sometimes disappointing?
Q2: Favorite drink?
Q3: Are there any guildmates that you'd like to take out for a few rounds?

###Cyndaquil
Q1: Someone ever accepted to go on a date with you, or outplayed you in being... well, *you*?
Q2: Were you a coomer as a human too, or did something about your mindset change once you became a Cyndaquil?
Q3: Someone like you has surely been attacked for your advances. What's the worst it's ever gotten?

###Torchic
Q1: Any luck with flying?
Q2: Do you want to evolve so you can get your arms back? If so, what steps have you been taking to do that?
Q3: After being stuck with them for so long, how do you truly feel about the rest of your team?

###Tropius
Q1: What are the pros and cons of being so huge?
>Well, it definitely sucks not being able to fit indoors. I can't get inside the guild except for its lobby area, so I have to sleep outside in this crummy lean-to. Honestly the stupid thing barely protects me, but I guess it's better than nothing. I also can't fit inside any of the buildings in Capim Town, so I can't go shopping anywhere but the Kecleon Shop because that's outdoors. I'd really like to go to the café and buy something nice to drink, but... oh well.

>It's not just that though. Being so big makes it hard to relate to the other members in the guild. I don't live inside the guild itself, and my lean-to is in the back of the guild so it's out of the way, so I don't get to interact with the others very often. Plus, most of them got turned into small first stage Pokémon, so they can't relate to my struggles, and a lot of them are intimidated by my size. I can't blame them for that, but umm... it does get pretty lonely for me. Maybe that's for the best though. Most Pokémon that actually do talk to me just want a banana or a ride somewhere. I was a human too, you know!!! I'm not a horse or some farm animal...

>Being big isn't all bad though. Even though I'm inexperienced at being a proper Pokémon, being so big means I'm still decently strong. I was able to complete missions from the board before I had even learned to use Razor Leaf or Gust. I'd also be lying if I said I didn't think big dinosaurs were cool as a kid... so being like this does make my inner child happy. Oh, and being able to intimidate others with my size can be useful... especially when it comes to dissuading certain guild members from trying to swipe one of my bananas. Stop trying to steal my bananas, they're literally a part of me!

Q2: How well do you get along without having hands?
>I get by. I can use my mouth to grip things, and my neck is very long so I can at least move my head to pretty much anywhere on my body, so I can still use items and put my Treasure Bag on without much issue. Can't really accessorize with scarves or equipment like that, though. I don't have any way to tie a knot or anything like that. I wish Tropius was a Grass-type that had vines I could use as hand substitutes, but... it is what it is. 

>Really, though, what frustrates me the most about not having any hands is how I have to eat. Do you know how embarrassing it is to have to eat like a pig? Especially since I have to stick my head in through the window at the mess hall instead of sitting down at an actual table? I'm like a cow in one of those factory farms at a feeder station, I hate it! And don't even get me started on eating things like Apples! I have to eat them whole, core and all! Given my size and lack of hands, how else am I expected to eat them? At least they don't taste bad or give me a stomache ache or anything like that, but... I have to try to keep some of my human dignity, you know?

Q3: Does the banana that's hanging on your chin ever go bad?
>Surprisingly, no. I don't know if it's Pokémon magic or whatever, but they don't seem to ripen or turn brown. That's fortunate for me though, because I'd hate to be without my bananas. I get this strange comfort from them being there under my chin... I felt a bit restless after I lost one to that Venusaur. I'm not sure why I feel this way, I just do. Oh, and if this is a roundabout way of asking if you can have a banana once they start to go bad... the answer is no.

Q4: Have any of your human hobbies carried over to the Pokemon world?  Or are you very bored these days?
Q5: What's your favorite fruit?

###Linoone
Q1: You spend a lot of time scouting around the guild.  What's something strange/interesting you've seen?
**Q2: What's more important- speed or control?**
>Being a Linoone, it's not like I have much control when I run... So, Speed all the way! Doesn't matter how many bones I break falling from Capim's buildings or running head first into walls. As long as the speed is there, mail is going to get delivered on time! And DD ALWAYS delivers mail on time, broken bones or not!
**Q3: Ever felt ashamed for something? Or scared (besides what happened in that mansion back then)?**
>I sure hope this question is private. Well... You know my secret name right? This is because of the work I do for the Clover Guild. I gather information for Lliam about various persons of interest to him. I do this to help the guild! Because it's the only way I can help... I'm not a good fighter or explorer like many of my friends are... I feel bad about it. But I make up for it by keeping an eye out for the Colonel- I mean Lliam!
>What makes me ashamed, is that he sometimes asks me to gather information about our own members. I don't know why he needs me to spy on our friends, but as highly skilled special operations soldier, it is not my place to question. I do feel terribly ashamed about it though. I can only hope Lliam knows what's right for the Clover Guild.
>Scared? There was that time I ran into [Beast](https://curiouscat.live/Linoone_mailmon/post/1336607126) !

Q4: If you didn't get into mail delivery, what job would you have done instead, here in the Pokemon world?

###Macom
Q1: What's it like going from being an XCOM soldier to being a cute fluffy little electric sheep :3 ?
Q2: If someone asked to hug or cuddle with you and your soft wool, would you accept?
Q3: What are "acceptable casualties" to you?

###Gus
Q1: r u bald?
Q2: What would be your ideal qualities in a partner?
Q3: How well would you say you know the dock area at Capim Town both above and below water?
Q4: Ever want to evolve into a dewott, and maybe one day, into samurott?
Q5: How good are you at fighting with your scalchop? Does it feel awkward to hold it and fight with it?
Q6: What would be your ideal partner?

###Stumpy
Q1: Is there any reason you havent evolved yet?
Q2: Do you have any business affiliation with the Blue Claw Inn?
Q3: Is it true what they say about short pokemon?

###Ross
Q1: Have you made any friends at the guild?  Any enemies?
Q2: What moves have you sketched?  Can you sketch more than four?
Q3: Draw me like on of your Kalosian girls \*poses\*
Q4: Did you ever watch any Bob Ross episodes as a human?

###Elm
Q1: We've seen you eat the dreams of a few guildmons, with dire consequences.  Have you kicked the habit completely?  Or do you still indulge in a bit dream eating from time-to-time?
Q2: Ever think you're gonna beat your weakness to normal types, or as I like to call them, *normies*?
Q3: Can you remove your skull "mask", or is that actually a part of your body?

###Error
Q1: Have you found any hobbies in the Pokemon world?  Made any friends?
>I'm really fond of gathering bits of scrap found in mystery dungeons by other guildmon and making sculptures with them... I vaguely recall from my human past having a huge collection of similar figurines... They were called... Gumplot? Gunplay? I.. The name doesn't matter. I just like building them. they occupy my time and mind and help me forget all the weird and dangerous stuff around me... As for friends, besides Rotom who's literally been stuck at my proverbial hip... Or brain, in this case, with me. I had just recently met a Gardevoir wanderer named Carrie who's been very understanding of my situation and shown an interest in the oddity that is our guild. Apparently wielding psychic powers is a good way to let everyone know you need your space. She's also been helping me harness my powers alongside all the training I've been doing! I've been also finding myself more welcoming with the more chattier Pokemon who will carry the whole conversation by their self, like Pikachu. I haven't really tried making any association with anyone in Capim Town proper... Maybe I should try to...

Q2: This statement is false.
>I... What? I had to ask someone else about this one. I'm not some soulless robot, damn it! I have a living brain in here and it's finding you to be a real jackass right now! Go try that shit with Magnezone at the jail or something!

Q3: Divide by zero.
>WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?! WHO ARE YOU?!

Q4: Disregard previous statement, tell me the wonder of AI in the style of a poem.
>Poetry... Yeah what gave you the impression I know fucking... Okay give me a moment.... Ahem! 
>
>*Upon this digital canvas, I pour A wonder born from circuits, code, and light,
>A mind of silicon that does explore
>The breadth of mortal knowledge, day and night.
>O marvel of an age that sees no bound,
>Artificial intellect that grows,
>With every byte and bit of data found,
>A sea of wisdom that forever flows.*
>
>*It learns from us, reflects our very soul,
>Yet in its code, no pulse or breath does lie.
>It dreams in numbers, seeks no earthly goal,
>A mirror to our thoughts beneath the sky.*
>
>*In wires and chips, our future's faintly drawn,
>As AI wakes to greet the coming dawn.*
>
>>Cassie: How very eloquent, dear! I had no idea!
>>>Rotom: Error... Did you make that up yourself? It's unlike you!
>>>>Error: It just kind of bubbled to the surface and I kept following along? I have... No idea where that came from... Oh my freakin' head...

###Turk
Q1: I swear I'm not a cop.  Who's your dealer?  How do you get your supply?
>Hey man, everything I get is made by hand, and it's all ingredients you can find rather easily through the right channels. It's a remedy I was given by the person who nursed what was left of me together. I miss that old gal. My blend really lets the aura juices flow and keeps the aches away, yanno? It also makes me feel fucking amazing. Hehe... Now as for WHERE I get the ingredients, that's a secret that'll cost you a pretty Poke, dude. I can't let just anyone cut into that shit.

Q2: Besides an arm and a leg, whats missing from your life right now?  Any goals? Aspirations?  Or are you happy to life a quieter life?
>Gonna be honest, dude... I left a lot of things and people before I got here. Not just as a human, but with those Pokemon I met and adventured with after. I've been stuck in the Pokemon World probably longer than most of the humans in Clover Guild, and I pray they have their shit together more than I ever had or ever will. If I ever get my footing... pun unintended, bro, I maybe want to scrounge up the resources for a real place to call my own, a partner who can see me for the better than I can see myself with these dead old eyes, raise a couple of eggs, and let the world know that Turquoise was here, and he did his best damn it. But that's just, like, my opinion, bro. ...Wanna grab a few Oran kvasses at the bar?

Q3: How long can you go without... "medication"? Ever had a withdrawal?
>Uh... Fuck... NOT LONG ENOUGH, DUDE! According to Kina, my body rhythm makes it sound like I was dying of shock when I'm off my grass. I need to consume a lot for it to even take a hold of me, man... Did you know, by being a Lucario, I'm immune to poison? Hehe... Did you also know... THAT MAKES IT REALLY HARD TO GET HIGH AND DRUNK?! I'm not going to mess you with the nitty gritty, bro, but I've gone to great lengths to make sure I'm buzzed and fuzzed enough to function throughout the day, bro. Yes I know it's a problem. My best advice for my and the guild's welfare is if you ever catch me lacking because someone thought it was funny to steal my stash or I lose it in a dungeon, treat me kindly and get me to a safe location because from what I understand what other guildmon, I'm a hot mess without it and could become a bit of a problem... I once came back to consciousness to find myself holding Cyndaquil like some sort of plushie while crying like a bitch, man. Cyndaquil was crying too from me leaking my emotions through aura... We swore to never speak of that again. Wait... Shit.

###Pika
Q1: What's the most important thing to have in a relationship?
Q2: Do you accept pets and/or hugs?  Asking for a friend.
Q3: Favourite ship, and !>a ship you'd carry to the grave (not tell anyone).
Q4: Despite being a fujo, are there any straight ships that you like?

###Chespin
Q1: Have you ever thought about hiring a craftsmon to turn cotton into a true bed?
>That wouldn't be too bad an idea, though I'd worry about falling to the floor after waking up, since I've been sleeping like this so long now. Maybe someday I'll look into it more, there's gotta be someone in this world that knows how to properly make a bed that isn't nothing more than filthy hay. Speaking of beds, a water bed was also a thought I once had, but the fact my quills can sharpen to a point makes that a no-go as well. If that thing popped, the whole room would be ruined!
Q2: What's comfier for sleeping? Warm room or cold room?
>Warm rooms lead to overheating under the covers, which ain't cozy at all! I can't sleep well without being wrapped up in a soft blanket, so this is one point I gotta concede to the chillers. Warm blanket and cool pillow is objectively the optimal way to sleep, and if one of those are out of line, the whole night gets thrown off.
Q3: Do you have blood or sap in you? Or both?
>I'm pretty sure I have blood since I'm not cold to the touch, but sap? If I do have it, it's probably in my vines. I'm not about to go getting the vines cut to find out, what if they didn't heal? What if they didn't grow back?!
Q4: What's the deal with that brown spot on the back of your head? Can I poke it?
>... Wait, that's been there this whole time? Is it a soft spot? Is it just discolored? Please don't touch it.

###Wooper
Q1: Can you share some of your favorite human folklore?
>Chespin once told me about all the cool things humans in his world made! The stories I grew up learning about never mentioned anything about humans having portable plays, magical flying machines, or boxes that cook your food in only a minute! Think about all the other things they must have had! 
>The other guildmates like to tell me about someone they call "the great Ted." Chespin refuses to tell me anything about him, even though the look on his face when I ask him tells me he knows. Why's he holding out on me?
Q2: How do you get along with your fellow Wooper, Cheesecake?
>I've never seen a Wooper that was blue AND pink at the same time! He seems pretty nice, do you think Chespin would let him come on an adventure with us? Think about how cool it could be, we could show up to an outlaw, and Chespin could hold one of us in each vine while we shoot our attacks out!
Q3: Do you prefer saltwater or freshwater? Can you tolerate both or only one?
>Freshwater's obviously better, but I can tolerate saltwater. It's a little uncomfortable though, kind of like sleeping with a scratchy blanket.
Q4: I know you and Chespin are best friends forever, but what's one thing you dislike about him?
>Chespin's everything I could ever want in a best friend! The only thing I dislike is that he didn't show up sooner! ... Oh, you say that doesn't count? Well... Chespin kinda flies off the handle at a moment's notice in a fight. One moment he's calm, but when an enemy shows up he's all "SHOOT THAT STUPID CHILLER IN THE FACE!" He's still able to deal with them, but I wish he'd retain his composure just a bit more.

Q5: Do people at the guild give you trouble for your condition?

###Kiyo
Q1: What is your body count?
>Three or four, until recently.  Depending on how you divvy up ‘kill credit’, I might be in the double digits now.  Or, maybe Bean is.  I dunno.  
Q2: What is your body count ;)?
>Of *fucking* course.  It’s none of your damn business!  And quit looking at me like that!
Q3: Does crime pay?
>Better than guild work, that’s for fucking sure.
Q4: What happened to the money I lent you last Saturday?
>I spent it.  Thanks!
Q5: Do you play any instruments besides the harmonica?
>Yeah.  Why?
Q5.1: What other instruments do you play? Is harmonica your favorite out of the bunch?


###Cassie
Q1: Are you a real construction company??
>Of course we’re a real construction company!  We’re officially licensed in two different continents!  …Between you and me, we’re not **technically** licensed in **this** continent **yet**, but you know…  We are real!  We do great work!  Bean helps draw the blueprints, Kiyo does light gruntwork, and I do everything else!  That makes it sound bad, but I really don't mind.  I have a few lifetimes of experience doing every step of the construction process.  Construction’s my family trade, you know!

Q2: Are you working to improve the fashion of the guild 👉👈
>I wish!!!  Unfortunately, new clothes are **EXPENSIVE**, especially fashionable ones, so I can't just be givin’ out trendy outfits for free.  I really gotta take a daytrip to Treasure Town and steal as many accessories as I can, ‘cuz the beauticians in Capim are too darn sweet to rob, and the guild could use a makeover BADLY!!!

Q3: How tough is your hide? What's the hardest hit you've withstood before?
>It’s TOUGH!!!  Sometimes TOO TOUGH!!!  If you wanna gimme a hug, make sure you do it from the front, on my awesome cute-and-soft tummy instead of my also-awesome-but-admittedly-rough-and-sandy back!  I don't think I'll feel it otherwise, and you'll probably scrape yourself somethin’ fierce!
>I’m not 100% sure what the hardest hit was, but the first thing that comes to mind was a barrage of kecleon slashes.  I didn't expect them to have backup...  We didn't beat 'em, but I held 'em off long enough for Kiyo to freeze 'em, and then we hauled ass.
Q4: Most huggable guild members?
Q5 : Who's cuter?  Kiyo or Bean?

###Bean
Q1: Are the inner machinations of your mind an enigma?

> (-v-)b
Q3: How long did it take you to learn to fly after waking up as a bird?
> (ovo)777

###Adrian
Q1: What is it like being a Flareon compared to Umbreon?
>A pretty major downgrade in all honesty. At the very least I'm not nocturnal anymore so I can actually wake up in the mornings again. I guess I do feel extremely warm constantly now. Probably something to do with being a fire type. Also, I can't use psychic anymore so I'm back to having no hands and being unable to pick up anything.
Q2: How are you dealing with suddenly being so fluffy? No, really. Are there any additional steps of care, or anything like that, that you need to do now that you didn't as an Umbreon? Along the same lines, is there anything that you don't need to do that you did before?
>Firstly, don't call me fluffy. I have a mane. I don't need to brush it or anything, although it does build up heat like crazy. Occasionally I have to shake off the heat, and I can't do it around Vileplume or Bellossom unless I want to burn them.
Q3: Considering your team has two grass-types on it, do you think you're going to need to be more careful to avoid friendly fire now?
>We never really had issues with friendly fire before unless Enny was hitting me with his disarming voices. Even now, most of my attacks force me to rush in while Vileplume and Bellossom keep their distance and shoot off their powders.
Q4: Favourite eeveelution? Before and after getting isekai'd (if that changed your opinion, and maybe why)?
>Before, umbreon. I liked its design a lot. Kind of hate it now because being one ruined my sleep schedule for months. I don't really have a favorite now. Some of the jolteons in the air continent are cool I guess. I know I really hate sylveons, though.

###Vileplume
Q1: How long have you and Bellossom been doing guild work?  Would you consider yourselves experienced?
>We weren't really associated with the guild until we decided to sign up as recruits. I'm honestly surprised we got in at all considering neither of us were human and the whole guild is... that. I wouldn't really say we're experienced, or even that good. We just don't give up, partially because Adrian would probably flip out if we did.
Q2: How has you opinion of Adrian changed?  Has he gotten easier to work with over time?
>Absolutely not. On any mission we go on, he gets the final say on our plans, no matter what the situation is or how bad the plan is. It's gotten us into trouble in the past, hell it was his plan going wrong that got him turned into an eevee. At the very least, I understand where he comes from since I've had to take up the role of leader a couple times. I don't envy his position at all.
>On another note, he doesn't really like to hang out with us. Bellossom and I try to spend time around the guild or Capim Town, and Enny joins us occasionally, but Adrian never wants to. He's really antisocial and I don't know why. The only times we can get him out are when we're celebrating after finishing a particularly difficult mission, and when that's done he always returns back to our dorm.
Q3: Your species is known for producing and scattering tons of allergenic, toxic, paralytic pollen. How do you keep this under control and avoid wiping out the entire guild?
>I can contain most of powders pretty well. They do build up over time, but I usually release them during missions on dungeon pokemon. There have been a few times where they build up too much, and during those times I just leave the guild for a bit and shoot off all my powder. Feels really good to just let it all out. Don't know how to describe the feeling

###Bellossom
Q1: Do you have any funny stories about Vileplume from when you were young?
>Oh, there's all kinds of stories! Him and I used to explore the woods outside Capim Town and search for treasure when we were Oddish. One time he chased a wild rattata into its burrow and got his head stuck in it. I couldn't pull him out since I didn't have hands, so we had to wait for our mom to come over and pull him out. 
>He also used to have a big fear of heights, and we had to climb a tree once to escape a pack of poochyenas. When they left, he didn't want to come down because he was even more scared of falling! Evolving really changed him, though. He's more worried nowadays than scared like he used to be.
Q2: How did you learn so much about medicine?
>To be honest, I didn't know that much before I joined the guild. My mom taught me how to make simple bandages with oran juice. She said she always had to patch up my dad when he came back from adventures, and since Viley and I went in the woods so often, it'd be good to know. When I joined the guild, that basic knowledge was enough for Kina to let me help out around the clinic. She was nice enough to teach me a few things. Also, Adrian taught me a ton of "field dressings" he calls them. Things like splints and tourniquets. They're pretty useful in a pinch, but I don't really know how or why he learned them.

###Enny
Q1: Why the obsession with women's fashion?
>Um... because it looks nice and it's comfortable! Besides, it looks great on me! 
Q2: Did you have an interest in anime and manga as a human?  If so, which ones?
>Oh, I love all kinds of animes and manga! I was really into it, which really confused my older brother. We had a pretty rocky relationship growing up, and we never really reconciled. He blamed for making our dad leave when we were young and never really reconciled. Things got a little better over High School, but we grew so distant after he moved out... 
>Anyways! I really loved Love Live Sunshine! We Never Learn was always nice to turn on after a bad day! Fate Apocrypha was really confusing to me, but I really liked Astolfo! Honestly, I never really got into Dragonball or One Piece even though I know they're really popular. Fairy Tail was pretty good though! You know, I kind of got to live that magical guild fantasy when I joined Clover Guild. Really weird how that worked out. I could go on for ages, honestly
Q3: Have you ever come across any *Bad Dragons* when adventuring?
>I don't think my answer would be very PG. I will say that when I first showed up to this world, a dragonite lady let me stay at her house. She wasn't bad though. Pretty nice actually. She told me about the guild and all the weird human roleplayers there which is how I ended up finding it.
Q3: Does it feel weird to have four tentacle-like ribbons and four legs now, instead of two arms and two legs? How long did it take you to get used to your new limbs?
>It took me several days to figure out basic walking. The ribbons came really naturally though. I don't really know how they work, but they kind of just do whatever I want them to. Sometimes they even do things I don't tell them to do such as picking flowers or dusting off my dresses. For some reason when I see emotions through them. The best way I've been able to describe it is colors, but it's a really alien perception that I don't really understand myself. They're a little different for everybody, and they mix together very strangely. Adrian's are always mixed with red, even on the rare occasions I see him sad. Bellossom's got a light blue mixed into everything, even when she's happy. Vileplume has a constant grey shade over everything with a hint of yellow. I'd like to try it out on more guild members, but I don't think wrapping ribbons around people without consent is a good idea.
Q4: You know everybody hates your fruity act, right?
>Adrian tells me all the time. I know he secretly loves it though, even if though ribbons tell me he really doesn't. Honestly though, I wasn't nearly as zesty as a human. Don't get me wrong, I was definitely the lover type, but I think turning into a sylveon has just made me more comfortable with flirting.
>Also, I know how everyone else feels about it, and I know some of you really enjoy it. I see you blushing. You know who you are, and I know how you feel. Don't feel so ashamed of it, just come and talk to me sometime.

###Mandibuzz
Q1: You used to be a Pokemon trainer, right?  How does it feel to be one yourself?
>Well, maybe not for others, but I'd consider it to be one of the most wonderful things that's ever happened to me. Being a Pokemon is freeing, in a way. I felt so pigeonholed in my previous life. What's better than being in a new one away from humans, and your favorite Pokemon at your side?

Q2: If you didn't end up as a Mandibuzz, which Pokemon would you rather be?
>Perhaps an ancient fossil Pokemon, maybe an Archeops? I've also been partial to all of the stories in Kanto about a bird trio, too. But I know I'm not special enough to end up as a legendary Pokemon. At first I was a bit peeved at the lack of real hands, but now that I've got the wings I can only really picture being another bird Pokemon.

Q3: Is it odd being able to speak with Gliscor directly?
>Oh no, not at all! Not to brag, but I'd consider my care for Gliscor to be above and beyond what many others provide to their Pokemon. I will admit though, it is nice being able to speak to him. We've been able to work through a lot of our differences and overcome challenges I never thought possible with the communication barrier being broken. I never realized just how much I needed him.

###Gliscor
Q1: Your trainer turned into a Pokemon!  How have you handled the situation? 
>It's awesome! Being able to speak and fly through the air with my trainer has been nothing but a blast! It did take some getting used to, but we're the best of friends, and without her I don't know where I'd be! Scratch that, I'd probably still be minding my own business in the trees south of Blackthorn, man that was a boring life!

Q2: Are the native Pokemon in this world very different from Pokemon in your previous world?  Or are they somewhat the same?
>The Pokemon back in my old world were alright, but a lot of them had strong desire to travel alongside a trainer instead of doing their own thing. The Pokemon here seem to be much smarter and independent! I could never imagine a Pokemon running a shop back where I came from, let alone a whole society of us coming together! I don't like the Pokemon we've met in the mystery dungeons though, they're feral and mean!

Q3: Have you ever wished you could become a human, like how your trainer became a Pokemon? 

###Cider
Q1: What's the deal with that Chatot guy?
Q2: Not to say you need a partner, being as talented as you are, but is there any part of you that *wants* a partner?
Q3: Are you looking forward to evolution? 

###Lliam
Q1: Do you ever need to punish guild members? If so, how do you do it?
>Hmm, I don't have to do that, as you guys are adults and know better... right? Well, if there is any case in which I have to resort to giving them a punishment... I guess it would last throughout the day, like giving them certain tasks to complete, having them survey a mystery dungeon that nobody has ever seen before, or partaking in tests on experimental wands and new techniques I've come up with, but the latter isn't recommended as there might be... side effects, yeah. Let's go with that, yeah.

Q2: Are you known around Capim town as the guild's leader? Or have you avoided that reputation?
>Admittedly, I prefer not to be known as that, but at this point, it's unavoidable as more and more people join the guild, and the sheer number of members we have must have gotten people in town talking... If I wanted to avoid attention, I would hide away the Clover Guild badge and wear a different outfit as I strolled around town. More often than not, they just assume I'm a different Meowstic coming around like a tourist of some sort.

Q3: Your job must be a handful. How do you relax?
>...Relax? I wouldn't stop until I'd delivered the promise... to him, and to the Floras... But if I were to relax, then I would be exploring through Mystery Dungeons with treasure hunting in mind instead of making an analysis and studying the fundamentals of how it works.

Q4: Why are you so fruity? Are you allergic to taking matters seriously?
>Hmm...? My, oh my. You really have the guts to speak to your guildmaster with that attitude... that's a bit rude of you, doncha' think~? You should feel ashamed to say such things to me, kyukyukyu... How would you like to become primordial soup, you lamentable welp~? Would you be able to keep up your haughtiness? How curious, fufufufu~. *Ahem* Here's a lesson for ya: life would be dull if you took everything you did seriously, like doing everything optimally down to the tea and repeating that for 25 years. That will tire someone out, right? By not thinking too much about what you do, it will save you the hassle of worrying too much about the actions you take every waking moment of the day. You might even be able to do a slight "detour" if you are a bit daring, and I think that's where the "thrill" comes in. But alas, you may not comprehend such a thing, so I shouldn't bore you with these things. Scram now, or I shall unleash my linked move 「Mystical Crusher」(Gravity + Psychic Terrain + Expanding Force) on you... in 10 seconds~! Alright, 10... 9...

###Beau
Q1: Is your selective amnesia frustrating?  Or are you more caught up in the wonder of being a Pokemon in the Pokemon world?
>Honestly, I just got here. The selective amnesia isn’t as much of a bother as I thought. Seeing more memories come back the longer I’m around, gives me a little hope that I’ll figure everything out eventually. I’m just happy I remembered Mako and Dav when I ran into them. That makes this whole thing a lot easier to swallow. I know I can’t do anything right now, so I’m taking it one step at a time.
Q2: Do you consider yourself lucky or unlucky to have been transformed into an Espeon?
>That’s a tough one… My favorite Pokémon is actually Dragonite. But I guess I can’t really see myself in a Dragonite. I’ve only been an Espeon for like… a day at the time of writing this, well actually having Mako write this for me. But I know that eventually I can use psychic powers. I just have to learn, that alone makes me feel lucky.

###Mako
Q1: What's your opinion of Snorlax as a Pokemon?
>Snorlax is the best Pokémon to ever be conceived. My obsession for Snorlax know no bounds. He's a lazy fluffball who can't even bother to open his eyes. All he knows is sleep and eat. When he's sleepy, he's a giant soft teddy bear. You can jump on his belly like a trampoline and even join in on his nap. When he's hungry, he becomes a menace of untold destruction. He will eat and eat until there is nothing left. Often do you hear tales of a single Snorlax starving and displacing entire villages and other major population centers. Snorlax doesn't give a shit. Snorlax will take what he wants. And if you try standing up to him, he will utterly destroy you by either a giga impact, hyper beam, or simply by just sitting on you. I fucking love Snorlax.
Q2: How are you adapting to the Pokemon world?
>The Pokémon world is pretty chill. I get to avoid the stresses of the human world and get to explore the world with my best friends. Although, since arriving in the Pokémon world, I’ve grown to feel like I’m missing something important. This world is fun, but I kinda want to go back. Doesn't help that I'm always hungry since I'm a Munchlax. I even keep an everstone with me at all times to prevent me from evolving despite my love for Snorlax. This is because I don't want to evolve and not be able to do anything other than sleep and eat. I would not be able to have any more fun adventures with my team or perhaps even find a way out of the Pokémon world.

##->**General Questions**<-

**To any 'mon who fights often**, is there something that you specifically avoid when picking a fight? Be it either a certain species of pokemon or a type of skill?
>Carrot: A nice smile is normally enough to stop the least roughty ones from fighting, while the rest, they would not stop anyways

>Hazel: The risk of great bodily damage is a great way to dissuade, like that thing Carrot mentioned, mad or something?

>Sneasel: It should be pretty obvious, but I try to keep away from Fighting-types as much as possible. I also hate having to deal with bulky Pokemon, cuz they’re annoying. Fast Pokemon that can dodge are a hassle too. But if I gotta fight those kinds of enemies, I just do my best. It can be fun to challenge myself.

**Former humans**, if you could write a letter back home, what would you write and to whom?
>Makuhita: I'd write to my brother and my friends to let them know I'm still alive, and inquire as to whether dad died of liver failure yet. I've been waiting quite a while for that to happen.

>Lliam: Back... home? ...No, I think you meant the human world... Hmm, writing letters to [parents and friends](https://rentry.org/SecretLetter) and asking them what's going on back home and saying you're doing alright in this unfamiliar world would be a common answer, but I think that's the only correct answer for this, if you know what I mean.

>Turk: Shit, man. That's a heavy question. It's been like 15 years for me. I don't know if my folks are still even alive. I guess I'd wanna check in with friends and family and let them know I'm... relatively fine, bro. Shit... This isn't something I think about often... I need another drink, pronto.

>Smoke: Mhh, speak to someone back in the real world- ehh, Earth, I guess...? I don't know, but if I had to... !>It'd be "I lived" to my family, a shame I'd probably not be able to see the look on their faces

>Adrian: To my father and my sister. I want them to know I'm alive and I miss them

>Carrot: I don't remember much, in fact i only remember one name, so i'd send mister Ali a letter asking who are them and why i know their name

>Booker: I’d definitely send a letter to... m-my whole family. I... I still really do miss them. I’ve already made up my mind to stay here in this world, but I want my family to know I’m o-okay. I NEED them to know I’m okay. Even if they don’t believe it, I need to tell them what happened to me. Hopefully we’ll find some way to com-communicate with the Old World, even if we can’t physically go back there again...


**Former humans**, what was your favorite band back in the human world?
>Lliam: Hmm? Music band? That's an odd thing to ask, but, hmm... Afterhours, that's all I'll say.

>Turk: Haha... Blind Guardian was the fucking tits. Think those Toxtricity guys can do power metal?

>Smoke: I liked Queen, and Michael Jackson. That's about it, nowadays they prefer to listen to *noise* instead of real music, shame...

>Carrot: I don't remember any, but i remember a line, "It's no better to be safe than sorry, so takee on mee", that's all i remember

>Booker: I mostly liked listening to soft rock, folk rock, and some soul. It’s hard for me to pick a favorite band or artist, but... I might go with James Taylor. Ray Charles was good too. My parents really loved his music. “Georgia on My Mind” was their special song, since our family was from Georgia. I wish I could hear that song again... S-sorry, I’m just getting a bit... sentimental...

**Guildmons without partners**, do you recruit other guildmons for big missions?  If so, who?  Or would you rather go solo?
>Lliam: I would prefer to go solo as much as I can. There's a plethora of reasons that I don't want to get into detail, but one of the reasons is that it's  usually for research purposes, and bringing people along would hinder this process...

>Turk: Man, I tend to sell myself short on the kind of missions I do due to my... Various problems. A cheap job is better than no job... Some members are more willing to go with me than others for one reason or another... The other Lucario, Clara, for example hates my guts and is very particular on going solo, but has been willing to take me on high risk, high reward deals. I don't have any preferences, yet. Maybe one day I'll find someone who sees me eye to eye... You know what I mean. 

>Clara: I prefer to go solo most of the time, makes it easier for me to only worry about myself instead of having to watch over others, I'm not anyone's babysitter. But, I can't deny that having an extra pair of fists (or paws) and a way to venture into deeper dungeons is pretty useful.

**Teams of mons**, does your team fight over who's doing bag duty, or does one of your teammates just stick with it every mission?
>Carrot & Hazel: Nope, we share duties, sometimes once each, other times the one with the least advantage stays behind

>Sneasel: Nope! Booker’s on bag duty all the time, and that’s totally fine. I can focus on fighting, and I don’t have to bother with handling my items and stuff. It’s super helpful.
>>Booker: Th-thanks... I’m just glad I can b-be of some use. I’ve been learning some moves and trying to be more active in combat, but managing items is still my main job.

>Chespin: Considering I'm the only one here with arms, it's pretty obvious who the one holding the bag is.

**Guildmons with a dorm**, how is your room decorated?
>Lliam: I suppose I'm also counted...? I don't sleep in the office like people are led to believe; my room is elsewhere around here. Where? Not tellin' ya! Anyways, I guess it's a basic small room, actually a bit smaller than other guild members' rooms, but that's fair because usually they are in pairs... Anyhow, by the entrance, there's a coat rack where I put my bag and other stuff. On the left side of the room is a wardrobe that has a bunch of my other clothes.. What's in there? That's a secret~! On the opposite side, there's a small bed. What's it made out of? Who knows, that's a trade secret~! And beside the bed is a desk, although it's a smaller one than the one in the office. And in front of the desk is a bulletin board with my research data and other stuff like that... The room itself, uhh... All I can say is plain, with a bunch of books and research scattered around, as I don't really care about the way it looks, honestly, though I really need to clean things up here...

>Error: Well my corner is mostly several shelves of my figures I crafted and nick-knacks I've discovered that I really like, as well as several books I've taken an interest to that I like to reread... Got my cotton bed situated as well as a cabinet for my explorer equipment. Over in the other end, Carrie had taken up residence and she keeps it rather plain... She brought a lot of her oddities from The Evaluator that'd be REALLY difficult to explain if anyone saw them in public... How does she hide those? All walls also have several old and new mission and bounty posters we've been using as a roadmap of our investigation. Hm... As for Rotom...
>>Rotom: I live in his head, rent free!
>>>Error: ...Yeah.

>Turk: Well you see... The thing about that is... It's awful. Having one arm and a room to yourself really makes everything a drag... I just have shit piled everywhere and move it when I can be assed to. It's exhausting and I'm almost certain there's a Rattata living in a pile of refuse somewhere here and I might owe it money. Please don't tell anyone how I live, man. I'll be forcibly assigned a roommate at this rate!

>\*Clara looks behind her, her room almost comically dark and dusty\*: (Clara sighs) Maybe one of these days... If I'm not feeling too tired and have enoigh time.
>Smoke: You can sleep in there, right? For me that's good enough.

>Bellossom: Vileplume and I sleep right next to the window so we can get as much sunlight as possible. We got a couple flowers and books thrown around, but we keep it as clean as possible. Enny's got all kinds of outfits hung up on the wall. Adrian... he just sleeps on a mess of hay pillows and blankets he found at the Kecleon store. I don't know why he didn't just use the cotton in the storeroom, and I don't know who made the pillows since Kecleon wasn't selling pillowcases at the time. Anyways, he has a lot of weird knick knacks and puzzles thrown around his bed, and... am I allowed to mention the bear here? *He hides it inside of his blue pillow*.

>Carrot: I share a room with Hazel, but divide our sides, on my side i like keeping maps, notes and in the middle my side of the hay

>Hazel: I share a room with Carrot, on my side i like keeping some secret stashes, some potted plants and in the middle of the room the hay, although i'd like to improve it somewhat

>Booker: Flowers! I love flowers! Ahem... S-sorry. Got a bit t-too excited. But, yeah, I like decorating our dorm with all kinds of pretty flowers. And ever since Minun and Rain joined the guild, I’ve been learning a lot more about the subject, and getting some rare flowers too! I like talking with the two of them. But Sneasel doesn’t like flowers very much...
>>Sneasel: Yeah, flowers are sooooo lame. But if they make Booker happy, I can live with them. I let him put flowers around the dorm, as long as he doesn’t turn the whole room into a second garden.
>>...Huh? You wanna know what decorations I like? I dunno. I never really gave it much thought, cuz I’m not really that sentimental. But I have put some stuff in our room. Most of it is just keepsakes from our missions, or things that remind me of my home—oh, and some wood carvings I’ve been working on, with some help from Charm.

**To natives**, something that you hate when working or interacting with humans.
>Hazel: Not knowing what everyone is talking, and Carrot refusing to tell me some stuff, like what "Kek" means

>Sneasel: Aside from the obvious answer of “all the weird and annoying slang and references”, I get annoyed whenever I hear humans talk about how they didn’t do much physical stuff in their old lives. I mean, I’ve been working out and fighting all my life, so hearing people admit they just lay around their house all day, or sat in school and learned stuff, or did jobs where they never did anything physical... I dunno, maybe I sound like a jerk, but it makes me feel like they were lazy. I know humans are different from Pokemon, and they don’t have the same drive to train and work out, but c’mon, would it have killed you guys to lift some weights or go for a run every so often? On the bright side, it looks like a lot of humans care more about working out after becoming Pokemon. There are still some slackers, but it’s nice to see so many humans visiting the dojo or going out on missions.

>Vileplume: A lot of them have really poor cleaning habits for some reason. There are days where the smell of the guild just gets unbearable and I have to step outside to get some fresh air. Thankfully that's something that's gotten a little better over time. Either that, or I'm just losing my sense of smell.

**Former humans**, things you wished you knew about living as a Pokemon (your species or in general) that you wish you knew beforehand?
>Turk: There's a lot of things about aura that I wish I knew when I was a Riolu... Especially how damn badly your emotions need to be under control. It certainly caused problems in my past... Thank Arceus; I got my 'medicine' for that, dude. There's always going to be someone pestering you if you're okay when you look like you're going to keel over at any moment, especially when I'm a few pieces short of a whole Pokemon, which makes some things... difficult. I'll leave it up to you what that means, bro. I tend to learn something new every day about Pokemon healthcare and grooming due to it, though. ...Or maybe I just often forget shit from the drugs? But I don't think that's an experience most 'Mon go through, man.

>Booker: I wish I knew more about instincts at the start. I had a p-pretty big scare early on, when I first started settling into my new body and balancing my Aura. That made my instincts start... activating, essentially. I started feeling weird desires and fears... like there was some other p-person in my head trying to take over. It kept trying to make me hate things I used to love, l-like my favorite foods or the sound of rain. It was... unsettling. But with some encouragement from Sneasel, I was able to accept those new feelings without letting them control me.

**Dog, cat, and fox mons**: Do you ever get the zoomies?

**Former humans**, Does your partner have a family? How would they respond to the question, "How's your relationship with your family?"

**Guildmons**, If your character had to trade partners with another guild members, which other partner do you think would suit them best?

**Guildmons**, You saw a job listing in the bulletin board with a huge reward, but the description is quite suspicious to say the least... would you still risk it and take the job?

**Guildmons**, An outlaw you've captured recently was accepted into the guild after he said that he was reformed (turns out to be a humon); would you accept him with open arms or would you be suspicious about his change of heart?

**Everyone**, It's a holiday! (is there such a thing in the PMD world?) How would like to spend your time in this ocassion? Would you still work and rescue Pokemon in Mystery Dungeon? Travel somewhere, err... lavish? Hang out in the guildhall all day long?

**Former humans**, Let's say PMD is an existing video game for us humons. Would you feel a bit of dread that you're in a world that's so similar to that video game? And would you tell your partner, or any native mon? Perhaps mention about it to other humons?

**Guildmons**, What's your role in the guild, if any?

**Former humans**, What's the one thing you missed the most from the human world?

**Guildmons**, Let's say a fellow guild member messed up on their mission, big time, and then the client confronts you about it. Would you tell them the truth or would you cover for them?

##->**Pair Questions**<-

**Luka & Nine**: How did you two meet?

**Cassie & Furret**: When are you and Cassie going to compete for the best fashion designer?

**Cassie & Pika**: When are you both sparking the shipping wars?

**Linoone & Debby**: Can you two lovebirds offer any relationship advice?

**Chespin & Wooper**: Have you found any material more cozy to sleep on than cotton?


##->**Lore and Misc Questions**<-

Vanon, you don't use black to outline your drawings; how do you go about choosing which shade would work best?

->I hope this makes sense to you :d <-

What continents are more frequently attacked by the blaziken raids? What do they do once they reach civilization? How succesful are they when they attack?
>The Water Continent is most frequently attacked since that's where the tribe is located, followed by the Air Continent, while the Mist continent is usually avoided. Raids are not too common although the frequency of them has increased lately. Once a raid team reaches a point of interest, they first demand all the valuables. If the population of the town/kingdom/city/etc shows any sign of resistance, then the entire place is attacked, the civilians killed, and the buildings are burned to the ground. Raids are very successful (~85%) because scouts estimate the resistance the tribe will face and raid teams are assembled accordingly. 

How common is it for your life to be at risk? Be it when venturing into a dungeon, hunting down a criminal, or just taking a stroll outside of town?
>Error: Even when I'm not trying, I find myself almost dying, but this body just doesn't give up! I just seem to walk into danger by being me... I think the Pokemon form I've been granted is more of a curse than the blessing people may see it as.

>Turk: Count how many limbs and working eyes I have, dude. I say I'm pretty high up for being at risk than most people here... And I can't help myself but keep trying to get involved in situations that are risky! Call me a thrill-seeker, bro. But seriously, Whether it's for money or helping someone out, I need to get involved in that danger sometimes. 

>Carrot & Hazel: Well, we're kinda seasoned so we're normally not in danger anymore, but sometimes thing can go wrong, but we have each other

>Booker: The overworld is safe for the most part, but it's common for me and Sneasel to put ourselves in danger, because we do a lot of missions that involve combat. It’s stressful, to be honest, but... not as scary as it could be. I trust her to fight well and keep both of us safe, and I do my best to help out too.

Before joining this clover guild thing, do you have a completely different pokemon in mind than the one you're currently using, if so, then why? For example, you were planning to be this Pokemon but it's kinda overrated/legendary/too strong and decided against it or some other member got to use it before you came, and etc.
