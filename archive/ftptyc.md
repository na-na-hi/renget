「あああああ！！」

Pekora blasted out the tweet as fast as she could hit the send button on her iPhone. It was already 13:25 which meant she was nearly half an hour late for her scheduled collab with Marine. She tumbled out of bed and crawled towards her desk, reaching back to untangle her foot caught in the mess of covers and charging cables. 

*Itai!* Pekora cursed in her half-asleep state as she smashed into a box filled with various rabbit-themed goods. *I really need to clean up this room later.* Reaching up, she dragged herself onto her computer chair.

This collab would be a second attempt at beating Minecraft Hardcore mode in one sitting, but instead of the entire Gen 3 going through it together, this time it was only Pekora and Marine. After playing through the 1 Block Challenge together they felt like they had cultivated enough Minecraft skill and teamwork to rely on each other. Pekora's oversleeping for this event wasn't a good start, and would surely erode some of that built-up trust.

Frantically, she shook her mouse to wake her PC (and herself) up, then went over a mental checklist of what she needed to do. Set the OBS scene, join the group Discord call, adjust her mic volume, launch Minecraft, start the stream…

*Brrrrowwwll*

Pekora's stomach audibly murmured. She pressed against her gaseous belly. "Ooh…" She shifted her weight to her left hip and lifted her right butt cheek off the seat, then pushed, releasing an elongated fart. Her face flushed red as she felt the warm air caress her inner thigh.

In retrospect, that 2x spicy noodle challenge was not a smart thing to schedule the evening before her collaboration stream. Pekora's gut did not respond well to spice and she was up late into the night emptying everything from her bowels. Eventually, she passed out from tiredness, but fitful sleep caused her to miss both alarms and notifications from her frantic genmate.

Now, with her natural gut bacteria oblitered like the population of a fire-bombed city, the war criminal's intestines were inflated with flatulence like fleshy balloon animals. *Brap!* another loud fart snuck out her pucker and traveled up her crack. *This isn't going to work.*

After streaming nearly every single day for years, Pekora had spent thousands of hours with a microphone recording her. And despite her lore, the bunny-girl still experiences human bodily functions, has human reaction speed, and suffers from human error. Those three things have resulted in a few too many close calls scrambling to reach the mute button in time before letting one rip out her derrière.

Pekora takes her streaming career very seriously. She's currently the number 3 female streamer in the world, aiming for the top spot. Any incidents or yabs that threaten reaching her goal must be quelled. To that end, she'll use whatever tools at her disposal to help.

Grasping down into the box next to her chair, the sleepy woman felt around searchingly. *Aha! Found it.* She clasped her fingers around a cold metallic object, smooth and cylindrical and tapered down to a rounded point on the end. Then she slid open her desk drawer. *Where is it? Gotta hurry.* She rummaged around and pulled out a small squeeze bottle of lubrication.

*I can't afford to make any more mistakes today, this will be extra insurance.* She squirted a generous amount into her hand and rolled the metallic carrot around with her fingers to evenly coat the surface.

*Better let one more out for good measure.* Pekora pressed down on the spot below her belly button and bursted a hot brap. She placed the tip of the carrot at her chocolate starfish and stirred it around for a moment. The cold metal and lube were actually a relief from the burning ring of fire the spicy noodles had wrought.

Pekora thrust the carrot inside, her sphincter widening until it reached the base. The flared end poked out between her buttocks like a rabbit tail. Content that one problem was now solved, she continued with her stream preparations and turned on the microphone.

"*Ohayō*, peko." Pekora forced out a greeting to Marine, her gravelly morning voice a sharp contrast to her usual chipper self.

"Pekora~," Marine goaded, "I was just telling the viewers that you were probably still stuck on the toilet from your spicy noodle challenge yesterday."

"*Urusai!*" a little of Pekora's normal voice squeaked through. "I was not!" she said truthfully. "Besides, even if I was, only marshmallows and cotton candy come out, peko."

Marine guffawed, and Pekora laughed along with her. She was starting to feel a bit better after the stress from her hectic awakening.

"Shall we begin, peko? First, let me explain the rules. For any new viewers, Hardcore mode means we each get only one life—if either of us lose all of our hearts and die, we can't respawn back in. And of course there's no way to pause the game, either, peko. Our goal is to reach the End and defeat the Ender Dragon. Ready to start, Marine?"

"*Shukkō~!*"

-> * * * <-

"That's it, just two more crystals, peko!" Pekora enthused. After several hours and many close calls, the pair were finally in the midst of the Ender Dragon fight.

They had split up to take out the protective crystals at the top of the pillars, weaving between Endermen and being careful not to look them in the eye lest they draw their aggression.

Pekora's stomach growled. As expected, the bloated feeling had intensified during the day, and she was looking forward to the reprieve when this was all over. She shifted in her seat to try abating the buildup.

Suddenly, to both women's surprise, a high-pitched musical *Fwee~eet!* erupted.

"What was that?!" Marine croaked. "It sounded like a flute!"

Pekora was frozen still. She also heard the note, but even with her headphones on she could tell it came from a place it shouldn't have. *But how?* She put the plug in, right? Unless… In short order, a sulfuric scent rose to her nostrils and confirmed her fear.

Pekora was a very sentimental person. Her genmates have told stories about off-collabs where Pekora showed up wearing something gifted to her by fans. Of course, most of the presents followed a theme: she had rabbit plushies, bunny pajamas, fake ears, and bright pastel blankets all throughout her room. She even had a tinwhistle shaped like… a carrot.

"What are you doing?! Move!" Marine's voice broke Pekora from her thoughts. The Endermen had closed in on her character and she was losing health fast.

*Shit, can't stop now.* Pekora poured a bucket of water at her character's feet to ward off the attackers.

In real life, Pekora's body contorted as another toot whistled out of her butt.

"Should I start calling you Polkora? What's with the grade-school instruments?" Marine called out.

"I, uh, thought I would try something new, peko," Pekora scrunched her nose trying not to inhale the smell.

The final boss was nearly defeated. Only a few more hits and it would be done. Pekora's fingers tightly gripped the mouse and keyboard. She crossed her legs, desperate to stop herself from leaking more, her sweaty thighs gliding over each other.

With the impact of a final loosed arrow, the dragon was dead. Marine cheered in jubilation, but the beast within Pekora was growing more agitated.

"This was great stream so glad you could join me Marine please look forward next collab," Pekora barreled through her formalities. The whistling could be heard in the background the whole duration.

"Wait, how are you talking at the same tim—"

"Bye bye~!" Pekora interrupted as she cut Marine's mic and transitioned to her ending screen, the whistling amplifying and peaking before also cutting out.
