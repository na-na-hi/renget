>turning on the shower, you decide a cold one would deter your exothermic lover from taking the opportunity to go for a second round
>as the rain of water washes over you, your hand goes to your shoulder, fang marks still bright red, luckily not bleeding
>as you take your short respite from Y'lthar, you run your hands over your own body, washing away the sex you two have had
>your hands going lower, you check your rear, finding it a bit looser thanks to his... intrusion
>after shampooing your hair and drying off, you exit the bathroom with naught but a towel on
>walking through the small living space, you spot your scaled companion moving in your room, his head poking around the corner as he hears your approach
>'Why hello, Anon, I've just been sorting your things into a few bags I found'
>true to his word, all of your clothes have been neatly packed into your suitcases and bags, as well as a few kitchen utensils
>'And before you ask, I found your name on your license'
>his tail swiftly brings a pile of clothes to you, your wallet and keys on top of the organised stack
>'I picked out my favorites, though honestly, you've not much variety in this wardrobe... I'll have to fix that'
>He closes the last of the bags, basically all of your clothes and amenities packed, he turns and smiles, his strong arms crossed triumphantly
>'Now, we can get the furniture later, would need more than just me to carry all that'
>Whisking up your possessions, your lover makes his way out the door and you make the first steps towards moving in with him

>the train ride went by so quickly, it almost felt like the moment you stepped on, you were off
>the naga practically dragging you along, you have to fight to keep yourself upright as he pulls you back into his quarters
>leaving you at the entrance, he slithers up to his room, likely to put your things away
>taking the opportunity, you sit down on the strange chair in the living room and turn on the TV
>some kinda documentary is playing on the health channel, about the biology of Nagas
>'The pheromones that the male naga secretes, while unnoticeable, is addictive and mind altering to the human body, surprisingly it seems more effective with same sex interactions'
>what the fuck
>was this why you felt so safe with him?
>surely not, he was so sweet, it couldn't be that
>turning your head, you see the snake towering over you, frowning
>stumbling over your words, you decide to ask him if it's true
>his tail turning off the tv, he sighs and slides up next to you
>'It's complicated... I do have feelings for you, I saw you and thought you were the cutest human I'd seen in a while, so I decided to snatch you up...'
>his imposing body shrinks away as he says those words, quickly you snatch his hand, pulling him back to you
>staring into his eyes, you cautiously ask him if your feelings are real or just something he's forced upon you with this pheromone
>'Anon... I-I don't know... it's not like I can control it or anything, I just wanted to have you'
>hesitating for a moment, you lean in and kiss the serpent, his arms hesitating before he once again embraces you, his lower half wrapping around your legs
>his tongue lovingly attends to yours, dancing together as he undoes your pants haphazardly with one arm
>your crotch grinding against his, you start to stiffen immediately, moaning as your exposed member slides against the opening of his slit
>he pulls away from the kiss to smile at you, nodding slowly he softly speaks
>'Come on boy, it'd be fun'
>with that, you free one hand to help with your endeavor, slowly guiding yourself into the slit his cocks emerge from
>pushing yourself in slowly, you feel immense pressure from the walls of his entrance, his twins slipping against you
>he lets out a moan as you thrust your full length into him
>the slickness of his cool entrance amazes you, such a tight hole, the muscles clamping down on you, you have to keep yourself from bursting right there
>after a pause, his hand grabs your chin
>'Good job boy, now I'll milk you like this'
>his powerful tail wraps around your waist, his length dragging you in and out of his achingly tight slit
>you can't help but moan, feeling both of his dicks squeezed against you in the confines of his body
>as you go to let out another, he captures your mouth with his own, kissing you once more as he squeezes down on your cock
>his strong, slow strokes agonising, he carefully stimulates you, his arms wrapping around your shoulders, he pulls away from your lips with a chuckle
>'I can tell you're aching for that release already you know, it's quite obvious given how you squirm.'
>his puppeteering of your body speeds up tenfold, roughly milking your dick with his own sex
>you can't help but burst from the overwhelming sensation of his tight confines, spilling your seed inside him
>slowly pulling you out, he admires your seed slowly seeping out of his hole, his own cocks slowly exiting with yours
>'Well now, what a lovely mess you've made'
>his sultry voice sends a shiver down your spine, his grip on you tightening
>instead of penetrating you though, he lays you down, still tightly bound by his coils
>'Of course, I'll return the favor tenfold'
>his scaled hands each grab a member, slowly stroking himself over the top of you, his cocky smile enjoying every moment
>it's almost unbearable, being so close to his hemipenes and yet unable to do a thing
>his length bearing down on you, the tightness almost suffocating as he jacks himself off above you
>ever so slowly, he lowers himself, his dicks under an inch from your open mouth, your begging going unanswered
>his hands speed up, your bindings tightening once more as he proceeds to build himself towards the climax
>without warning, he slips both tips between the lips of your open mouth and begins to fuck your throat, still sore from earlier
>the tip of his tail sneaking around, he slides it between your helpless cheeks and penetrates your rear at the same time
>the dexterous tip eagerly pushes it's way deeper, searching, before long it finds it's target, your prostate
>deftly, it pushes against it, stimulating you once more, now hard again, you're forced to endure a three pronged attack
>his hemipenes in your mouth, his tail coaxing you from the inside and his coils squeezing your dick
>unable to do anything but moan, you stare into his abdomen, his chiseled features
>slowly, the sensation of his brutal love begins to drown out anything else, you forget how you even got here
>you only know one thing
>this feeling is all you need
>it takes only a moment more for you to burst, cumming for the second time in minutes as he violates your body
>he takes notice, squeezing you in rythm with your desperate thrusts as he continues to use your mouth
>before long, he too reaches his limit, forcing both of the lengths deep into your throat, he unleashes a tsunami of seed straight into you
>with his cocks lodged so deep, you needn't even swallow as he continues to feed what feels like gallons of his virile snake jizz into your stomach
>as his orgasm tapers, he slowly pulls out, gracing your mouth with a taste before he splatters your face with white
>as you recover, he keeps his coiled grip on you tight as he lowers himself
>a clawed grip on your chin guiding you into another kiss, he moans into you, satisfied with the mess he's turned you into, he savours the moment
>as he pulls away, he licks his lips, his smirk evident as he begins to once more talk
>'You know anon, this look suits you quite well'
>his coils loosen as he chuckles, letting you go
>'How about you clean up, then we'll sort out some lunch'

>having taken your time to clean your face properly, you walk out the the smell of chicken being cooked
>waltzing into the kitchen, you spot your lover at work, pan in hand as he cooks a tender cut of breast meat
>you watch in awe as he throws a flurry of spices onto the juicy meat, before sliding it onto the plate alongside some steamed vegetables
>pulling a small saucepan from the stove with his tail, he quickly drizzles a deep brown sauce over the meal, adding some parsley for garnish, once more plating up a beautiful feast for the eyes
>'Well, let us dig in my dear'
>sliding the plate onto the table, Y'lthar smiles once more, eyeing you as you take your seat and cut into the meat
>gathering up all of the elements onto one forkful, you take a bite
>the flavour washes over you, the savory spices, the sweet sauce, the hints of tang from lemon
>you may not know all of the elements that went into this veritable masterpiece of taste, but you can tell that this isn't just natural talent for the culinary arts
>this is the work of a master
>every bite of the perfectly cooked meat is accented perfectly by the sauce and seasoning
>looking up from your meal, you see Y'lthar smiling at you once more, his plate already empty as he watches you savour his cooking
>'Now, what do you think of that meal?'
>Y'lthar asks as you take your last bite, swallowing, you ponder for a moment
>as you open your mouth, you can't hold back a slurry of compliments, praising his skills and how efficiently he's cooked such a wonderful meal
>His grin widens as he slithers over, taking your now empty plates to the dishwasher, he places the two away and turns back to you
>'Now, how about we go lie down and watch a movie? I've got work from 4 to 12 at the restaurant, but until then, we can fool around plenty.'
>walking with your partner to the lounge, he picks you up and lays down with you, spooning you with his large body as his coils wrap around the two of you
>pulling up Netflix, you opt to watch a dumb action movie called 'Sleeping with the Fishes'
>it's a documentary of 1960s new york crime families, with a focus on the aquatic families who dominated the imports industry until they were finally busted on RICO charges
>as interesting as the film is though, feeling your big cold blooded boyfriend holding you is what really captures your attention
>before long, you start to drift to sleep, the last thing you hear being a soft 'I love you' from Y'lthar's slender lips

>as you wake, you find yourself in a foreign bed, barely able to make out your dark surroundings, you find it sunk into the floor and circular in shape
>the blanket you're under clearly not fitting this odd bed, you realize that Y'lthar must've placed you here after you nodded off
>taking a deep breath confirms your suspicion, it's definitely his bed
>looking to the one source of light, you spot a digital clock, it reads 11:54pm, he aught be home soon
>casting the blanket aside, you get out of his large bed and walk slowly to the main room, finding a note
>'if you wake up hungry before I get back, I've got some snacks in the pantry, I'm bringing dinner back so don't have too many! XOXO'
>smiling, you take a seat at the table you've enjoyed your day's meals at, content with these past two days
>as you put down the note, you hear the door creaking open
>'Hey Anon, you up? I brought some pasta back from work!'
