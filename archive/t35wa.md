#Chester Chainsaw Helps (?) Some Marines!

***

Dark, stormy waves swept across the sea. The dull grey color contrasted with the pure white hull of the ship that passes through them. Marines headed through these waters; searching for a beast. Stories of a terrible monster hidden within these waters have passed through the lips of terrifed locals, and the Marines were sent to investigate.

Although mostly silent, screeching has been heard as the Marines headed toward Murder Rock, a large rock formation the nearby locals avoided.

Although unsettled, the Marines stayed steady.

"Commodore, what are your orders?"

The old man watched and waited as the waves broke against the ship, Marines aiming their guns over the horizons.

"...Look there."

As the old man pointed towards ripples in the ocean, a dark being began to rise from the water.

The Marines clenched their guns, watching in fear as more of the beast rose out from the sea. Looking like a reptile with a great black carapace, it had unblinking red eyes as it stared at the Marines. Although not much taller than the average man, it looked far more threatening than any other being the Marines have laid their eyes on.

It openend its mouth, and water poured out.

Then, it spoke.

**"DO YOU KNOW-"**
"FIRE!!"

The sound of guns and cannons rang out through the air, focused entirely on the shrouded being.

Even though many of the bullets and cannonballs met their target, they harmlessly plinked off of the imposing being.

**"...DO YOU KNOW-"**
"FIRE AGAIN!!!"

Once more, the smell of gunpowder perversed the air as the Marines fired upon their adversary. The speed at which they reloaded surpassed any they had previously done before. Despite the fear and panic, they remained focused.

Despite their resolve, the guns and cannons did no more to the being than they did the first time, not even scratching the shell.

**"O-OK, BUT DO-"**
"KILL IT!!!!"

The Marines looked over their ammo reserves, but were shocked to find that they had already ran dry. Even though it seemed like it was only a short period of time when they fired on the monster for the second volley, they truly did not realize that they were spending all of their precious time using up their ammo. As the Marines realized that their reserves were depleted, some backed away in fear from the being, stumbling against the floor and walls of the ship.

Then, the Commodore spoke up.

"Y-YOU... W-WHAT DO YOU WANT!?"

**"...DO YOU KNOW HOW TO GET TO CHAINSAW DINOSAUR ISLAND?"**

"...WHAT?"

**"C-CHAINSAW DINOSAUR ISLAND. YOU KNOW, THE ISLAND WITH CHAINSAW DINOUSAURS?"**

The being watched from the waves as the Commodore spoke with several men, before turning back to it and shouting out an answer.

"...NO, WE DON'T!"

**"OH. SORRY FOR BOTHERING YOU."**

The being began to sink, sulking back under the sea. The light from its piercing red eyes faded as it sunk into the ocean, getting dimmer and dimmer as it went further, before disappearing completely.

As the shocked and confused Marines began to regain their bearings, the ones on the floor began to stand up, and talk with the Commodore.

"C-Commodore... w-what do we do, now?"
"I... I don't know?"
"Are... are we done here?"
"I... I guess?"

The dozens of still confused Marines began to go back to their usual places, and the ship itself started to turn around, in order to head back to its base.

Just as the Marines finished turning around, however, the water began rippling in front of them once again. As the scared Marines watched the water, they noticed  beady eyes looking up at them, again. 

Beady eyes the shade of a pure white.

The beady eyes rose, and it was clear to the Marines that they were not dealing with the being from earlier.

The gigantic serpant that the eyes belonged too rose from the sea, towering over the ship.

Due to the lack of weapons, the Marines huddled against the ship, sticking out their bayonets as the serpant leaned in closer.

Suddenly, with a flash of lightning, the great serpant's head fell down back into the sea, and the rest of its body followed moments later.

Standing on the deck of the ship, the dark being from earlier crackled with electricity, and a whirring noise that was already faint got quieter than it already was.

**"I-I'M A BOUNTY HUNTER. NAME'S CHESTER CHAINSAW."**

The Commodore looked at the being in shock, terrified by its speed and power. Then, he looked in confusion, as he realized the shrouded being was apparently named Chester Chainsaw, was a Bounty Hunter, and had also saved them.

**"...UH, I SAID I WAS A BOUNTY HUNTER, A-AND I WAS IMPLYING THAT I WANTED A REWARD... B-BUT YOU TECHNICALLY DIDN'T HIRE ME... S-SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO..."

The Marines just stared. Eventually, the Commodore stepped forward.

"...What would you like?"
**"...LEMME THINK ABOUT IT..."**
"Take your time."

Chester Chainsaw turned his head, looking around at his surroundings. Eventually, he noticed a barrel.

**"...C-CAN I HAVE WHATEVER IS IN THAT BARREL?"**

The Commodore pointed to a Marine, and gestured for him to look inside the barrel.

As the Marine awkwardly walked over to the barrel, being followed by the eyes of the cybernetic being, he tripped over.

**"..."**
"..."
"..."

He stood back up, made his way to the barrel, and looked inside of it.

"I-It's filled with... oranges."
**"IS THAT YOUR GUYS'  ONLY WAY TO NOT GET SCURVY? I DON'T WANT TO TAKE IT IF IT IS."**

The Commodore tilted his head, thinking for a moment.

"No, it isn't. You can have it."
**"YOU SURE?"**
"Yes, just take it."
**"ALRIGHT."**

Chester walked over to the barrel. Despite clearly being a cybernetic being, he moved as fluidly as a real animal. When he made it to the barrel, the Marine standing next to it backed away. Chester, once again with surprising fluidity, picked up the lid and fitted in back on to the barrel. Then, a device emerged from the wrist of his left arm, and he coated the lid with a glue like substance.

**"I'M SEALING IT FOR WHEN I GO BACK INTO THE WATER."**
"I see."

Chester Chainsaw finished, and picked the barrel up.

**"HAVE A NICE DAY."**
"You, too."

Chester walked to the side of the ship with the barrel in a chainsaw-like claw, and jumped off, vanishing into the water.

The Commodore spoke up.

"Men, we're never coming back here again."

And so, the Marines went back to their base.
