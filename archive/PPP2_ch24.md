#### Numerics
>*“For every complex problem there is an answer that is clear, simple, and wrong.”* —H. L. Mencken

*"This chapter is an overview of some fundamental language and library facilities supporting numeric computation. We present the basic problems of size, precision, and truncation. The central part of the chapter is a discussion of multidimensional arrays — both C-style and an N-dimensional matrix library. We introduce random numbers as frequently needed for testing, simulation, and games. Finally, we list the standard mathematical functions and briefly introduce the basic functionality of the standard library complex numbers."*
