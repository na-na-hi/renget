#### FAQ

!!!info Q: A mod is listed as outdated. Can I still use it with the latest game version anyway?
	**A:** You will need to update some part of it to avoid issues. Compare the mod to the respective file(s) in your Elona+ folder and see what is missing, then update the mod accordingly. For example, if you want to use an outdated map file, compare it to the current map1.bmp in your graphic folder. If there is anything missing, use an image editing software to add the new things to the old map1.bmp.

!!!info Q: I like things from one mod and things from another one, but they're for the same file. Can I mix and match?
	**A:** Yes, you merely have to merge everything you want in a single file.

!!!info Q: The game started crashing after using something from this list/after I edited something/after I made something myself.
	**A:** A quick fix to any failed bitmap is to open it with paint.exe and use "save as". The new file will be elona proof.
	
!!!note Alternatively, if you have GIMP: 
	open the file > Export as...> select do not write color space... in the advanced settings tab > 24bit > save.

!!!note If on Photoshop: Save as: BMP, File format: Windows, Depth: 24 bit.
	For files other than bitmaps, ask in the thread if unsure.

!!!info Q: How do I change the game's resolution, and what's the maximum?
	**A:** Open config.txt and find the lines "windowW" and "windowH.". There is no limit to the width, and you can increase the height up to 868. In order to avoid minor graphical glitches, including the top and right edge tiles being partially hidden, as well as staying as close to a 16:9 ratio as possible, 1440(or other multiple of 48)x808 is the ideal resolution. If you want to play in fullscreen, you'll have to create a custom resolution for your graphics card, as detailed in https://i.imgur.com/AT1U25m.png.

!!!info Q: How do I change the appearance of my pet?
	**A:** [i]nteract with your pet and choose the option 'f. Shape Change'. This will allow you to choose a custom sprite from the 22nd row of your character.bmp spritesheet. Starts at Column 2 (Pic_2) and ends at Column 32 (Pic_32), for a total of 30 custom NPC images.

!!!info Q: What is the gfx customizing option and how do I use it?
	**A:** http://elona.wikia.com/wiki/Custom_NPC_sprite
	It allows for customization of sprites without having to edit character.bmp in your graphics folder, which makes your customizations much easier to carry over between game updates as well as simpler to change the appearance of individual characters. This can be used on top of an existing custom character.bmp. Merely find individual sprites on this paste, pixiv or elsewhere and follow the guide. For convenience, a spritesheet featuring ID numbers and a list with their names/roles can be found here:
	https://i.imgur.com/8Y1iI0B.jpg
	https://pastebin.com/nJT4VuvC

!!!info Q: How do I use tags to specify certain things in talk (tone) files? (i.e. Player Name, Player Nickname etc.)
	**A:** Use the following tags under a %txt to specify certain strings.
	{player}	player's name
	{aka}		player's nickname (aka)
	{nptc}		the name of the NPCs's target
	{npcc}		the name of the NPC
	{me}		"I" (Japanese)
	{you}		"you" (Japanese)
	{objective}	quest:objective
	{reward}	quest:reward
	{ref}		quest:refer
	{map}		quest:map name
	{client}	quest:client name
	{sex} 		player's gender
