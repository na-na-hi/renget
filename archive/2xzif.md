"Da-da-da-da-da~!" [***BOOM!***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfoj7t7NZkI)

Brains bursting and blood pumping, what else could a girl ask for? More of course. There was always another high to chase right around the corner. Right now that high that greeted Calliope was threading the needle through a dense pack of dead-heads while a much larger hoard shambled behind her. If one hand wasn't busy tapping away at a keyboard while she carelessly carved her way through the infested ruins things would be going smoother — they tend to when you bother coming up with a plan before throwing yourself into danger, but that just wasn't her style.

***Brum-Brum-Brum-Brum-Brum-***

Her 'keychain' (Good name innit?) roars to life as her double-barrel is slid onto her back and the freed hand caresses its ribbon. She swings her body forward and lets the weight of the instrument set the tempo as her feet move along to the rhythm of a deadly dance. The teeth saw through the pack of shamblers like butter as limbs and viscera become confetti. Being on stage was one thing, but this is when she really felt **alive**. Flesh ripping, bones cracking, and blood beneath her boots. Couldn't play these notes in a town without killing off the audience, so it was an act she could only perform for the damned.

"I've gotta play for you lovelies more often." On the other side, she comes out a bit wetter and a bit redder but unscathed. A sharp turn into an alley and a quick climb up a fire escape place her firmly out of the hoard's reach. The moaning and groaning from below sound like cries for an encore as she leans over the railing to admire the crowd she's attracted. Part of her wants to jump in headfirst, but as tempting as it was, she didn't come to a zombie-infested hellhole just to indulge her violent tendencies, surprisingly.

Calli's attention turns to the crumbling apartment behind her. The door falls off the hinges when she pushes it open to reveal an overgrown mess of a room with a roof that looks like it could collapse from a strong breeze. Rubble lands at her feet as she steps inside to look around. Being crushed to death wasn't how she wanted to go (Unless it was between the thighs of that floozy in Port Steel) but she wasn't about to leave the place untouched.

Toasters, TVs, computers, and any other decrepit tech she finds are opened up and gutted for parts. Any parts were good, but what she was really hoping for were some nice, pristine speakers. She was set on upgrading her buggy in a lovely way; kitting it out with a sound system would make spreading her tunes across the wasteland all the easier. If she wasn't that lucky? Doing a gig or two for those Razors would have it sorted. Going to them first would've made more sense, but it sure as hell wouldn't have been as fun.

"Oooh~ What'd those rotten leave for lil ole me?" Tucked behind some crap in a closet in a shiny, steel safe calling her name. Calli brings it out to get a better look, knocking on it and putting her ear to the door while spinning the dial. She didn't know the first thing about safe cracking but it would've made a good story if it just opened while she was screwing around. Once she's had enough fun, the rocker straightens out and holds her instrument by its neck. Her baby hadn't failed her yet when it came to cracking open the toughest of skulls (Muties could have some sturdy ones), and this wouldn't be any different.

The metal whines as bits flake off but eventually, the door falls away from the rest of the safe. Her heart races and she licks her lips in anticipation while bending over to get a peek at what lies inside. No one bothered locking up useless crap. Hopefully. She had no idea how people used to be so all she could hope for was that they weren't a bunch of boring assholes. If they were she probably wouldn't have just sawn open a safe, so she liked to keep an optimistic outlook.

"Wasn't spectin' this but I ain't complainin'. Oh, this is some freaky stuff alright!" Her bounty? A lot of old nudie mag, like a whole lot. Well preserved and with an excellent choice of kinks to pick from. She flips through an issue of **Mistress Magazine** and eases onto a ratty couch while ogling a spread of a chained-up redhead. She starting to feel a bit randy anyway and now was as good a time as ever to let off some steam. Unfortunately, just as she's getting into the swing of things the fast-approaching sound of boots on glass pulls her out. With one hand in her pants, Calli draws and readies her gun just as a knife grazes her cheek. A blue-eyed and dark-haired dame with her tits hanging out stares her down.

"Didn't know zombies liked to rub one out too." She smirks at Calli while twirling another knife between her fingers. Her eyes move from the gun being pointed at her to the rocker's preoccupied hand.

"*Phwwwwwhht~!* Don't mind if I write my next song 'bout ya do you? Love to do it for my better lays." Calli neither removes her hand nor lowers her gun as she eye fucks the intruder. If this was some kind of mirage or hallucination caused by toxic fumes, it was one she planned to enjoy to its fullest. "Can't do that without a name though."

"You can call your new muse Queen Bee." Bee's gaze shifts to the safe and the hefty pile of mags spilling out of it, then to the modified keytar. "And I'm guessing you're that rocker chick?"

"Fans call me Calliope. Friends n lovers use Calli. So what brings ya round here? Business, pleasure, both~?" The pair share a look as Bee sashays over and runs the cool flat of her knife across Calli's thigh and wedges it into the crotch of her shorts. The rocker coos and uses her gun to lift the cloth covering Bee's chest for a better look. "Now that's lovely."

"Pleasure **is** my business, but there's something I'm looking for. Think you could help a girl out?" Bee leans in closer while pushing the gun to the side.

"Oh, I'd lo-" Calli forces Bee's head down and raises her gun back up before letting off a shot. Blood splatters on both of them as a shambler that got a little too eager in its peeping falls dead. "Sorry bout that, sweetness. Didn't smother ya, did I?"

An affection squeeze of one of her funbags and a lick at her navel answers the question. "Discussing business." 

"Well keep at it, I like the way you talk~."

Kara glares daggers at Calliope as the rocker polishes off her plate. "What the hell are you telling me about some freak you screwed for? Forget it, just get the hell out."

"Easy now girl. I toldya I was gonna give you the highlights of my adventures. Trust me — Bee n I have had a **lot** of highlights. This one time w-" The thud of a knife being jammed into the table cuts Calli off and she throws her hand up in defeat. " I get ya, I get ya. Just thought ya might wanna know what you're missin out on."

"Well, I don't. So get out before I decide to serve smoked raider for dinner!" The glare only gets meaner and Calli decides to start making her way out.

"I guess I've teased you enough for now. Stay cute while I'm gone, ya hear?" Calli plays herself off while Kara shouts something from behind that the music drowns out. She'd be back sooner or later. A meal with such a nice view was hard to pass up but right now she had a gig she should be arriving fashionably late to.
