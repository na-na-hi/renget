    Toge might evolve in the future, but still undecided on that
    Dewott would consider evolving to get more powerful but the moment he realizes it wouldn't let him do human-style martial arts he'd trash the idea

    @toge it'd be funny if dewott evolves then realizes after the fact that he cant do martial arts anymore then has to go on a quest to get a devolve orb

    not a bad story idea but it'd literally just be ripping off chespin's idea

    wouldn't be a bad idea
    i dont mind if you steal the idea at all
