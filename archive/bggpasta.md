\>FAQ:
\>Q: Do I need to play the previous games?
\>A: No, but you should give them a try. If you don't feel like it, here's a summary of the events: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__GI7CrYnj8
\>Q: Why aren't my companion quests/romances advancing?
\>A: Companion quests and romances tend to advance during long rests. To progress them, make sure you long rest often.
\>Q: Can I recruit Minthara without going down the evil path?
\>A: If you knock her out in Act 1, yes. You do miss out on the sex scene, but otherwise the romance remains the same.
\>Q: Is Durge essentially "Tav+"?
\>A: Yes. You get additional content, BUT there are points where if you've chosen to resist the Urge and/or don't complete quests the "right" way, you'll have to pass additional checks to avoid losing companions.
\>Q: Are there any consequences to tadpolemaxing?
\>A: [spoiler]No, you can consume as many tadpoles as you want without consequence. HOWEVER, if you consume the Astral-Touched Tadpole you'll suffer some cosmetic changes.[/spoiler]
\>Q: Should I enable Karmic Dice?
\>A: Karmic Dice will avoid streaks of very low or very high rolls, both for you and the enemy. It is recommended to disable it if you're specializing.
