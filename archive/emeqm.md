>work in a genetics lab 
>esteemed in the field
>years of work paid off and got you the job at Gensyn
>it was the most prestigious company in that area and honestly a dream job
>some of the stuff they worked on bordered on science fiction
>working around the very best had you wanting to step up
>some you might have considered friends over the past year or so since you netted the job
>professor Thompson was slightly older and you'd consider him talented
>you'd grabbed beers with him
>doctor Grant was a little touchy but you respected him too
>then there were doctor Howard, doctor Fine, doctor Howard 
>you lost count of the staff that was amazing to work with 
>you had even hung out with the janitors and security of all things
>because why not get to know people
>Gensyn was intense to work under but approved of independence and creative thinking
>that attracted the driven and the… odd
>doctor Thompson was the closest thing you'd seen to a super villain 
>a stringy haired older willow of a man
>his glasses sometimes hid his eyes
>dude was obsessed
>absolutely batshit for one hyperfixation 
>sharks
>that was all he would focus on
>and to be fair sharks did merit research for disease resistance among other benefits
>Alex as he was known as slightly off but talented beyond belief
>Gensyn was a meritocracy above all else after all
>they would forgive eccentricities 
>in some ways you pitied the guy
>he was a loner after a few misguided attempts at making friends
>big "eats lunch by himself" energy 
>you were the new guy so you tried to make friends 
>it couldn't hurt
>it helped you were into the whole skinny vaguely Asian brunette thing
>probably shouldn't think of a coworker like that but you wondered what he looked like cleaned up
>the guy looked like he lived in his office
>but the way he lit up with enthusiasm when you asked about sharks was cute for an older guy
>so he was weird

>he would be a DILF
>if he wasn't single
>you made sure to ask about that during one of his shark talks
>"oh. no I don't have a wife. why do you ask?"
>you didn't have ulterior motives
>no sir
>just interested 
>he had a lanky build however the office work and what you assumed was a lack luster diet gave him a bigger butt 
>considering the rest of him was almost sticklike it stood out
>he attitude was strange
>normally dour, him lighting up when discussing his work was growing on you
>you were starting to wonder why your coworkers steered clear of him
>he wasn't the typical charismatic boisterous extrovert and capable of winning you over
>instead what got you was his genuine passion
>he cared
>maybe a little too much to be considered healthy but still
>he completely missed your flirting attempts
>really oblivious to anything not involving sharks or the sea
>however, he was the type of man you could figure out a chink in his armor easily 
>occasionally he readjusted his glasses
>like a nervous tic
>you'd remember that
>he was very confident when he spoke about his field though and that's where you'd strike
>so you asked if he'd been to the beach nearby
>he had to have
>he shook his head and was about to continue on the benefits of the hammerheads larger ampullae of Lorenzini but you stopped him
>you didn't want to shut him up but you wanted to see if he'd like to go
>maybe grab a couple beers
>he could point out fauna and everything
>his enthusiasm and passion was growing on you and all it took was a lunchtime conversation 
>so that's how Alex became your best friend at work
>you kept being amicable at the company
>just trying to be friendly
>but you did get a few gossips asking about that "weirdo"
>but this was a professional environment 
>so thankfully no one was hostile 
>just kind of viewed Alex as strange
>yeah, he was strange
>but that was fine
>the beach slowly became a weekend hang out
>Gensyn paid enough you could afford a place near the bay
>they used a smaller town as their base as a way to stay away from prying eyes
>at least that's what you were told
>no idea why but they paid well and the town was amazing
>they even seemed content with your work enough to start allowing free reign 
>at least a little
>Alex had a lot more on his plate 
>when you asked he would occasionally light up but you noticed he would be self conscious 
>like he'd hide something
>you weren't at the level to pry
>you'd gotten to know him over a few weeks
>he was still oblivious to your attraction but you were patient 
>seeing him enthusiastic about sea life at least gave you hope
>hope you could maybe get that enthusiasm directed to something else
>the idea was there but you had no way to implement it
>just had to be patient 
>the first couple of times Alex showed up to the beach in his work clothes 
>you'd have to fix that
>he didn't need to be that committed to work
>so that weekend you asked him if he had any spare outfits
>he just never saw the use in it
>you almost asked what would happen if he wanted to go out
>but you figured you were probably the most sociable he'd ever been
>so you offered him some of your clothes
>he was more of a twink but at least it would be better than his current outfits
>he brought his lab coat for God's sake
>at the very least he needed shorts
>what he didn't know was your spare clothes would be stuff you bought
>less a hand me down and more a gift
>after hanging out you'd hit a store and get him something
>your time together was relaxed though
>Alex was excitable about the sea but he wasn't obnoxious
>the clear difference between genuine enthusiasm and trying too hard
>part of you insistence on the outfit was him having no qualms about dredging the shallows in his work clothes
>at least he didn't mind getting dirty
>however, his lab coat was starting to show wear and tear from it
>his pale skin also didn't take to the sun well
>he didn't have use for sunscreen before but you'd made note of it after the first trek out to the waves
>you'd never forget the genuine look of confusion on his face when you offered to put the lotion on him
>you had clothes ready for the next encounter
>shorts and a short sleeve button shirt
>nothing too far out of the guy's wheelhouse
>you wanted to get him out of the work always mentality, not change his life like a naggy girlfriend
>you figured he looked better in blue
>you'd given him the clothes as you picked him up
>gave him a chance to change at his place
>you'd noticed he sort of didn't have a car 
>you had picked him up out of courtesy 
>he thanked you but always would say it wasn't necessary 
>but you didn't mind at all
>he even offered fuel money occasionally but he was on the way
>the hope was to get into his pants and you were going to be a gentleman about it
>besides, his company was payment enough
>that compliment fell on deaf ears because he was immersed mentally in whatever his current project was
>you had asked before if he had other friends or family he'd hung out with and he brushed the question off
>maybe you were like… it
>you wondered what would have happened if you hadn't have taken an interest
>he'd probably still be completely buried in the work 
>but now
>you had nearly forgotten
>almost as a farce you'd gotten him a big straw sun hat
>you hadn't expected him to wear it without a care
>he took to the new clothes easily
>he definitely wasn't skittish about a change like that
>slowly, you'd noticed his guard slowly let down
>at least around you
>you could coax a little more out of him
>not a whole lot but it was he definitely wasn't the quiet guy you'd seen scuttling around the labs
>you were pondering how an older guy can qualify as a twink before you pulled up to the beach
>Alex would 
>the outfit thankfully showed his legs off a little more
>not that you were trying to stare
>his skin was apparently all pale
>made sense
>so you offered sun screen
>the lanky brunette rubbed it on himself, much to your disappointment 
>at least you had the company
>he was just as unafraid of the ocean as before, immediately wading out
>occasionally you would have a fish get close and he'd handily identify it
>nothing too dangerous lived in this are, he assured you many times
>that small bit of concern was actually kind of cute
>his voice was normally calm and even
>hell, even when excited he still held himself in check
>the trips to the beach almost felt like a field trip sometimes
>you decided to surprise him this time and asked for his company for dinner
>he agreed
>you'd brought beer and snacks before on these trips
>he would also pitch in too
>but actually going out for a meal was completely new to him
>very much dinner for one at home guy
>you figured on a cheap Chinese buffet
>that got a nod of approval 
>not exactly ideal date place but you didn't want to rush things
>you weren't even sure he was gay yet
>while he didn't mention girls, that didn't mean he wasn't just oblivious 
>you just hoped you got the right vibe
>he nibbled on crab rangoon almost immediately 
>you almost wondered if his hobby went as far as his appetite as you grabbed a plate of your own
>it wasn't surprising to run into coworkers off the clock here
>some girl from accounting and her husband
>you'd forgotten her name because you rarely got to interact too much with the office wing 
>she noticed Alex quietly eating and made a snide remark about seeing him outside
>you told her that was none of her business in the most professional manner you could muster
>telling her to fuck off would have felt better but you didn't want work to get weird
>weird ass high school mentality some people kept around
>you went back and sat with you colleague
>if she'd said worse about him you may have responded worse
>but for now, you'd just eat dinner

>he looked to be enjoying himself… maybe?
>you'd known him just long enough to get some grasp on his body language 
>he was reserved enough he'd be hard to read
>maybe he'd be good at poker
>until you'd mention the ocean and his eyes got filled with an infectious wonder
>God 
>that shit was getting cuter and cuter to you
>never had you seen someone excited to talk about sea urchins 
>so you went about dinner and realized it was getting later than your usual hang outs
>Alex surprised you with a suggestion 
>instead of you making the drive back home in the dark
>"you can stay at my place tonight"
>the drive wasn't too arduous or difficult 
>however
>you weren't passing up a golden ticket when you saw it
>you just hoped this was leading where you thought
>you weren't going to push the issue, however
>if he was straight after all you didn't exactly want to hurt the guy's feelings
>judging by how he was around work you didn't expect anger if he was straight and you came onto him
>rather, he seemed like he'd get more skittish
>you seemed to be his sole social connection 
>and you didn't want to betray that trust
>it was just hard to dance around the issue
>you weren't turning down such an offer but you wanted to at least pretend not to impose
>"it was what you were wanting though, right?"
>you stopped in mid sentence to get a good look at him
>you were both standing in the restaurant parking lot and yet again you couldn't get a read on him
>you were never playing poker with this man
>had you been found out?
>"judging by your reaction, I assume so."
>ok that cat was out of the bag no thanks to your pause 
>you insisted it wasn't like that
>he brought up you asked him about his relationships but never brought up your own
>he'd even said you could probably bag one of the attractive female coworkers yet you ate lunch with him
>hung out with him
>bought him outfits and offered sunscreen
>you got into the car and pondered if you were that obvious
>you didn't think you were
>maybe not to anyone else
>but Alex here despite the social wallflower thing could read a tell
>see a pattern
>you asked if it was bad if he was right?
>"I have never had relations with anyone."
>well that didn't answer the question so you looked to him with a raised eyebrow
>"this would be acceptable"
>well it was a start
>you didn't expect him to play detective and work out all your intricate plans to get him baring his skin at the beach
>you were still reeling a little from his correct guess
>nonetheless you carried on over to his place
>the short drive let you plan a little
>you did make sure to point out you did genuinely like spending time with him
>that garnered a flash of… something behind his eyes
>then it vanished and he was Alex again
>"let's get upstairs."
>you wondered where this was going
>but hoped it was going well
>you didn't know what you expected
>but tiny studio was both surprising and unsurprising at the same time
>one tiny lamp provided all the light in the room at the moment
>it was very spartan 
>no pictures of family
>nothing superfluous 
>a very business only room
>he probably didn't spend much time here regardless
>the man was glued to the labs whenever possible
>he had a bookshelf with an antique hotplate on it
>a tiny fridge with instant ramen stacked on top like a haphazard pantry
>clothes on the floor
>one thing you noted and made sense
>a futon against the wall was the only furniture 
>of course why would he have a guest bed
>"you may use the bathroom if you wish."
>he pointed over to a dark small room
>sure enough it was a cramped bathroom
>clean though
>thank goodness he was mindful of that at least
>you were taken aback when he just started undressing in the bedroom in front of you
>you just didn't expect him to be that open
>though maybe the social norm never rubbed off on him
>he looked up at your confused stare
>"I thought this was your goal?"
>he didn't drop his usual tone
>was that his attempt at dry humor
>you couldn't tell 
>he lacked shame around you apparently 
>not like he undressed outside
>and he was right anyways
>but still
>you didn't expect him to just shrug off flirting all this time and then take off his pants of his own accord
>he stood there in the nude, not really trying to impress
>he was pretty much a twink despite the age
>he strangely seemed smooth
>whatever genetics blessed him with a lack of overwhelming body hair
>just sort of strange
>he was of course ghostly pale
>didn't seem to be wrinkled like one would expect either
>possibly another combo of blessed by genetics and he didn't seem to let stress get to him
>shadowy bags under his eyes from lack of sleep notwithstanding 
>after allowing his hair freedom he went from DILF to MILF
>except for the penis
>he was
>holy shit he was hard
>being around you made him hard?
>did you seriously have to put no work into wooing him?
>maybe you'd guessed him wrong before
>the five inches bobbing between his legs as he dug around a hamper for clean PJs told you maybe you did
>he pulled out a pair of pants… with cartoon sharks on them
>"are you getting a shower or should I be first?"
>you were surprised but Alex seemed nonplussed 
>you'd been around gay guys a lot more bashful before
>you just stood there slack jaw for a few more seconds before you came back to reality
>you asked why he was just like… that
>"what do you mean?"
>you meant how he just got naked like that
>"we are both grown men and you are attracted to me."
>but to have his hard dick out and everything
>he didn't seem to understand why you were on the backfoot so you decided to drop it for now
>he wasn't trying to show off or anything
>even with his dick out he had the casual attitude of someone waiting for a bus
>"are you not undressing as well?"
>well you got what you wanted but he definitely threw a curveball
>you mentioned you didn't have anything clean and he offered a pair of pants too
>these had hammerhead sharks on them
>sensing a theme
>so naked it was
>you just expected a little more build up
>an idea was in the back of your mind and you decided to go for it
>the old "save water by showering together" trick
>instantly shot down when he said he preferred baths
>figures 
>well you tried
>he didn't quite eye you up like you did him but he was looking
>you were hard too and made no attempt to hide it
>his eyes went to it briefly then he adjusted his glasses and looked back up
>"you look… good"
>well that was flirting
>you saw a twitch down there when he saw your dick
>so at least you and him were on the same team
>good sign
>he didn't make any more advances and you were still unsure where this was going so you weren't about to force yourself on him
>so you stepped went for the shower but forgot to close the bathroom door
>it couldn't me more obvious what your ploy was
>maybe if you put up a sign
>he didn't take the bait
>however he did give you a jump scare standing next to the curtain when you opened it
>he didn't seem phased by your reaction
>he stepped in after you stepped out
>you were going to give him privacy but he stopped you
>"you can stay and talk during my bath if you want"
>strangely intimate but you wouldn't turn it down
>it was sort of awkward at first
>you closed the lid to the toilet for a chair 
>he just soaked in the warm water 
>"you are really attracted to me?"
>it was the rather flat tone that threw you off
>you were honest
>he mulled it over
>"I have never attracted anyone before. so I have no experience here."
>well you were glad to be the first then
>he was a little rough around the edges but you weren't turning him down
>"I know such things are frowned upon with coworkers."
>you remarked you'd cross that bridge when you got to it
>plus Gensyn wanted results and they didn't care about behavior as long as it didn't interfere with those results
>whatever those would be
>"I am at a breakthrough with my research and jeopardizing it is out of the question"
>he looked to you for a response
>was this him putting his foot down?
>you wouldn't dream of messing with his work
>when you replied you'd actually do anything to help with it if he wanted
>he was always so mum about it
>that made him consider
>"that's acceptable. do you want sex tonight?"
>if you were drinking water you would have spit it out then
>was it that easy?
>was he sure?
>"you are helping me with my work so I am helping you."
>well that's an odd way of looking at it
>well you weren't arguing 
>didn't feel right jumping straight into anal sex right this instant though
>but you definitely agreed
>you decided to finally press him more on his work while he was stuck in the tub
>just between you both
>you swore 
>when you placed a hand over his sitting on the rim of the tub he looked down at it in confusion 
>he finally answered after pondering a moment
>what followed was a lecture
>he'd no doubt been filing all this information for ages and finally he got to pour his heart out to someone
>the genetic benefits of sharks
>how the things were a miracle when it came to medicine 
>how the extra sixth sense they had could benefit humanity
>even something as mundane as regenerating teeth
>the natural antifreeze and longevity in a Greenland shark
>tighter more powerful muscles
>he had a whole laundry list and there was that excited Alex again
>you let him talk and only when he finished did you push a little
>an appreciative kiss on his forehead 
>the sweat from the bath gave his skin a salty taste
>"what was that for?"
>you told him you'd never met someone with his spirit and you loved how he held a passion
>it was actually cute
>"I am a man."
>as if men can't be cute
>you loved his enthusiasm 
>and you would hope make something of this 
>your hope was he'd actually like guys
>that was a question you posed to him
>"you have me erect so I would guess"
>he showed his dick poking above the hot water
>he was still hard 
>"you still want sex?"
>you had an idea 
>and yes
>after he got out of the bath you guided him to his futon 
>he was pretty up front that his experience in sex amounted to nothing 
>this time you wouldn't rush into something rough
>you decided to start kissing
>he was awkward but reciprocated 
>tongues wrestled and he gave way easily 
>he seemed to submit 
>it was still a little strange from his inexperience 
>he was allowing you to take the lead though
>Alex didn't know what to do with his hands 
>when you broke the kiss you took the opportunity to take his glasses gently off his face
>he didn't know how to react
>when you went in for another kiss he started getting into it
>that night you ended up stripping his pants off and his first blowjob turned into an awkward 69 on the futon
>he was skinny enough you had him on top and both of you sucked until you came
>it was strange having him trying to work out how to cuddle up to you
>if you had an inkling of the trouble you'd get into you'd have thought about your promise a little
>the next month or so he invited you into his work
>there was a lot of data you didn't understand
>the applications of it were odd
>Gensyn had a few closed off areas you normally never even went through
>that's where his labs were
>you helped the best you could
>the sex was nice
>he really didn't know how to handle it sometimes but he liked it nonetheless 
>his enthusiasm was strange to get used to
>like he liked the sex but he couldn't really express it
>he wasn't rude or anything though
>your relationship had become comfortable for what it was
>at least since your feelings were out there it became easier
>one day everything changed
>you'd heard about some sort accident in the labs
>that was worrying
>when you heard whispers that Alex was involved in one way or another you were ignoring security measures 
>you ran into the closed off labs 
>security was lax because they were caught up in some kind of "containment"
>rumors had flown around
>you didn't like hearing that word
>what needed containing?
>you wanted to rush but didn't exactly know your whereabouts 
>just went deeper into the facility
>when you heard pistol fire you stopped in your tracks
>who was shooting?
>why?
>your jog turned into a slow advance 
>you figured the gunshots were an indication of "containment" 
>but you also were careful in your approach 
>the rest of the facility was trying to evacuate but you couldn't 
>just couldn't 
>you weren't leaving Alex behind
>you couldn't predict that he'd find you first
>or how

>at first you didn't recognize him
>how could you
>last you saw Alex he looked… human
>standing in front of you was a bipedal 6 and half foot tall shark twink
>shredded clothes, his lab coat barely holding together
>a few wounds on his skin
>you nearly bolted back
>then the shark tried readjusting his glasses just like Alex
>that made you pause
>then he spoke
>"I can explain"
>he was now a weird man shark hybrid and he's just treating it like you sat down for crab rangoon
>first
>why the shooting?
>what's happening?
>"Gensyn had a disagreement with the direction of my work"
>wait what was he doing
>you thought this was a genetics lab
>what happened to the medical benefits of sharks?
>"that was my goal. Gensyn wanted a weapon. so I decided to meet halfway."
>this was strange and you heard a few more sparing gunshots
>then… nothing
>"that should be that. I hope they did not go too far."
>they?
>he walked back towards the labs and you decided to follow
>you kept pestering him about questions but he was focused ahead
>the emergency had begun an hour or so before and all this seemingly happened that quickly
>"by now we should have most of the confidential parts of the facility. I am hesitant to push further but I feel security may force me."
>is that why he was wounded?
>"I was shot"
>he just says that so casually
>he straightened the tattered lab coat 
>"soon I can go back to my work."
>what was he going to accomplish now that Gensyn was hostile?
>"they do not own the building any more"
>he was so frank you had no idea how to read that
>yet you followed regardless
>probably not your wisest idea
>"Gensyn made me find a new application for my work"
>he gestured a hand out in a sweeping motion
>you noticed claws
>granted, the sleek blue and white skin was more glaring along with the shark snout and tail
>his eyes still retained human pupils
>the black shark eyes you'd seen on Discovery would have fucked with you
>teeth
>every single time he talked
>white knives clashing and fitting together
>the only real trace of his human half was his long unkempt hair
>trying to hold up glasses with no outside ears seemed to trouble him to no end
>gills along his neck gently moved when he inhaled
>this was surreal 
>yet when he got deeper in the labs you realized it was even crazier
>half beasts everywhere
>every sort of creature you could imagine
>Alex noticed your visible confusion 
>"I worked on was a DNA scrambler. when Gensyn finally went for it I just overloaded it with every piece of sampled genetic material I could get. think of it as a small bomb that does this."
>would explain why only a portion of the building was affected
>but what happened with security?
>"a few of the staff agreed with me. they did not want this used as a weapon. so we took a reasonable risk."
>this was a lot
>a gene scrambling bomb
>Alex was a shark man
>Gensyn was possibly evil
>the guy whose dick you sucked had a group of furry beastmen 
>you just wanted to make sure he wasn't hurt and you ended up tripping and stumbling into a conspiracy 
>what the hell was going on?
>how did he build a bomb that scrambled DNA? 
>"Gensyn wanted a weapon. I took the safeties off. this gave it a shotgun effect on everything and anything human."
>his pupil looked towards you and you still weren't used to this
>"I may decide to use it again if Gensyn forces the issue again"
>he readjusted his glasses
>"you will be safe. do not worry."
>he went about with fiddling over a device
>no doubt that gene bomb thing
>"after I get it operational again, do you wish to see if we can still have sex?"
>WHAT?
>"I am curious what has changed? is that a no?"
>he quietly tinkered and you had to mull over the last few minutes
>"I assume Gensyn will want their facility back. I do not intend to use this further but I will."
>after an hour of deep thought and him fiddling around he turned back to you
>it was definitely strange to see him like this
>he was still slender
>the face though
>completely strange
>a blend of human and shark meant he could still express emotion
>not that Alex did that a lot
>you noticed he had to keep holding his glasses 
>"I guess you are overwhelmed. perhaps my offer was presumptuous?"
>this was strange but you felt it best to talk about this privately
>he'd been talking about this in a crowded room of his peers and tied up security 
>good lord you just realized that
>well cat was out of the bag now
>if they didn't know you two were screwing before they knew now
>not the most important matter now anyways
>he agreed to take this elsewhere and you ushered to a janitor's closet 
>you had to wonder what Gensyn was doing but that wasn't important at the moment
>you had to ask again if he was OK
>you embraced him and he slowly reciprocated 
>you'd thought the worst when you'd heard about an incident 
>"I did not realize I might worry you. I am sorry."
>well it was the company's fault
>was this love?
>you hadn't been committed to anyone really, ever, and Alex was definitely not a fling
>when you heard about Alex you ran in regardless of danger
>maybe this was something more complex than sucking each other's dicks
>everything you'd known was tossed aside within minutes
>but Alex was still here, even if this was new
>it was hard to push into a kiss with his snout but you weren't quitting 
>you were very mindful of all the teeth
>right now you needed to clear your head and Alex had volunteered 
>sharkman or not you wanted him
>you felt his skin out of curiosity 
>despite it looking smooth from a distance, it was like sandpaper
>you weren't too rough but you could imagine the friction would hurt if you tested it
>so you'd have to feel him up slowly
>you pulled his jacket off and his shirt was quick to follow
>no nipples?
>well that was disappointing
>a couple times you'd managed to get an actual reaction out of him with those
>wait
>you looked closer and realized they were inverted now
>just blending in with his new skin
>he bucked against you when you touched one
>maybe it was optimized for swimming 
>you asked him what shark DNA he used 
>from his little lessons you guessed something like the blue shark 
>"it was a few but mostly blue shark, I believe."
>his waist and stomach were still stick thin
>you placed your hands gently on his waist and he watched you with interest
>you decided it might change things up if you framed this as research 
>when you started asking biology questions he lit up once more
>he started explaining differences 
>how he could "see" you with his eyes closed now
>how his sense of smell was heightened to the point he could smell your arousal building
>that was odd but he was cute when he got like this
>he explained that things may have changed
>you didn't understand until you pulled his ragged pants down
>this was getting out of hand
>now there were two of them
>he actually looked away from your gaze as you looked back up to meet his
>two pointed cocks leaking precum
>well this was definitely new
>you could roll with it though
>in fact, you had an idea
>your pants followed his on the floor
>you held him up by his legs and shoved your cock between his
>they at least felt slick against your own manhood
>when you asked him to wrap his hand around the trio he complied instantly 
>his new thick tail flopped a bit on the floor, a gesture you assumed signaled excitement 
>you asked him about any new findings and he remarked about finding this new sensation pleasant 
>between groans
>maybe twice the dicks meant twice the sensation 
>they'd wrapped around your own cock easily
>you had no comparison for this sensation 
>his fist pumped you both together
>he'd since dropped his glasses and you were seeing him become just a little more passionate 
>you'd touched cocks, exchanged blowjobs
>all fun
>a fact Alex had given you an idea
>he was initially confused but groaned when you bit into his shoulder
>just barely marking his tough new hide
>"sharks… bite their female while mating. you remembered"
>you fucked into his hand harder
>"you want me as your female. is that it?"
>your efforts increased as he groaned, forgetting his question
>of course you wanted to fuck him
>he was a wannabe super villain and a fish now but he was still Alex
>less wrinkles, and he tasted different 
>but it was still the same goofy guy you'd sat next to at lunch
>he'd never had a connection
>now you really wanted to seal the deal
>claim him
>this whole scenario had gone batshit and you were done thinking
>his long slender legs dangled in the air as you frotted his twin cocks, the impromptu fleshlight making for a perfect hole
>you wondered how his ass was
>the urge to just up a switch was there but you both cumming put a halt on that 
>you wearily enjoyed the afterglow, his gills working slightly against your cheek as he trembled in your arms

>"that was a rush," he confessed
>you assumed as much
>his voice was ragged and you were shocked to see him start to gasp in deep breaths 
>at first you thought Alex was just overwhelmed 
>then an idea struck when you saw a slight spark of panic in his eyes
>part shark
>of course 
>you let him down gently and ran the floor mounted mop sink in the closet 
>it wasn't ideal but you figured he'd need something
>he was showing signs of actual distress now
>playing havoc with his genetics had to have some drawback and this was it
>Alex realized what you were doing and dunked his head and neck into the sink
>he took in deep gulps of water 
>you stayed by his side and it seemed to be doing the trick 
>his breathing returned to normal and you ran your hand over his back to comfort him
>best to help him along
>after a few minutes he slowly pulled away from the sink
>"he had not exerted myself like that before. the hybrid DNA has a drawback in my case it seems."
>he leaned against you, his wet hair dripping onto your legs
>"thank you for the fast thinking."
>you were just thankful you found this out in the janitor's closet 
>the now shark man relaxed against your lap
>"thank you for helping."
>so he needed water if he was going to exert himself a lot
>noted
>you'd done the deed with a shark mutant
>that hit you 
>but it was still Alex in there
>you ran your hand through his hair 
>that part was still soft to the touch
>you were trying not to think about how you weren't wearing pants and his face was right next to your crotch 
>you weren't pushing for anything
>you didn't want to get greedy 
>instead, Alex pushed the issue
>he moved and pressed his snout towards your crotch
>you didn't jump in shock or anything
>his tongue licked up the length as he slowly tasted you
>he broke the worship to instruct you to sit in the basin
>sure it was deep enough to be waist high if you awkwardly sat in it
>but why
>you did it without pause though
>you have a feeling it had to do with the water
>your legs dangled out of it and you felt ridiculous 
>when his head vanished under the water once more you had your answer to the mystery 
>his hands on your thighs felt strange
>he wasn't completely rough on his palms thankfully
>you did have a thought though
>teeth
>you had seen those teeth
>he'd shown you enough documentaries about said teeth
>those teeth
>around your dick
>you debated whether you should allow lust to win over reason here
>he meant well
>but even before the transformation he could be a little clumsy with his blowjob
>now he had a smile full of steak knives
>would a slice make him go apeshit like a feeding frenzy?
>then his soft broad tongue worked over the shaft of your cock
>reasoning was losing
>he breathed under the water as he worked, his loose hair like a black octopus spreading tendrils everywhere
>he didn't have to do much to fit your cock in his mouth
>with his new form he could swallow you in one gulp
>you relaxed in the cool water and tried not to worry about teeth
>watching his ass casually sway with that new tail was helping
>maybe Alex would let you go all the way with him now
>that thought had all but drowned out teeth concerns
>he had an awkward time blowing you now with his new more but there was effort behind it
>his warm tongue contrasted nicely with the water
>soon you were throbbing against his licks
>when you gripped his hair you realized under the inky mop of hair, his eyes were locked up and watching you
>his tongue worked over your dick, your balls, and even the spot right below
>was he savoring you?
>his hands gripped your thighs as he felt you buck up
>your second orgasm was closer than your first and then when he started striking you with a hand you truly lost it
>a load shot deep down his throat as you groaned out his name
>all the while his eyes looked up at you
>only when you were tapped out did he pull his head up
>"I wondered if the changes affected my senses in new ways. Taste is lessened, smell heightened."
>well you guessed it was good he still wanted to play doctor
>"watching the electricity surge through you on orgasm was most satisfying however."
>that had you curious
>he caught your raised eyebrow and realized he should explain
>he recognized that look 
>"I explained before the 'sixth sense' that sharks have. how to describe it first hand eludes me at the moment."
>he sat back, lost in thought as he went over it
>"I can 'see' without my eyes. everyone is electrical pulses thanks to a nervous system. seems to have a limit in the vicinity however."
>he just gulped down your load and he was going over research 
>he sat on the floor half naked musing over things
>you'd had enough of the water and pulled yourself up
>a nearby towel wasn't in the best shape but it would do
>he had his glasses held to his head again and he was muttering over results from this latest "experiment"
>he tensed up when you used another towel to dry his hair
>so he needed water to breath when things got heated
>you stood over his as you softly dried his hair
>he mulled over the details of his new biology silently now
>you did however ask why he was just now figuring out his new body?
>you'd figured he would want to experiment right away
>"I wanted to share it with you in particular. you seemed to appreciate my work more than most. it felt right."
>was that a little confession?
>maybe the closest you'd get
>he looked at his hand in silent contemplation 
>you were satisfied he was dry but you allowed him the time to think
>"I have done irreversible damage to myself. if you want to walk away, the opportunity is there."
>your response was nonverbal
>you crouched behind him and wrapped your arms over his shoulders, clasping him into a hug
>that seemed to get through to him and he adjusted his glasses silently
>you made a note to figure out a fix for that
>"if you wish to stay we can explore further later."
>so you could possibly get laid
>at least that was something to look forward to
>"we can use the hot tub in the executive's part of the building."
>wait
>those guys gave themselves a fucking hot tub? 
>you picked Alex up by his armpits
>he was light in your hands
>that much didn't change 
>though the tail added a few pounds
>"you are more affectionate than I reasoned with the situation. I appreciate it."
>you embraced him from behind and he ceased studying himself to lean back to you
>his hand ran over your arms
>at least he was him
>you couldn't help but start kissing along his neck
>"as much as I would prefer we continue, I have work to do."
>you had to ask what needed doing?
>"I am worried about getting caught unawares"
>Gensyn?
>"among others."
>you were curious
>"if I go further, if I take all of the this to its logical conclusion, will you still be here? with me?"
>Alex avoided looking over his shoulder, focused on the ground
>you didn't quite understand what he meant by that
>but you wouldn't have left before
>there's no reason to leave now
>"I am giving you every opportunity to stay out of this and you keep wanting to stay. why?"
>you loved him
>that reply gave him pause
