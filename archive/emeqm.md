>work in a genetics lab 
>esteemed in the field
>years of work paid off and got you the job at Gensyn
>it was the most prestigious company in that area and honestly a dream job
>some of the stuff they worked on bordered on science fiction
>working around the very best had you wanting to step up
>some you might have considered friends over the past year or so since you netted the job
>professor Thompson was slightly older and you'd consider him talented
>you'd grabbed beers with him
>doctor Grant was a little touchy but you respected him too
>then there were doctor Howard, doctor Fine, doctor Howard 
>you lost count of the staff that was amazing to work with 
>you had even hung out with the janitors and security of all things
>because why not get to know people
>Gensyn was intense to work under but approved of independence and creative thinking
>that attracted the driven and the… odd
>doctor Thompson was the closest thing you'd seen to a super villain 
>a stringy haired older willow of a man
>his glasses sometimes hid his eyes
>dude was obsessed
>absolutely batshit for one hyperfixation 
>sharks
>that was all he would focus on
>and to be fair sharks did merit research for disease resistance among other benefits
>Alex as he was known as slightly off but talented beyond belief
>Gensyn was a meritocracy above all else after all
>they would forgive eccentricities 
>in some ways you pitied the guy
>he was a loner after a few misguided attempts at making friends
>big "eats lunch by himself" energy 
>you were the new guy so you tried to make friends 
>it couldn't hurt
>it helped you were into the whole skinny vaguely Asian brunette thing
>probably shouldn't think of a coworker like that but you wondered what he looked like cleaned up
>the guy looked like he lived in his office
>but the way he lit up with enthusiasm when you asked about sharks was cute for an older guy
>so he was weird

>he would be a DILF
>if he wasn't single
>you made sure to ask about that during one of his shark talks
>"oh. no I don't have a wife. why do you ask?"
>you didn't have ulterior motives
>no sir
>just interested 
>he had a lanky build however the office work and what you assumed was a lack luster diet gave him a bigger butt 
>considering the rest of him was almost sticklike it stood out
>he attitude was strange
>normally dour, him lighting up when discussing his work was growing on you
>you were starting to wonder why your coworkers steered clear of him
>he wasn't the typical charismatic boisterous extrovert and capable of winning you over
>instead what got you was his genuine passion
>he cared
>maybe a little too much to be considered healthy but still
>he completely missed your flirting attempts
>really oblivious to anything not involving sharks or the sea
>however, he was the type of man you could figure out a chink in his armor easily 
>occasionally he readjusted his glasses
>like a nervous tic
>you'd remember that
>he was very confident when he spoke about his field though and that's where you'd strike
>so you asked if he'd been to the beach nearby
>he had to have
>he shook his head and was about to continue on the benefits of the hammerheads larger ampullae of Lorenzini but you stopped him
>you didn't want to shut him up but you wanted to see if he'd like to go
>maybe grab a couple beers
>he could point out fauna and everything
>his enthusiasm and passion was growing on you and all it took was a lunchtime conversation 
>so that's how Alex became your best friend at work
>you kept being amicable at the company
>just trying to be friendly
>but you did get a few gossips asking about that "weirdo"
>but this was a professional environment 
>so thankfully no one was hostile 
>just kind of viewed Alex as strange
>yeah, he was strange
>but that was fine
>the beach slowly became a weekend hang out
>Gensyn paid enough you could afford a place near the bay
>they used a smaller town as their base as a way to stay away from prying eyes
>at least that's what you were told
>no idea why but they paid well and the town was amazing
>they even seemed content with your work enough to start allowing free reign 
>at least a little
>Alex had a lot more on his plate 
>when you asked he would occasionally light up but you noticed he would be self conscious 
>like he'd hide something
>you weren't at the level to pry
>you'd gotten to know him over a few weeks
>he was still oblivious to your attraction but you were patient 
>seeing him enthusiastic about sea life at least gave you hope
>hope you could maybe get that enthusiasm directed to something else
>the idea was there but you had no way to implement it
>just had to be patient 
>the first couple of times Alex showed up to the beach in his work clothes 
>you'd have to fix that
>he didn't need to be that committed to work
>so that weekend you asked him if he had any spare outfits
>he just never saw the use in it
>you almost asked what would happen if he wanted to go out
>but you figured you were probably the most sociable he'd ever been
>so you offered him some of your clothes
>he was more of a twink but at least it would be better than his current outfits
>he brought his lab coat for God's sake
>at the very least he needed shorts
>what he didn't know was your spare clothes would be stuff you bought
>less a hand me down and more a gift
>after hanging out you'd hit a store and get him something
>your time together was relaxed though
>Alex was excitable about the sea but he wasn't obnoxious
>the clear difference between genuine enthusiasm and trying too hard
>part of you insistence on the outfit was him having no qualms about dredging the shallows in his work clothes
>at least he didn't mind getting dirty
>however, his lab coat was starting to show wear and tear from it
>his pale skin also didn't take to the sun well
>he didn't have use for sunscreen before but you'd made note of it after the first trek out to the waves
>you'd never forget the genuine look of confusion on his face when you offered to put the lotion on him
>you had clothes ready for the next encounter
>shorts and a short sleeve button shirt
>nothing too far out of the guy's wheelhouse
>you wanted to get him out of the work always mentality, not change his life like a naggy girlfriend
>you figured he looked better in blue
>you'd given him the clothes as you picked him up
>gave him a chance to change at his place
>you'd noticed he sort of didn't have a car 
>you had picked him up out of courtesy 
>he thanked you but always would say it wasn't necessary 
>but you didn't mind at all
>he even offered fuel money occasionally but he was on the way
>the hope was to get into his pants and you were going to be a gentleman about it
>besides, his company was payment enough
>that compliment fell on deaf ears because he was immersed mentally in whatever his current project was
>you had asked before if he had other friends or family he'd hung out with and he brushed the question off
>maybe you were like… it
>you wondered what would have happened if you hadn't have taken an interest
>he'd probably still be completely buried in the work 
>but now
>you had nearly forgotten
>almost as a farce you'd gotten him a big straw sun hat
>you hadn't expected him to wear it without a care
>he took to the new clothes easily
>he definitely wasn't skittish about a change like that
>slowly, you'd noticed his guard slowly let down
>at least around you
>you could coax a little more out of him
>not a whole lot but it was he definitely wasn't the quiet guy you'd seen scuttling around the labs
>you were pondering how an older guy can qualify as a twink before you pulled up to the beach
>Alex would 
>the outfit thankfully showed his legs off a little more
>not that you were trying to stare
>his skin was apparently all pale
>made sense
>so you offered sun screen
>the lanky brunette rubbed it on himself, much to your disappointment 
>at least you had the company
>he was just as unafraid of the ocean as before, immediately wading out
>occasionally you would have a fish get close and he'd handily identify it
>nothing too dangerous lived in this are, he assured you many times
>that small bit of concern was actually kind of cute
>his voice was normally calm and even
>hell, even when excited he still held himself in check
>the trips to the beach almost felt like a field trip sometimes
>you decided to surprise him this time and asked for his company for dinner
>he agreed
>you'd brought beer and snacks before on these trips
>he would also pitch in too
>but actually going out for a meal was completely new to him
>very much dinner for one at home guy
>you figured on a cheap Chinese buffet
>that got a nod of approval 
>not exactly ideal date place but you didn't want to rush things
>you weren't even sure he was gay yet
>while he didn't mention girls, that didn't mean he wasn't just oblivious 
>you just hoped you got the right vibe
>he nibbled on crab rangoon almost immediately 
>you almost wondered if his hobby went as far as his appetite as you grabbed a plate of your own
>it wasn't surprising to run into coworkers off the clock here
>some girl from accounting and her husband
>you'd forgotten her name because you rarely got to interact too much with the office wing 
>she noticed Alex quietly eating and made a snide remark about seeing him outside
>you told her that was none of her business in the most professional manner you could muster
>telling her to fuck off would have felt better but you didn't want work to get weird
>weird ass high school mentality some people kept around
>you went back and sat with you colleague
>if she'd said worse about him you may have responded worse
>but for now, you'd just eat dinner

>he looked to be enjoying himself… maybe?
>you'd known him just long enough to get some grasp on his body language 
>he was reserved enough he'd be hard to read
>maybe he'd be good at poker
>until you'd mention the ocean and his eyes got filled with an infectious wonder
>God 
>that shit was getting cuter and cuter to you
>never had you seen someone excited to talk about sea urchins 
>so you went about dinner and realized it was getting later than your usual hang outs
>Alex surprised you with a suggestion 
>instead of you making the drive back home in the dark
>"you can stay at my place tonight"
>the drive wasn't too arduous or difficult 
>however
>you weren't passing up a golden ticket when you saw it
>you just hoped this was leading where you thought
>you weren't going to push the issue, however
>if he was straight after all you didn't exactly want to hurt the guy's feelings
>judging by how he was around work you didn't expect anger if he was straight and you came onto him
>rather, he seemed like he'd get more skittish
>you seemed to be his sole social connection 
>and you didn't want to betray that trust
>it was just hard to dance around the issue
>you weren't turning down such an offer but you wanted to at least pretend not to impose
>"it was what you were wanting though, right?"
>you stopped in mid sentence to get a good look at him
>you were both standing in the restaurant parking lot and yet again you couldn't get a read on him
>you were never playing poker with this man
>had you been found out?
>"judging by your reaction, I assume so."
>ok that cat was out of the bag no thanks to your pause 
>you insisted it wasn't like that
>he brought up you asked him about his relationships but never brought up your own
>he'd even said you could probably bag one of the attractive female coworkers yet you ate lunch with him
>hung out with him
>bought him outfits and offered sunscreen
>you got into the car and pondered if you were that obvious
>you didn't think you were
>maybe not to anyone else
>but Alex here despite the social wallflower thing could read a tell
>see a pattern
>you asked if it was bad if he was right?
>"I have never had relations with anyone."
>well that didn't answer the question so you looked to him with a raised eyebrow
>"this would be acceptable"
>well it was a start
>you didn't expect him to play detective and work out all your intricate plans to get him baring his skin at the beach
>you were still reeling a little from his correct guess
>nonetheless you carried on over to his place
>the short drive let you plan a little
>you did make sure to point out you did genuinely like spending time with him
>that garnered a flash of… something behind his eyes
>then it vanished and he was Alex again
>"let's get upstairs."
>you wondered where this was going
>but hoped it was going well
>you didn't know what you expected
>but tiny studio was both surprising and unsurprising at the same time
>one tiny lamp provided all the light in the room at the moment
>it was very spartan 
>no pictures of family
>nothing superfluous 
>a very business only room
>he probably didn't spend much time here regardless
>the man was glued to the labs whenever possible
>he had a bookshelf with an antique hotplate on it
>a tiny fridge with instant ramen stacked on top like a haphazard pantry
>clothes on the floor
>one thing you noted and made sense
>a futon against the wall was the only furniture 
>of course why would he have a guest bed
>"you may use the bathroom if you wish."
>he pointed over to a dark small room
>sure enough it was a cramped bathroom
>clean though
>thank goodness he was mindful of that at least
>you were taken aback when he just started undressing in the bedroom in front of you
>you just didn't expect him to be that open
>though maybe the social norm never rubbed off on him
>he looked up at your confused stare
>"I thought this was your goal?"
>he didn't drop his usual tone
>was that his attempt at dry humor
>you couldn't tell 
>he lacked shame around you apparently 
>not like he undressed outside
>and he was right anyways
>but still
>you didn't expect him to just shrug off flirting all this time and then take off his pants of his own accord
>he stood there in the nude, not really trying to impress
>he was pretty much a twink despite the age
>he strangely seemed smooth
>whatever genetics blessed him with a lack of overwhelming body hair
>just sort of strange
>he was of course ghostly pale
>didn't seem to be wrinkled like one would expect either
>possibly another combo of blessed by genetics and he didn't seem to let stress get to him
>shadowy bags under his eyes from lack of sleep notwithstanding 
>after allowing his hair freedom he went from DILF to MILF
>except for the penis
>he was
>holy shit he was hard
>being around you made him hard?
>did you seriously have to put no work into wooing him?
>maybe you'd guessed him wrong before
>the five inches bobbing between his legs as he dug around a hamper for clean PJs told you maybe you did
>he pulled out a pair of pants… with cartoon sharks on them
>"are you getting a shower or should I be first?"
>you were surprised but Alex seemed nonplussed 
>you'd been around gay guys a lot more bashful before
>you just stood there slack jaw for a few more seconds before you came back to reality
>you asked why he was just like… that
>"what do you mean?"
>you meant how he just got naked like that
>"we are both grown men and you are attracted to me."
>but to have his hard dick out and everything
>he didn't seem to understand why you were on the backfoot so you decided to drop it for now
>he wasn't trying to show off or anything
>even with his dick out he had the casual attitude of someone waiting for a bus
>"are you not undressing as well?"
>well you got what you wanted but he definitely threw a curveball
>you mentioned you didn't have anything clean and he offered a pair of pants too
>these had hammerhead sharks on them
>sensing a theme
>so naked it was
>you just expected a little more build up
>an idea was in the back of your mind and you decided to go for it
>the old "save water by showering together" trick
>instantly shot down when he said he preferred baths
>figures 
>well you tried
>he didn't quite eye you up like you did him but he was looking
>you were hard too and made no attempt to hide it
>his eyes went to it briefly then he adjusted his glasses and looked back up
>"you look… good"
>well that was flirting
>you saw a twitch down there when he saw your dick
>so at least you and him were on the same team
>good sign
>he didn't make any more advances and you were still unsure where this was going so you weren't about to force yourself on him
>so you stepped went for the shower but forgot to close the bathroom door
>it couldn't me more obvious what your ploy was
>maybe if you put up a sign
>he didn't take the bait
>however he did give you a jump scare standing next to the curtain when you opened it
>he didn't seem phased by your reaction
>he stepped in after you stepped out
>you were going to give him privacy but he stopped you
>"you can stay and talk during my bath if you want"
>strangely intimate but you wouldn't turn it down
>it was sort of awkward at first
>you closed the lid to the toilet for a chair 
>he just soaked in the warm water 
>"you are really attracted to me?"
>it was the rather flat tone that threw you off
>you were honest
>he mulled it over
>"I have never attracted anyone before. so I have no experience here."
>well you were glad to be the first then
>he was a little rough around the edges but you weren't turning him down
>"I know such things are frowned upon with coworkers."
>you remarked you'd cross that bridge when you got to it
>plus Gensyn wanted results and they didn't care about behavior as long as it didn't interfere with those results
>whatever those would be
>"I am at a breakthrough with my research and jeopardizing it is out of the question"
>he looked to you for a response
>was this him putting his foot down?
>you wouldn't dream of messing with his work
>when you replied you'd actually do anything to help with it if he wanted
>he was always so mum about it
>that made him consider
>"that's acceptable. do you want sex tonight?"
>if you were drinking water you would have spit it out then
>was it that easy?
>was he sure?
>"you are helping me with my work so I am helping you."
>well that's an odd way of looking at it
>well you weren't arguing 
>didn't feel right jumping straight into anal sex right this instant though
>but you definitely agreed
>you decided to finally press him more on his work while he was stuck in the tub
>just between you both
>you swore 
>when you placed a hand over his sitting on the rim of the tub he looked down at it in confusion 
>he finally answered after pondering a moment
>what followed was a lecture
>he'd no doubt been filing all this information for ages and finally he got to pour his heart out to someone
>the genetic benefits of sharks
>how the things were a miracle when it came to medicine 
>how the extra sixth sense they had could benefit humanity
>even something as mundane as regenerating teeth
>the natural antifreeze and longevity in a Greenland shark
>tighter more powerful muscles
>he had a whole laundry list and there was that excited Alex again
>you let him talk and only when he finished did you push a little
>an appreciative kiss on his forehead 
>the sweat from the bath gave his skin a salty taste
>"what was that for?"
>you told him you'd never met someone with his spirit and you loved how he held a passion
>it was actually cute
>"I am a man."
>as if men can't be cute
>you loved his enthusiasm 
>and you would hope make something of this 
>your hope was he'd actually like guys
>that was a question you posed to him
>"you have me erect so I would guess"
>he showed his dick poking above the hot water
>he was still hard 
>"you still want sex?"
>you had an idea 
>and yes
>after he got out of the bath you guided him to his futon 
>he was pretty up front that his experience in sex amounted to nothing 
>this time you wouldn't rush into something rough
>you decided to start kissing
>he was awkward but reciprocated 
>tongues wrestled and he gave way easily 
>he seemed to submit 
>it was still a little strange from his inexperience 
>he was allowing you to take the lead though
>Alex didn't know what to do with his hands 
>when you broke the kiss you took the opportunity to take his glasses gently off his face
>he didn't know how to react
>when you went in for another kiss he started getting into it
>that night you ended up stripping his pants off and his first blowjob turned into an awkward 69 on the futon
>he was skinny enough you had him on top and both of you sucked until you came
>it was strange having him trying to work out how to cuddle up to you
>if you had an inkling of the trouble you'd get into you'd have thought about your promise a little
>the next month or so he invited you into his work
>there was a lot of data you didn't understand
>the applications of it were odd
>Gensyn had a few closed off areas you normally never even went through
>that's where his labs were
>you helped the best you could
>the sex was nice
>he really didn't know how to handle it sometimes but he liked it nonetheless 
>his enthusiasm was strange to get used to
>like he liked the sex but he couldn't really express it
>he wasn't rude or anything though
>your relationship had become comfortable for what it was
>at least since your feelings were out there it became easier
>one day everything changed
>you'd heard about some sort accident in the labs
>that was worrying
>when you heard whispers that Alex was involved in one way or another you were ignoring security measures 
>you ran into the closed off labs 
>security was lax because they were caught up in some kind of "containment"
>rumors had flown around
>you didn't like hearing that word
>what needed containing?
>you wanted to rush but didn't exactly know your whereabouts 
>just went deeper into the facility
>when you heard pistol fire you stopped in your tracks
>who was shooting?
>why?
>your jog turned into a slow advance 
>you figured the gunshots were an indication of "containment" 
>but you also were careful in your approach 
>the rest of the facility was trying to evacuate but you couldn't 
>just couldn't 
>you weren't leaving Alex behind
>you couldn't predict that he'd find you first
>or how
