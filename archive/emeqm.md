>work in a genetics lab 
>esteemed in the field
>years of work paid off and got you the job at Gensyn
>it was the most prestigious company in that area and honestly a dream job
>some of the stuff they worked on bordered on science fiction
>working around the very best had you wanting to step up
>some you might have considered friends over the past year or so since you netted the job
>professor Thompson was slightly older and you'd consider him talented
>you'd grabbed beers with him
>doctor Grant was a little touchy but you respected him too
>then there were doctor Howard, doctor Fine, doctor Howard 
>you lost count of the staff that was amazing to work with 
>you had even hung out with the janitors and security of all things
>because why not get to know people
>Gensyn was intense to work under but approved of independence and creative thinking
>that attracted the driven and the… odd
>doctor Thompson was the closest thing you'd seen to a super villain 
>a stringy haired older willow of a man
>his glasses sometimes hid his eyes
>dude was obsessed
>absolutely batshit for one hyperfixation 
>sharks
>that was all he would focus on
>and to be fair sharks did merit research for disease resistance among other benefits
>Alex as he was known as slightly off but talented beyond belief
>Gensyn was a meritocracy above all else after all
>they would forgive eccentricities 
>in some ways you pitied the guy
>he was a loner after a few misguided attempts at making friends
>big "eats lunch by himself" energy 
>you were the new guy so you tried to make friends 
>it couldn't hurt
>it helped you were into the whole skinny vaguely Asian brunette thing
>probably shouldn't think of a coworker like that but you wondered what he looked like cleaned up
>the guy looked like he lived in his office
>but the way he lit up with enthusiasm when you asked about sharks was cute for an older guy
>so he was weird

>he would be a DILF
>if he wasn't single
>you made sure to ask about that during one of his shark talks
>"oh. no I don't have a wife. why do you ask?"
>you didn't have ulterior motives
>no sir
>just interested 
>he had a lanky build however the office work and what you assumed was a lack luster diet gave him a bigger butt 
>considering the rest of him was almost sticklike it stood out
>he attitude was strange
>normally dour, him lighting up when discussing his work was growing on you
>you were starting to wonder why your coworkers steered clear of him
>he wasn't the typical charismatic boisterous extrovert and capable of winning you over
>instead what got you was his genuine passion
>he cared
>maybe a little too much to be considered healthy but still
>he completely missed your flirting attempts
>really oblivious to anything not involving sharks or the sea
>however, he was the type of man you could figure out a chink in his armor easily 
>occasionally he readjusted his glasses
>like a nervous tic
>you'd remember that
>he was very confident when he spoke about his field though and that's where you'd strike
>so you asked if he'd been to the beach nearby
>he had to have
>he shook his head and was about to continue on the benefits of the hammerheads larger ampullae of Lorenzini but you stopped him
>you didn't want to shut him up but you wanted to see if he'd like to go
>maybe grab a couple beers
>he could point out fauna and everything
>his enthusiasm and passion was growing on you and all it took was a lunchtime conversation 
>so that's how Alex became your best friend at work
>you kept being amicable at the company
>just trying to be friendly
>but you did get a few gossips asking about that "weirdo"
>but this was a professional environment 
>so thankfully no one was hostile 
>just kind of viewed Alex as strange
>yeah, he was strange
>but that was fine
>the beach slowly became a weekend hang out
>Gensyn paid enough you could afford a place near the bay
>they used a smaller town as their base as a way to stay away from prying eyes
>at least that's what you were told
>no idea why but they paid well and the town was amazing
>they even seemed content with your work enough to start allowing free reign 
>at least a little
>Alex had a lot more on his plate 
>when you asked he would occasionally light up but you noticed he would be self conscious 
>like he'd hide something
>you weren't at the level to pry
>you'd gotten to know him over a few weeks
>he was still oblivious to your attraction but you were patient 
>seeing him enthusiastic about sea life at least gave you hope
>hope you could maybe get that enthusiasm directed to something else
>the idea was there but you had no way to implement it
>just had to be patient 
>the first couple of times Alex showed up to the beach in his work clothes 
>you'd have to fix that
>he didn't need to be that committed to work
>so that weekend you asked him if he had any spare outfits
>he just never saw the use in it
>you almost asked what would happen if he wanted to go out
>but you figured you were probably the most sociable he'd ever been
>so you offered him some of your clothes
>he was more of a twink but at least it would be better than his current outfits
>he brought his lab coat for God's sake
>at the very least he needed shorts
>what he didn't know was your spare clothes would be stuff you bought
>less a hand me down and more a gift
>after hanging out you'd hit a store and get him something
>your time together was relaxed though
>Alex was excitable about the sea but he wasn't obnoxious
>the clear difference between genuine enthusiasm and trying too hard
>part of you insistence on the outfit was him having no qualms about dredging the shallows in his work clothes
>at least he didn't mind getting dirty
>however, his lab coat was starting to show wear and tear from it
>his pale skin also didn't take to the sun well
>he didn't have use for sunscreen before but you'd made note of it after the first trek out to the waves
>you'd never forget the genuine look of confusion on his face when you offered to put the lotion on him
>you had clothes ready for the next encounter
>shorts and a short sleeve button shirt
>nothing too far out of the guy's wheelhouse
>you wanted to get him out of the work always mentality, not change his life like a naggy girlfriend
>you figured he looked better in blue
>you'd given him the clothes as you picked him up
>gave him a chance to change at his place
>you'd noticed he sort of didn't have a car 
>you had picked him up out of courtesy 
>he thanked you but always would say it wasn't necessary 
>but you didn't mind at all
>he even offered fuel money occasionally but he was on the way
>the hope was to get into his pants and you were going to be a gentleman about it
>besides, his company was payment enough
>that compliment fell on deaf ears because he was immersed mentally in whatever his current project was
>you had asked before if he had other friends or family he'd hung out with and he brushed the question off
>maybe you were like… it
>you wondered what would have happened if you hadn't have taken an interest
>he'd probably still be completely buried in the work 
>but now
>you had nearly forgotten
>almost as a farce you'd gotten him a big straw sun hat
>you hadn't expected him to wear it without a care
>he took to the new clothes easily
>he definitely wasn't skittish about a change like that
>slowly, you'd noticed his guard slowly let down
>at least around you
>you could coax a little more out of him
>not a whole lot but it was he definitely wasn't the quiet guy you'd seen scuttling around the labs
>you were pondering how an older guy can qualify as a twink before you pulled up to the beach
>Alex would 
>the outfit thankfully showed his legs off a little more
>not that you were trying to stare
>his skin was apparently all pale
>made sense
>so you offered sun screen
>the lanky brunette rubbed it on himself, much to your disappointment 
>at least you had the company
>he was just as unafraid of the ocean as before, immediately wading out
>occasionally you would have a fish get close and he'd handily identify it
>nothing too dangerous lived in this are, he assured you many times
>that small bit of concern was actually kind of cute
>his voice was normally calm and even
>hell, even when excited he still held himself in check
>the trips to the beach almost felt like a field trip sometimes
>you decided to surprise him this time and asked for his company for dinner
>he agreed
>you'd brought beer and snacks before on these trips
>he would also pitch in too
>but actually going out for a meal was completely new to him
>very much dinner for one at home guy
>you figured on a cheap Chinese buffet
>that got a nod of approval 
>not exactly ideal date place but you didn't want to rush things
>you weren't even sure he was gay yet
>while he didn't mention girls, that didn't mean he wasn't just oblivious 
>you just hoped you got the right vibe
>he nibbled on crab rangoon almost immediately 
>you almost wondered if his hobby went as far as his appetite as you grabbed a plate of your own
>it wasn't surprising to run into coworkers off the clock here
>some girl from accounting and her husband
>you'd forgotten her name because you rarely got to interact too much with the office wing 
>she noticed Alex quietly eating and made a snide remark about seeing him outside
>you told her that was none of her business in the most professional manner you could muster
>telling her to fuck off would have felt better but you didn't want work to get weird
>weird ass high school mentality some people kept around
>you went back and sat with you colleague
>if she'd said worse about him you may have responded worse
>but for now, you'd just eat dinner
