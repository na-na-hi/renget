### Seer ♀
As an egotistical, aspiring witch, Seer found herself surpassing expectations from a young age, becoming a gifted mage, a skilled tactician, and an excellent leader. Or at least, that's what she thinks. Seeking greater triumphs in the field of magecraft, she left home in search of greatness. Seer could care less about being the leader of Team Wonder; her team doesn't have anything to do with magic, so she doesn't bother worrying about it, but knows that her allies are worth sticking close to. As the leader of the bunch, it may seem likely that she'd be the one in charge, but in reality, she only took up the spot because Dot was too self-conscious to accept the position. She tells Dot to lead the team, he does it, and she's fine with her place. In battle, she wields powerful yet inconsistent magics, but packs a punch when they work as anticipated.
