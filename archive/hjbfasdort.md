>Leona POV

>it was a friday night
>a time where you and Anon can finally relax 
>by relax you mean having bed breaking sex
>you pin his arms at the head of the bed with unforeseen strength
"D-Don't you think we should have some foreplay first?"
>cute, he thinks he can give orders to you
>"Aw don't you worry about that my little prey~"
>with quick movement you tear off his clothes, exposing his bare chest
>he hissed as he felt your claws cut at his skin
>another mark to signify your relationship
>your hands travel to each scar all over his chest, making sure to caress them to see every little reaction he makes
>until you reach the hem of his pants and pull it down
>despite his weak protests, he was hard
>"See? Even your little friend wants it now."
>his groans were delicious as you gripped his dick hard and pumped it up and down
"Oh God Leona."
>you stop jacking him off and pinched his base
>"Ah ah ah, did you forget who you are talking to now?"
>Anon bit his lip and nodded
"M-Mistress..."
>"Good Boy,"
>you didn't waste time aligning his dick on your dripping wet pussy
>the anticipation was killing him and he tried to reach for your body
>but your hand pinned both of his arms above his head
>"No touching until you are allowed to."
>he shifted uncomfortably as you teased him with your lower lips
"Please. Please Please."
>"Please what?"
"I want you to."
>you sadistically gyrate your hips just out of reach from his tip
>"Want to what? Speak up prey~"
"I-I want you to fuck me-"
>shut him up with a slap of your hips down to his base
>he gasped at the sudden weight of your body crushing his poor pelvis
>you hold off a moan as his cock rubbed your insides right
>"Now for the main course."
>raising your hips until he was barely inside, you drop down again
>getting into a rhythm, your free hand gripped his shoulder, letting your claws dig into his skin again
>Anon continued his noises of pleasure as he shook under your weight
>however, you suddenly feel his orgasm seep in to your womb as he quivers in delight
>you stop bouncing on his dick and look at him with anger 
>"You didn't warn me you little shit."
>you grip on his arms tighter 
"I'm sorry mistress!"
>your hand grabs his chin roughly and force him to look at you
>"Prey like you deserve punishment."
>he was scared at your eyes boring into his own
>fuck he always looks cute
>"But that comes later."
>you let go of his chin and continue to bounced on his cock
"Ah! Mistress too- sensitive!"
>"Well tough shit, I didn't get to cum and you have to deal with the consequences."
>his legs spasmed from torturous pleasure as you continue to ride your personal dildo
>your hand naturally grasps his neck, laid with scars previous encounters, as his eyes rolled up in pleasure
>his cock eventually hardened inside your womb and you mounted on his cock faster
>the sounds of his moans filled the dark room while you looked down as he drowned in euphoria
>claws pushed into his skin as he choked out 'mistresses' and begging words
>"Mmmf god I love this~"
>you finally let go of his arms and joined in with the other
>his body responded to the sensation of your chokehold with another twitch
>"Haah... You like it when I do this huh?"
>Anon could only look at you, his eyes only staring at your own as his face was flushed red
>you gripped his neck harder, as his hips thrusted up to meet your own
>"C'mon my little prey, don't you wanna cum with your mistress?"
>his hands latched on to your own as he feebly tried to push you away
>"C'mon..."
>you close your eyes as you anticipated for your own orgasm to  reach its peak
>"Give it to me bitch."
>his legs kick behind you as you squeezed harder, his sounds accompanying your movements
>"FUCK~!"
>your spine sent shock waves down to your body as your pussy gripped his cock tight
>letting your juices flood down to his member as your hips plant firmly on to his probably bruised pelvis
>you open your eyes up towards the ceiling and look down
>Anon's eyes were closed and he wasn't moving
>must be from how you choked him out
>"Aww my little prey is all tuckered out~"
>well you know how to fix that
>you nudge him awake but he was st ill out cold
>a hard slap to his face usually woke him up hard 
>but he still wasn't moving
>you were a bit pissed, he usually handled worse from you
>"C'mon, your mistress isn't done with you yet."
>you tried shaking his entire body, it limped as you continued to slap him awake
>"Okay Anon, I get it, your tired. You should at least eat me out considering you came first."
>still no response
>trying to jolt him up with a little cut on his red chest didn't even work
>"T-This isn't funny Anon. Wake up!"

>Jane POV
>you yawn as another late night shift in your cramped police cruiser
>still not all bad
>you got a cute humie recruit, Roger (heh), keeping you company
>he's bit jittery but, endearing
>"So kid, any hobbies."
>he looked up from his light sleep
>"None than that I could think of."
>you playfully nudge against his shoulder
>"Ah don't be a sourpuss. I don't bite, unless you want to. But I'm genuinely curious."
>he shuffled uncomfortably from his seat until he said
>"Well, I usually-"
>"Attention, we got a noise complaint on House number XX, XXXXX Ave., all nearby officers please respond."
>you roll your eyes at the cock blocker and grab the radio
>"10-4, we're on our way."
>you shift the gear and drive to the address 
>"Well rookie, looks like it's gonna be an interesting night yet. 
>entering the street, you look to find the 1 story house 
>you two exit the car and approach the front door
>strange thing was that it was dead silent
>knocking on the door, you get no response
>you huff in annoyance and was about to knock but then something kicks you into overdrive
>the smell of blood
>your hair stand up on their ends as you ready your firearm
>"Get ready kid, we're going in."
>"W-Wait don't we need a warrant to search?"
>you bust down the door and the smell gets stronger
>"Nut up or shut up rookie, something's wrong and I'm going in."
>the two of you searched every room, making sure you go first before him
>every room was clear except one
>the smell behind the unchecked door was the strongest
>you take a deep breath and kick it down
>"Police! Hands in the air!"
>you weren't expecting the sight before you
>a lioness mounted on a bloodied human as she shook his limp body
>she screamed and raised her arm with her claws out
>without thinking, you rushed and tackled the anthro, catching some of her claws in the process
>you try to pin her down but her hysteric screaming and thrashing kept you occupied
>"Roger! Check the victim to see if he's still alive!"
>using your brute strength, you finally pin the lioness' arms down and cuff them to the nearest bed leg
>"Ahhhhua! Aaaah!!!"
>the anthro was screaming and crying, dragging away from her bindings to go towards the human
>"D-Dispatch! we have a 123 and a suspect in custody here. Requesting backup over!"
>"Copy that, sending immediate medical assistance and officers to your location."
>you left the crazy lady from her position and watched as Roger tried to administer first aid
>"What's the situation?"
>"He's bleeding terribly from the neck. Here, give him some pressure on this spot."
>it was unusual taking orders from a human, but you nonetheless help him try to keep the victim alive
>you could see the poor sod's eyes fading from this world
>looking back, you see the lioness wasn't moving from her position, just sobbing quietly
>Roger eventually bandaged his neck 
>"He'll need an ambulance considering the damage."
>you grit your teeth on how something like this could happen
>"J-Jane your arm!"
>you notice the deep gashes on your arms and torn uniform and chuckle
>"I'll live kid, though I don't think I could say the same to loverboy here."
>your attempt to alleviate the tension went over Roger's head as he looked at you with disgust on his face
> your joke might've went too far much to your chagrin
>eventually backup does arrive, with the human already being rolled in to an ambulance
>the lioness meanwhile was cuffed and taken to your station wagon to be jailed
>giving her a hard look was enough to keep her head down
>you give yourself a quiet time to think as you try to take in what happened in that room
