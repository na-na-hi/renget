>Leona POV

>it was a friday night
>a time where you and Anon can finally relax 
>by relax you mean having bed breaking sex
>you pin his arms at the head of the bed with unforeseen strength
"D-Don't you think we should have some foreplay first?"
>cute, he thinks he can give orders to you
>"Aw don't you worry about that my little prey~"
>with quick movement you tear off his clothes, exposing his bare chest
>he hissed as he felt your claws cut at his skin
>another mark to signify your relationship
>your hands travel to each scar all over his chest, making sure to caress them to see every little reaction he makes
>until you reach the hem of his pants and pull it down
>despite his weak protests, he was hard
>"See? Even your little friend wants it now."
>his groans were delicious as you gripped his dick hard and pumped it up and down
"Oh God Leona."
>you stop jacking him off and pinched his base
>"Ah ah ah, did you forget who you are talking to now?"
>Anon bit his lip and nodded
"M-Mistress..."
>"Good Boy,"
>you didn't waste time aligning his dick on your dripping wet pussy
>the anticipation was killing him and he tried to reach for your body
>but your hand pinned both of his arms above his head
>"No touching until you are allowed to."
>he shifted uncomfortably as you teased him with your lower lips
"Please. Please Please."
>"Please what?"
"I want you to."
>you sadistically gyrate your hips just out of reach from his tip
>"Want to what? Speak up prey~"
"I-I want you to fuck me-"
>shut him up with a slap of your hips down to his base
>he gasped at the sudden weight of your body crushing his poor pelvis
>you hold off a moan as his cock rubbed your insides right
>"Now for the main course."
>raising your hips until he was barely inside, you drop down again
>getting into a rhythm, your free hand gripped his shoulder, letting your claws dig into his skin again
>Anon continued his noises of pleasure as he shook under your weight
>however, you suddenly feel his orgasm seep in to your womb as he quivers in delight
>you stop bouncing on his dick and look at him with anger 
>"You didn't warn me you little shit."
>you grip on his arms tighter 
"I'm sorry mistress!"
>your hand grabs his chin roughly and force him to look at you
>"Prey like you deserve punishment."
>he was scared at your eyes boring into his own
>fuck he always looks cute
>"But that comes later."
>you let go of his chin and continue to bounced on his cock
"Ah! Mistress too- sensitive!"
>"Well tough shit, I didn't get to cum and you have to deal with the consequences."
>his legs spasmed from torturous pleasure as you continue to ride your personal dildo
>your hand naturally grasps his neck, laid with scars previous encounters, as his eyes rolled up in pleasure
>his cock eventually hardened inside your womb and you mounted on his cock faster
>the sounds of his moans filled the dark room while you looked down as he drowned in euphoria
>claws pushed into his skin as he choked out 'mistresses' and begging words
>"Mmmf god I love this~"
>you finally let go of his arms and joined in with the other
>his body responded to the sensation of your chokehold with another twitch
>"Haah... You like it when I do this huh?"
>Anon could only look at you, his eyes only staring at your own as his face was flushed red
>you gripped his neck harder, as his hips thrusted up to meet your own
>"C'mon my little prey, don't you wanna cum with your mistress?"
>his hands latched on to your own as he feebly tried to push you away
>"C'mon..."
>you close your eyes as you anticipated for your own orgasm to  reach its peak
>"Give it to me bitch."
>his legs kick behind you as you squeezed harder, his sounds accompanying your movements
>"FUCK~!"
>your spine sent shock waves down to your body as your pussy gripped his cock tight
>letting your juices flood down to his member as your hips plant firmly on to his probably bruised pelvis
>you open your eyes up towards the ceiling and look down
>Anon's eyes were closed and he wasn't moving
>must be from how you choked him out
>"Aww my little prey is all tuckered out~"
>well you know how to fix that
>you nudge him awake but he was st ill out cold
>a hard slap to his face usually woke him up hard 
>but he still wasn't moving
>you were a bit pissed, he usually handled worse from you
>"C'mon, your mistress isn't done with you yet."
>you tried shaking his entire body, it limped as you continued to slap him awake
>"Okay Anon, I get it, your tired. You should at least eat me out considering you came first."
>still no response
>trying to jolt him up with a little cut on his red chest didn't even work
>"T-This isn't funny Anon. Wake up!"

>Jane POV
>you yawn as another late night shift in your cramped police cruiser
>still not all bad
>you got a cute humie recruit, Roger (heh), keeping you company
>he's bit jittery but, endearing
>"So kid, any hobbies."
>he looked up from his light sleep
>"None than that I could think of."
>you playfully nudge against his shoulder
>"Ah don't be a sourpuss. I don't bite, unless you want to. But I'm genuinely curious."
>he shuffled uncomfortably from his seat until he said
>"Well, I usually-"
>"Attention, we got a noise complaint on House number XX, XXXXX Ave., all nearby officers please respond."
>you roll your eyes at the cock blocker and grab the radio
>"10-4, we're on our way."
>you shift the gear and drive to the address 
>"Well rookie, looks like it's gonna be an interesting night yet. 
>entering the street, you look to find the 1 story house 
>you two exit the car and approach the front door
>strange thing was that it was dead silent
>knocking on the door, you get no response
>you huff in annoyance and was about to knock but then something kicks you into overdrive
>the smell of blood
>your hair stand up on their ends as you ready your firearm
>"Get ready kid, we're going in."
>"W-Wait don't we need a warrant to search?"
>you bust down the door and the smell gets stronger
>"Nut up or shut up rookie, something's wrong and I'm going in."
>the two of you searched every room, making sure you go first before him
>every room was clear except one
>the smell behind the unchecked door was the strongest
>you take a deep breath and kick it down
>"Police! Hands in the air!"
>you weren't expecting the sight before you
>a lioness mounted on a bloodied human as she shook his limp body
>she screamed and raised her arm with her claws out
>without thinking, you rushed and tackled the anthro, catching some of her claws in the process
>you try to pin her down but her hysteric screaming and thrashing kept you occupied
>"Roger! Check the victim to see if he's still alive!"
>using your brute strength, you finally pin the lioness' arms down and cuff them to the nearest bed leg
>"Ahhhhua! Aaaah!!!"
>the anthro was screaming and crying, dragging away from her bindings to go towards the human
>"D-Dispatch! we have a 123 and a suspect in custody here. Requesting backup over!"
>"Copy that, sending immediate medical assistance and officers to your location."
>you left the crazy lady from her position and watched as Roger tried to administer first aid
>"What's the situation?"
>"He's bleeding terribly from the neck. Here, give him some pressure on this spot."
>it was unusual taking orders from a human, but you nonetheless help him try to keep the victim alive
>you could see the poor sod's eyes fading from this world
>looking back, you see the lioness wasn't moving from her position, just sobbing quietly
>Roger eventually bandaged his neck 
>"He'll need an ambulance considering the damage."
>you grit your teeth on how something like this could happen
>"J-Jane your arm!"
>you notice the deep gashes on your arms and torn uniform and chuckle
>"I'll live kid, though I don't think I could say the same to loverboy here."
>your attempt to alleviate the tension went over Roger's head as he looked at you with disgust on his face
> your joke might've went too far much to your chagrin
>eventually backup does arrive, with the human already being rolled in to an ambulance
>the lioness meanwhile was cuffed and taken to your station wagon to be jailed
>giving her a hard look was enough to keep her head down
>you give yourself a quiet time to think as you try to take in what happened in that room

>Augustine POV

>be detective doberman
>currently overseeing the investigation of Anon Y. Mous' death
>your fellow officers snapped pictures of the crime scene
>the bedroom was a mess, consisting of scratched up pillows, thrown blankets, and blood
>lots and lots of blood
>you bit your tongue at how long the poor guy was alive before he bled out
>seeing the evidence and the testimony given by the two officers, it was an open and shut case in your eyes
>though the charge would be left to the one prosecuting this case
>"August, we found something!"
>you turn to a weasel wearing a smaller version of your uniform, holding up a worn out book with a plastic glove
>"What did you find?"
>"It's the victim's diary, or journal if you prefer. He wrote down the events of days leading up to his death."
>"Really now?"
>both of you skim the diary, talking about himself, describing his days, and even writing about his girlfriend, Leona.
>"Heh, the prosecutor is gonna have a field day with this."
>though as you turn to each page slowly, you start to take in more and more disturbing information about the couple
>even Leela, the weasel, looked appalled at what she was seeing.
>'Leona talked introducing me to her friends. I had to tell her I was gonna visit my family but she strong armed me-'
>'-even when I told her that my body was still aching from our last session she strapped me to my bed and used a paddle to-
>'-just learned that she was peeping into my call history, I tried to talk to her about it but she dismissed it saying it wasn't her but-
>'-my back aches just from the wounds, I tried sneaking away to go to a hospital but she cornered me. She laid me on my stomach and poured alcohol-
>close the book and take a deep breath
>you and Leela looked at each other before you shake your head trying to brush off the emotions welling up
>though the rookie tried to put up a brave face, you could tell the gears in her head were turning trying to process on what she just read
>you put a hand on her shoulder 
>"Look kid, this type of work ain't easy. But don't forget it's what we signed up for."
>Leela looks at you with newfound determination and nodded
>you take a ziploc bag and put the journal inside 
>walking outside while pulling away the police tape, you pull out a cigarette to smoke
>looking towards the general direction of your home and take a big puff

>Jane POV
>"So how long is she gonna be in here captain?"
>your question doesn't faze the direwolf as she continues on to her paperwork
>"Look I'm not comfortable letting someone like her staying here since most of the gals are getting antsy-"
>"What is this about Officer Jane?"
>your hardass of a boss finally looked up with her half-moon glasses perched on her snout
>"Y-You know what I'm talking about Captain, the recent arrest we had yesterday."
>"And?"
>"I'm just worried."
>"About Roger?"
>your arm ached under its bandaged state and you nodded 
>"Officer Jane, I already have two officers guarding our only criminal in jail, I don't think she'll be going away any time soon."
>Captain Glyn put her hands together
>"I'm surprised now is the time you actually worry about your fellow officers."
>you take a seat in front of her desk and looked away
>"I don't know. It's just, in this neighborhood I only had to deal with thieves, teenagers, angry folk but murder is a bit too far for me."
>"Yet you were willing to stop one last night and saved the victim."
>"Nearly saved."
>those last words was out of your mouth before you could take it back
>Glyn fixed her reading glasses and continued
>"Forgot you can watch the news."
>Anon Y. Mous. Pronounced dead during the trip to the hospital via bleeding
>even then the broadcast had to censor the body due to how messed up his face was
>"Does this really happen."
>"More than you can believe."
>you could hear her voice falter for a moment.
>"But that's part of our job. We protect people, humans and anthros alike. As much as we can I'm afraid."
>the two of you sat in silence before Glyn says something else
>"Currently, we're waiting for her transport to her hearing today, I've already assigned other officers to escort her."
>clicking your tongue you stand up and leave the office not even bothering to look back
>going through the cells at the back you take a look at its sole proprietor
>the lioness had matted and unkempt fur, shaking in her bead as she was whispering to herself
>you tighten your fist in instinct but you decide to walk away
