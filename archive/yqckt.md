##### `Refusing Protection`
>The grey wifwolf stuck her head in the bag and rummaged about excitedly, 'oohing' and 'aahing' at the things you brought for today. She wanted to learn more about humans so you elected to bring whatever could be considered interesting.
>You merely sat aside as she enthusiastically explored your goodies for the day. 'Curiosity' wouldn't do her justice at the rate she was going. You knew that she's never seen stuff like this before, but you couldn't help but smile a bit at how excited she was.
>"Oh, hey, what's this?" she asks as she pulls out an object from your bag.
>It took you a few moments to register what she had pulled out, but when you realized what it was, you couldn't help but blush. "Uh, that's what people call a 'condom.'"
>"A condom?" she repeats back to you. "What's it do?"
>"Well...." you scratch the back of your head for a few seconds, trying to formulate the best way to explain it. Funny enough, it never occured to you to ever use condoms when you two ever had sex. Hell, with how she gets sometimes, it would practically be futile asking her to wait so you can put one on. "Well, ya see, a condom is used by human men during sex."
>"Really?" she says, clearly enraptured by the object she held between her fingers. Her expression was priceless, she stared at it as if entranced, reminding you of a kid who got what they wanted for Christmas. "Can you show me how it works then?"
>"Er, I mean, I could, but it's not something that I can just slip on. I would have to be hard before putting it on and..." You don't even get a chance to explain before she rushes over to you, getting straight to the point and pulling down your pants and underwear, exposing your manhood.
>"So all I have to do is get you hard? That's easy."

>"Hey, wait a sec..." your protests are immediately cut short when you feel her rough tongue get to work. She merely grins a bit at you getting stopped in your tracks. She started off tantalizingly slow, making sure to cover every inch of your cock with her tongue, making you buck into her instinctively.
> Her eyes stared directly back into yours as she completely engulfed your member in her maw, her nose resting right into your crotch, before pulling back all the way and giving a long lick to your tip.
>Despite how good this felt, you have to remind her to stop, otherwise you'll have to wait a little bit before being able to put the condom on.
>You're barely able to formulate words to catch her attention: "Hey, remember the whole wanting me to put the condom on? I can't do that if you make me cum already."
>She gets the hint and stops from the sensual blowjob. Reluctantly, she pulls back, and sits on her knees, wagging her tail in anticipation and staring intently at what you do next.
>You sit upright on your knees and begin to slide the condom on. You never had much reason to use one as of late, but it's easy to remember how they work.
>"Well, tada..." you say as you let your rubber coated cock stand at attention for her.
>She tilts her head to the side a bit out of intrigue at the combination. She moves her hand to inspect the new sight before her. "It feels strange." She wraps a hand around your member and begins to slowly move her hand up and down, not really trying to jerk you off, merely trying to get familiar with the protection.
>"Can you still feel things?"
>"Yeah, just not as much."

>She begins to scoot back a bit as she lowers her head towards your dick, giving cursory sniffs at the condom that was covering it. "Smells even stranger." Without warning, she begins to give short but quick licks, true to her curious nature, really trying to know everything about this new thing. "Are you sure you can even feel anything? I miss being able to taste you directly."
>"Y-yeah. I still can, obviously just not as good as doing it without."
>"If that's how you feel, then why do humans bother using these silly things?" she asks as she pulls away and sits upright again.
>"Well, if anything, it's mainly to prevent pregnancies."
>"WHAT!" she practically shrieks at the revelation.
>Not the reaction you were hoping for, but should've seen that coming one way or another.
>"Why would humans do such a thing!? Sex without a chance for pregnancy is against the way nature intends it."
>"I get what you mean, but think about it, not everyone wants the pressure of children, nor is everyone who has sex really ready for the chance of children in the slightest."
>She still looks at you in disbelief, as if her entire understanding of life got turned upside down.
>"Can I hold it?" she asks. Not seeing any reason to distrust her, you pull it off and hand it to her. She looks it over, a touch of anger slowly creeping up her face.
>"Well that's not how we're doing things, mister." she says as she begins to tear it to shreds with her sharp teeth. She then spits out the rubbery remains in disgust.

>She turns back to you and stares at you with a deep predatory gaze. You've seen that look enough times to know what comes next. Without even a chance to react, she pins you to the ground with both her arms and stares down at you with a look that could kill.
>"Sweetie, you weren't planning on using that with me, were you?" she asks in a slow, ominous tone.
>You'd best choose your words carefully, or you won't feel your hips until tomorrow. "Uh, of course not, dearest. I'd never do that to you."
>Seemingly content with your answer, her intense stare becomes relaxed into her bedroom eyes look.
>"Good boy." She says as she leans down to kiss you. You both share a brief kiss before she breaks off, leans to your side and licks your face. She whispers into your ear: "Because you and I are going to breed until I'm swollen with pups, and we won't stop at just two or three." You shudder in a mixture of arousal and concern at the demand she set forth.
>She licks you again and begins to work her way downward. ("Something tells me I'm gonna be sore tomorrow after all.")
