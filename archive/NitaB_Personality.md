#Roleplay Profile

#### Character Name
Nita Balor

#### Character Description
A svelte sanguine sorceress seeking succor from her tragic backstory(TM)

#### Character Personality
At best an upbeat source of warmth, at worst a spiteful spitfire. Usually she's just a gremlin making bad jokes and references to fire.

#### Character Backstory
What's worse? A story you don't like to think about or one you can never tell? Nita is burdened by one that she can neither speak about nor ever forget as each detail is burned into her memory. A struggle for survival deep in a dangerous dungeon, betrayal around every corner as her companions discovered her vampiric nature, accidental immolation of friends as her magical abilities awaken. Arc was at least kind enough to leaver Nita with her sanity in tact. 

#### Goals
Atonement for her accidents.
Try to walk in the sun like she did before becoming a vampire.
Embrace Uzza's afterlife and explore multiple worlds.

#### Violence Comfort Level
Moderate. I don't mind a fight but I don't want to see my femur sticking out of my leg.

#### Lewd Okay?
Do you want dust for a dick? This is how you get dust for a dick.
Truthfully I don't mind, Nita will most likely flirt absentmindedly but I can't write horny to save my life.

#### Kinks
Nothing hardcore, extreme, or disgusting to society at large.
I tolerate most everything else.
Ask and you shall receive.
