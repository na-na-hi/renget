>Years have passed
>That nice American boy and I are MARRIED now
>And not a common-law marriage
>We had a ceremony and everything
>Kami, it feels like a lifetime ago that a nice American exchange student dropped into my life
>Now I'm an American citizen
>My neighbors don't think of me as a criminal
>They think of me as a kindly, graceful immigrant lady
>My relatives back in Japan are happy for me and the family I've built here
>My in-laws adore our children
>Our oldest takes so much after his father
>It probably won't be long before he sweeps some lucky girl off her feet
>People sometimes ask me if I ever regret marrying him
>I tell them I never do
>Because I was raised to tell the truth
>I feel a stir next to me
>"Did I wake you up, honey?"
>"Nah."
>He rolls over and starts spooning me
>Sometimes I still feel like that shy schoolgirl he charmed all those years ago
>I hope he never stops making me feel that way
>"I'm so lucky I met you," he whispers in my ear
>'Not as lucky as I am to have met you', I think, as we slowly drift back off to sleep
