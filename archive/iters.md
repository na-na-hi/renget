There were many rumors floating around Cover's HQ. One of them concerned the vtuber Omaru Polka, other staff members were saying she took tier 2 and 3 members to her rape dungeon. Of course, that was nothing but a joke, Manager-chan had known Polka for two years now and had gone to her place a few times. She lived in a modest apartment in a 5 stories building, and didn't seem to own any studio or other places. There was nowhere for Polka to even own a rape dungeon.

Or so M-chan thought. It was a bit harder to deny its existence in her current situation. She was naked except for her underwear, her wrists were held above her head by a rope, her legs were bound together, her upper half was tied in a turtle bondage and she could feel a knot dig into her crotch whenever she tried to move. She could feel a ball gag in her mouth, drool was slowly dripping from her chin as her mouth was forced open. She was tied and forced to stand in the middle of the room and could see Polka sat on a chair near the door.

Her expression was full of curiosity and her gaze was focused intensely on M-chan's face. She didn't move for her few minutes, and one could have thought she wasn't blinking at all if they weren't paying attention. After what seemed like an hour, the fennec finally stood up and approached her captive. What was she going to do? Threaten, rape, or even kill her? The clown stopped in front of her, stood still for a moment before groping her chest and saying a simple word:

"Honk!"

It really was a clown world out there.
