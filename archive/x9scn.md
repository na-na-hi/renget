## ->**History and Overview**<-
The land of the Retro Reich used to be a lawless land of small Tribes fighting each other, alliances were swift and always changing. One day a spaceship crashed in these lands and on its crash site it revealed what is now known as Onobots. The Onobots did not understand why passing this Planet brought them down to it, and they never would as the crash proved so fatal that it destroyed nearly all that was aboard including all data storage, leaving the Onobots that survived with only what was included on their own OS in order to get their bearings and no memories of their own. The tribes fearing the new beings from this crash attacked the robots to exterminate them as well as secure whatever they might think could be of use to them from the crashed ship, but the Onobots proved too strong a foe for the tribe's primitive ways. One tribe, the tribe of the Hill, however decided to rather watch from the sidelines and gather information instead of fighting as was tradition for their Tribe, wich made them notice that the Onobots fighting more for self-defense rather than aggressively, thus they tried to strike up negotiations to secure them as allies instead. Learning that the Onobots followed what they called their Mother-Unit, Onolumi, and that this being was rather curious and fond of the humanoids, the tribe of the Hill decided to guide the Onobots with their knowledge of the other tribes to victory securing the Land for their alliance to rule in peace.

Soon after the tribes were united under the Onobots, the land was struck my several Cyclones in short succession. This led to the destruction of much farmland as well as crippling many tribes that got hit by the worst. What followed was a period of great unrest. The migration of survivors to other tribes and the lack of food led to starvation and death all over the land, bad hygiene and corpses made this even worse as disease spread like a wildfire. The nation was in shambles and the Onobots lacked the knowledge to support the people appropriately. Help from tribes outside the Nation also was sparse, as they kept to themselves and tried to avoid the land as to not invite problems to their own homes. It was in this trying times that a light of salvation came from a far away place and the nation of anya-petra provided much needed aid from across the ocean. They brought food and medicine to the land and sold it at a huge loss for themselves, they even went so far and allowed some Dreamweavers to migrate to their own lands, lessening the mouth to feed in the Retro Reich. Thanks to this selfless act, the Retro Reich managed to find the strength to rebuild itself. People nowadays have mostly forgotten of this period in time, but to the Onobots this help was an act that they would not forget, and as such even today anya-petra is seen with great esteem within the Retro Reich.

A long time has since passed and the Retro Reich has grown to be a grand mercantile country with many of its merchants and scholars traveling the world around not only to trade for profit or learn of the history of the world, but also to collect old and/or broken technology of other countries for their own to bring back to the Reich. Onolumi, now ruling Queen of the Retro Reich is said to be fond of these old technologies as well as their own tales and stories and is said to grant great favor to those that bring her ones that please her and many Onobots, now making up a good portion of the Upper Class, seem to actively seek them by any chance they can get in order to fulfill their Queens mission. Many people of different places have migrated to the Reich that share into these interests with the majority hailing from the lands of /tsun/ and the isle of /pyon/ and together with the descents of the Tribe of Hill make up the majority of the Land working towards the goals of gaining older technology. For that reason too, the Land sees many Smiths and Workshops dedicated to the Art of maintaining, repairing and enhancing these old technologies, wich has led to the Retro Reich being known as the Place in the World of some of the finest craftsman. Many of these Workshops follow their own small deities instead of the major Deities of the land, believing their Deity to bring them the true enlightenment of their Arts. Besides quarrels here and there, the country is of a very peaceful nature to an almost frightening degree, with many believing that the way of "Holding it in" stemming from the Hill-Tribe in its older days might somehow be the cause of this. 

## ->**Society**<-
The Queen herself lives very secluded and is represented by a small Council that is ruling mostly in her Stead.
The Upper Class is made up mainly by Onobots as well as descendants of the Hill-Tribe tho also earlier immigrants from amongst the Buckos of /tsun/ and Champyons from /pyon/ can be found, besides them there is also the Representative of the individual Workshops, who mediates between the Workshops and brings their needs and demands before the Representatives of the Queen.
The middle and lower classes are a wild mix of many nationalities and immigrants, as well as the occasional Onobots that prefer a more modest style of life, due to the open nature of the Country itself with a good portion being descendants of the Hill-Tribe, Buckos or Champyons that immigrated earlier than most.
The general population wears clothes similar to the Caribbean settlers around 1600~1700 with a love for colorful dyed clothes. Men particular seem to enjoy blue for their pants. Onobots on the other Hand prefer to wear very flashy robes with lots of engraving, paired with many accessories like amulets and wristbands to make them more easily distinguishable for the general populace.
Workshops love to have competitions and demonstrations of their works to show of their skills and compete with other workshops, a few times a year these events even take on the form of big fairs that can spawn city wide and are enjoyed by all. Robots also love to buy carrots to a degree that if it is known that a big haul is going to be for sale, they will hold friendly competitions to see who gets to buy more than the others 
Rum is the most widespread alcohol due to it being produced locally but thanks to the strong merchant presence liquors from all over the world can be enjoyed for a fair price. Beer in particular has enjoyed a big boom, especially amongst the Sect of Hank Hill who will procure large amounts for their barbecues. People usually like to meet up in random grouping at the side of the streets to have friendly chats while drinking or enjoy a good hearty karaoke while under influence 
Songs of simple but memorable melodies, that can easily be hummed even, are preferred over more technical and complicated songs 
the most common folk simply go by a first name with no real rhyme or reason but people working for a workshop are allowed to use their shops name as Surname as a sign of prestige. Robots are named after a production code that however makes no sense to anyone but themselves, rarely do their adapt a simple name to show favor of the general populace 

## ->**Religion**<-
Queen Onolumi is worshiped by all Onobots to a fanatical degree, but is also the Patron of many who wish not to worship any of the other Deities or have a strong religious belief. Robots will share erotic arts they call "homework" amongst the general populace that they received from Onolumi and will sternly express to learn from it and encourage people to produce "homework" of their own that they can then buy and offer their goddess in return 
Amiya from the land of /tsun/ is mainly worshiped by immigrants from /tsun/ and they have more of a foothold in the Scholarly side of the country that focus on gathering history of the world and having most of their workshops focused on tools that aid in that procedure. Scholars are holding mass at least once a month to share their knowledge with the masses.
Kiki from the land of /pyon/ is mainly worshiped by immigrants of /pyon/ and have a big focus on the local agriculture of the Country with their Workshops being mostly focused on that endeavor, tho they also have a side interest in defensive weaponry since they often have to defend themselves due to the controversial nature of their Chuuba in many peoples eyes. Their love for carrots is something frowned upon by Queen Onolumi herself, but is still a thriving business due to the Onobots actively encouraging the plantation of carrots for some unknown reason. Kiki's followers will try to sail back to /pyon/ as often as possible to be in the grace of their goddess 
The worship of Hank Hill is strong in descends of the Hill-Tribe and many of the older immigrants of the country, and they have a big impact on the health industry, both mentally and physically, as well as the logistical infrastructure of the country with their workshops focusing on this. Many rumors claim that they use these footholds in the country to somehow suppress the emotions of the people with dubious use of Copium. For Hank Hill followers it is a great pride to hold big and lavish barbecues and offer anyone willing hospitality and a good meal. 
Workshops all over the country will worship a wide array of Chuubas that they believe will bring out their true potential in their arts. This leads to what seems like a very eccentric industrial zone in wich people will do all kinds of rituals to appease their Chuubas. Those rituals can vary from wearing clothes designed for the opposite gender to singing songs while working or even trying to imitate animals.
The dead will usually be sent out to the sea with their favorite tool in life so that they may offer it to their oshi once they reach their ports in the heavenly realm
Onobots however are very particular about recovering every corpse of themselves that they hear about in order to recycle them to repair themselves or create new Onobots from the parts 

## ->**Locations**<-

### Capital
Capital is the Capital City of the Retro Reich and build where the Onobots first crashed upon the world. It features a main Castle build partly out of pieces from the Spaceship they used to traverse the skies. There in the Throne Room, Onolumi is reigning the Nation tho no one ever was allowed an audience with her or has seen her at all. Nowadays Capital is a flourishing city with a huge market and harbor fitting for the capital city of a maritime trading nation.

### Shipyard Stationtown
Shipyard Stationtown is less a traditional city but more the result of Shipyard docks, and the buildings to support them, slowly merging together over time into one, almost 200 km long city. The depths of the city however barely reaches a single kilometer as buildings to support the docks are built all around them and on top of each other, creating a huge almagation of wood, stone and rope, where places often need to be reached via ladders or bridges. and a pub could be "hanging" a hundred meters off ground only supported by beams built towards its surroundings. The place is everchanging as it fits itself for the desires of the free spirited workers who also shape it to meet the demands for their creations. A ship being canceled could suddenly become a place to life and party in, while somwhere else some older part gets cleaned up for a new dock.

## ->**Military**<-
The primary focus of the Reich's military is focussed upon their Navy, wich is used actively as escorts for the many merchant ships of the country and is thus well-trained and maintained at all times. Due to Onobots however investing a lot into it without properly telling the Navy officials about it the proper size of it is unknown, the rough estimates of its size is as followed:

**Ship-of-the-Line**
3 1st Ranks
8-10 2nd Ranks
28-33 3rd Ranks

**Frigates**
22-30 4th Ranks
45-55 5th Ranks

**Corvettes and Brigs**
60-80 Corvettes
40-50 Brigs

These numbers would be supplemented by 300-500 Merchant ships that are constructed in a way to function as small Ship-of-the-Line, Frigates or Corvettes in time of need depending on their individuell size as well as unclear number of vastly older ships that the Retro Reich still maintains but would be vastly outclassed by modern ships and would only play a supportive role in times of need.

The Ground forces in return tend to be rather small, with only the bare minimum maintained to keep order for the country. This however can lead to many underestimating these Forces, wich can be supplemented by the usually not involved Onobots of the country. Each Onobot, due to their nature of being made of metal as well as having no need for sleep or food, is able to handle many enemies at once and are known to be one of the worst enemies to face in any war of attrition or siege. They are however low in numbers and tend to not involve themselves in battle unless they deem it necessary.

## ->**Economy**<-
The Economy of the Retro Reich is flourishing, with a big focus of the country lieing in Trade around the Globe. Most merchants will travel for long stretches of time to sell goods around the World for profit and only returning once they gathered sufficient amounts of technologies for themselves besides their profits. With the workshop's industry producing lots of product besides that wich make for great export, the country experiences little poverty.
The Country itself is rich in Ores like Gold and Copper, as well as Gemstones like Quartz and Amethyst. Some of the most common Crops and Yields include fruits like Mango and Pineapple, Vegetables like Carrots and Cucumbers, with other harvests like tea, vanilla, tobacco and sugar cane also being very prevalent.

## ->**Chuubanite**<-
Retro Chuubanite has been found to enhance the quality of items that have an emotional value attached to them, for example, a longtime used shield by a war veteran enhanced with Retro Chuubanite seems to withstand stronger attacks while seeming lighter to carry. The exact nature of how this works is not known but based on studies either a strong attachment by the person using the item or a general fondness of the item by the masses seem to work well with more emotional bonds by more people achieving a stronger result. This effect however can even go further in that items build out of material that had an emotional value attached to it before also seems to carry this effect over to the item build, for example a tree that was cherished in a public park would result in wood that can then give an enhancing factor to items produced with said wood. This furthers the desire of the People to procure as much old technologies and resources as possible.

It can also be used to restore things by reversing the process of rusting or molding for example. This allows even the most ancient relics to be restored into a functional state.

When the personal emotions of an Individuell towards a certain item are strong and exist in the form of a clear image, people can also perform a state of "Soulbinding" with an item. For this to function the item itself needs to have been enhanced or processed with Retro Chuubanite beforehand which then functions as a conductor, there needs to be sufficient Chuubanite in the athmosphere around the item and person to be able to be absorbed to fuel the Soulbind and a strong emotional state of the person that functiosn as the trigger of the Soulbind.
