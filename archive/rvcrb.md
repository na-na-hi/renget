>DISCIPLES

>Yasha
**In the fires of battle, a flash and a rush.**

“We’ve met. Despite the rumours he seemed upstanding, and his actions certainly spoke to that. If, in the future, we happen to meet and he requires my assistance, I’d gladly lend it. Though… I can’t help but feel he looked down on me, at least a little bit.”

>Ming Ming
**Clink and clank, the sound of society rings out.**

“I don’t like merchants, as a rule, but dealing with them is a necessity. Rather than scrunch up my nose and act superior, I’d rather resign myself to the deal and have it over with. As far as merchants go, though, she seems amicable, which is a dangerous thing in and of itself.”

>Zheng Hao
**A wanderer on the road, sent by calamity and called by purpose**- No wait, this sounds too pretentious. I’ll come back to this one.

“Out of all the people I’ve talked about, this one is the one I’d most like to learn more about. In a word, conflicted about his purpose. A healer by nature, in a world that values war. Nonetheless, his path is a long one yet to be walked, with a clear goal in sight. He is, of course, me.”

>Nobu
**A brief encounter at a glance, tainted by the scent of blood.**

“We met, briefly. It was empty, mere platitudes before we parted ways. In a word, forgettable. Well, if not for the unmistakable scent of blood. I doubt many would pick up on that, but as a doctor, I’d never miss that metallic scent. If we ever meet again, I’ll be far more on guard, as I feel I may have just barely escaped with my life intact, regardless of how innocent our meeting seemed to me.”

>Yexin
**A wild beast without a care, for blood and fury is simply its ken.**

“Have I met her? Yes, once. It was certainly a situation, but- No, I didn’t get to learn too much about the scriptures she’s said to wield, so I wasn’t able to verify anything. No, I didn’t push - I’m not that impolite. I was tempted to at least ask, though. Despite the supposed brutality she has a reputation for, she did a noble deed when we met. Besides, she was quite the chef.”

>Lord Charles Maynard
**Stranger from afar, alone and unafraid.**

“A strange foreigner? Not unheard of. No, I’ve never met him. Yes, this is the first I’m hearing about him. Would you tell me more?”

>Heng Zhiqiang
*Instead of attempting a poetic rendering, Zheng Hao instead suddenly leans forward, his gaze intense, a fire alight, cutting off his conversational partner.*

“Yes! I’ve heard of him, of course! Elusive as he may be, the Golden Man is a subject of intense curiosity of mine! His manipulations of fate, and how-”

*Zheng Hao pauses, and forcibly closes his eyes, sitting back down, and waiting a moment.*

“No. I apologise for my outburst. I’ve heard in passing about his latest victim. Such infliction of suffering is more than distasteful, it’s vicious. To have everything ripped away from you in such a manner… It’s simply that the Golden Man may have what I ultimately seek. If there’s a chance- no, again, I apologise. Could we change the topic?”

*The young doctor’s face, normally well composed, is flushed red with shame, having put aside compassion for personal gain, even if just in thought and only for a moment.*

>Dónall
**A strange beast following a righteous road.**

“Yet again, you prove your knowledge of current goings-on over mine. No, I’ve not heard tell of this beast, but as you describe him, he holds a righteous heart, and such a thing, I think, is more necessary than ever in this world.”

>Qiang Wei
**A warrior with no bounds, with but a spear as his companion.**

“Yes, we’ve met. Qiang Wei is admirable. His disposition is good, and his strength is unquestionable. *Reliable*, I think, is my impression in a single word. From what I know, I empathise with his history. He’s ruthless, too, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. He’s not bloodthirsty, and he has righteousness in his heart.”

>ELDERS
***
>The Boneless Old Man
**Carve and inscribe, a man with the spine to follow the hard path**

“No, don’t mention it. Please. That poem is a tribute, but if you say anything I’ll- yes, we met briefly. He saved my life, actually, after I’d just barely escaped from some less reputable folk. His healing technique is remarkable, for certain. I’d like to meet again, if fate allows. I have a feeling I could learn a lot from him, perhaps even expand my Five Elements Internal Classic on the back of his wisdom.”

>Dong Do

“I’ve heard of Sect Leader Dong, of course, but aside from what many could tell you, I have no specifics I’m afraid. Oh, the poem? I feel like it would be disrespectful, wouldn’t it?”

>Xiu Yi
“I’ve… heard, of course.”

*Zheng Hao’s face twists into a grimace for a brief moment before he composes himself.*

“I can’t fathom why one would turn on their own family, and I have nothing more to say on the matter. *Nothing more*.”

>Guan Chāo
**A plague and devil in one, twisted and wicked among death and decay.**

“I’ve come across his handiwork before, but I was barely able to save myself, let alone help his victims- what? The poem? This is a monster, a devil in human flesh. Why *should* I respect him? As I was saying, he is truly dangerous. More so than a poisoner, for he can leave a seed of death and move on, leaving destruction in his wake long after his presence has faded. Perhaps next time, I can act swifter and gather more information, start to formulate a method to fight back his wickedness and argue against his teachings, but you’re not here for my scholarly opinion as a physician, are you?”

>Gyldenwulf
**A rabid wolf on the hunt, awaiting the hunter to claim his pelt.**

“A destructive force. Once, I’d have refused to believe the tales, but having travelled as I have, it no longer surprises me that people will live like this. I can’t say for certain, having not met him, but I feel he should not continue on his path. Had I the strength, I’d seek to put him down myself, but as fate would have it, I simply would be the one to die. I can only hope we never meet, despite my curiosity. I have no wish to be put in a situation where my only chance is to pray for providence.”

>Huang Yu
**A journey ‘round the world, ends in disaster at the return.**

“I’ve heard of The Polished Grains Form The Immortal Peak, naturally. How could I not? I would wish that the Seven Clouds Medicine School never falls to the same state that The Polished Grains Form the Immortal Peak has, but such a wish would be for naught, as we already have reached that same state. If we ever meet, I will offer what-ever assistance I can, small as it may be. To reach out to others in need is the right thing to do, and I can only hope, somewhere, sometime, others may do the same for us.”

>Shu Luxing
*Zheng Hao, rather than wording a poem, tilts his head.*

“I’ve… heard the name, but I must be mistaken. Could you elaborate? Hm. That sounds accurate but surely it couldn’t… I met a Shu Luxing just as you describe, but she was no cultivator, but a commoner. It was in one of my stops to treat the woes of the mortal folk. Perhaps I failed to detect her status. Alas, were I omniscient, my life would be much simpler. Much more boring, though, I must imagine.”

>Moriko

“A fox spirit? No, I’ve never had the displeasure. You’re not making these people up, are you? Well, it’s just, you’ve asked about some very strange individuals and… just how well travelled do you think I am? I’m only nineteen years of age!”

>Morgain Blackheart

“The name is striking, memorable. I remember hearing in passing about them, but I’m no bounty hunter. I have no desire to chase them down. There’s plenty of good I can do on my path already. If we cross paths?”

*Zheng Hao chuckles, seemingly amused.*

“I suppose I’ll try to avoid conflict. If I had to, though, I’d step in. I’m not afraid of death. How could I be? I seek to conquer it. If I feared it, I’d be lost already.”

>Jian
**A blade thirsting for blood, cursed and caring not where it cuts.**

“Another devil. The Honest Blade Pavilion makes claims, but they’re hollow excuses. They’re *killers*, plain and simple, devils just like those who aimed to destroy the Seven Clouds Medicine School. Purity in forsaking nobility- what a *farce*. A blade that destroys all it comes across is merely a blade gone mad. Without control, you are not its master, but it is yours, and that is **death** for a cultivator.”

>Mei Lan
**A servant, true at heart and**-

“Wait, I started talking without thinking. You’re messing with me right now. A maid? No, seriously, a maid?! You need to be drinking less wine and more tea, right now. I can’t believe you said it with a straight enough face that I started composing a poem…”

>Wen Lifen
*Zheng Hao nearly chokes, spitting out his tea, a blush rising on his face.*

“Wen Lifen? *The devil courtesan*? What kind of opinion, exactly, do you want me to spout? Or do you just want a poem of- no, I’d much rather not. I’ve given my opinion on other similar devil cultivators, and those will have to suffice, because you won’t get any more specifics.”

>Lei Daiyu
**A rising thunder on the air, evil disappears with the flash of its light**

“I know of her in passing. We’ve… not met, no, but I would perhaps like to. There are certain elements that bear some familiarity to me that I’d like to compare and confirm. Why are you accusing me now, of not having met many people of note! It’s not *my* fault I don’t socialise with those realms above me!”

>Leanne Pierpoint

“A… flag bearer?”

*Zheng Hao scratches his head briefly, face poised in thought.*

“Oh! Another foreigner, huh? No, not much to say here, sadly. If you don’t have much to tell me, don’t ask me about them!”

>Kay Lee

“Another barbarian? Please, I’ve already said enough. This one’s different? From another world…?”

*Zheng Hao sighs briefly, retreating to his tea for a moment’s thought, brows furrowed.*

“It’s not unheard of. Still notable, I suppose. Certainly, there’s merit in learning whatever I could about where this one is from. I couldn’t care less that some arrogant fool tried to throw their weight around and got beat down; besides, I’m not a bounty hunter, so why would a bounty be significant to me?”

>Xicotl

“Ah. This one. I’ve heard tell, and all I have to say is that he and I share an incompatible view of the world. For one who can accept suffering and injustice, pain and death, as irrevocable and inevitable, I can only deny them with all of my heart. To lay down and accept that as a fate inescapable is cowardice, plain and simple, it is the sign of a warrior with no heart, a man with no spirit. I deny it all. I must and I will. Death, the end of an existence, is *the only* universal enemy, and I hate it. **I hate it!** Even if it takes all my life, I will defeat it. I swear it!”

*Zheng Hao slowly lessens his grip, releasing the shards and dust that previously made up his teacup.*

“I… I’ll pay for that.”

>Lan Jiangmei
*Zheng Hao waits as his conversational partner describes this latest individual, only smiling calmly as they quip at his likely lack of knowledge once more. But, surprisingly, he begins to speak a poem.*

**To travel and fight in a ruthless era, only to enjoy a warm meal.**

“We’ve met, actually. It’s not like I’ve never met any other cultivators, you’ve just been asking me about some strange ones. Though, I say we met, but in truth it was brief, and more of a… passing by? I had quite the time sensitive task at the time, and it was some time ago. I only regret that I didn't stop and partake of a meal.”


>ANCESTORS
***
>Xū

“Yet again, you’re messing with me. What could I possibly know about such a venerable ancestor? Maybe if you’d give up some of your fate, I could meet as many colourful people as you seem to have.”

>Shu Shihan
**For every carp, there lies a dragon. For every dragon, there lies an immortal. For every immortal, there lies the heavens.**

“Simply a reminder that you will always find those more powerful than yourself. If you live in fear of such a fact, then you will cower beside the road, instead of walking the path.”

>Magikarp

“You’re laughing, but this is a serious matter. Things are not always as they seem on the surface, and to judge a tale so quickly might just lead to your death one day.”

>Zhihao Cheng
*Zheng Hao’s lips curl in distaste, or perhaps pain. A genuine display of displeasure.*

“Ugh. *Bureaucrats*.”

>Po Kong
*Zheng Hao ponders for a moment, though he has no tea to ponder over.*

“Remember what I said about the mystical carp? I think this applies here, too. Things are not always as they seem.”

>Chenrezig Bodhisattva

“I don’t know the true intricacies of Buddhism, and I’d not want to appear impolite, so I think I’ll just state that I disagree.

>Fen Jiange

“We’ve met. I’d rather not have the displeasure of doing so again, and I suspect were this outlook to reach the one in question, I’d have gained a very powerful enemy. I doubt the words of a lowly being such as I would even reach his consideration, however.”

>Meng Zhen

“Another fox spirit? No, as I’ve said, I’ve not had the displeasure. Her goal? Could we not talk about this? I’m getting dangerously close to thinking you’re trying to accuse me of something…”
