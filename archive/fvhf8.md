**How to apply cheat codes:**
1. Start the game.
2. At the top left, go to `Tools -> Cheats -> List`.
3. Click on `Action Replay` button.
4. Copy desired cheat code and paste it into the `Code` input.
5. Copy the cheat code's comment/function and paste it into the `Description` input.
6. (Optionally) Disable `turn on code`, if you don't want to activate it right away.

`Note`: Try to look up more codes on the internet yourself, but not all of them might work. You'll have to test them yourself.
