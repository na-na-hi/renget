#####-> ![](https://pixelbank.neocities.org/decome/computers%20and%20electronics/c0849ecb.gif) What Is Animash *?* <-
-> *Animash is a type of fanvid set to music or other audio featuring footage from animated works involving feral-style animals. The name comes from "animal mashup." Animashes have been created since the 2000s. Creators of animashes are known as "animashers."* <-
-> A simplistic definition taken from [Fanlore](https://fanlore.org/wiki/Animash) if you're looking for a more in-depth definition feel free to [click here](https://animash.fandom.com/wiki/Animash) <-

#####-> ![](https://pixelbank.neocities.org/decome/phones/b1d3b335.gif) What qualifies as Animash *?* <-
-> The answer can really differ from person to person, but most seem to follow this checklist: <-
- [ ] it is an animated movie
- [ ] it has animals
- [ ] the characters have their locomotive members and moviments closely accurate to reality

if you check 2 or more: animash
if you check 1 or none: not animash

-> Checklist insighted from [belovsleya.](https://youtube.com/@belovsleya.) <-
-> Although this checklist is rather accurate. if you think of doing collabs or even join MEPs *(Multiple Editor Projects)* they can have their own set of rules and won't allow certain medias. For an example: Nothing childish such as The Lion Guard, My Little Pony and etc or only classic animash medias like The Lion King, Balto, Oliver & Company <-
-> *if your simply doing your own projects then feel free to ignore the above statements as they're just examples of rules that MIGHT be there for any collab projects* <-
