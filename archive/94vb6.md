##### ->*Description*<-
*A young man (quite young, even; though he insists that he’s an adult at the ripe age of XX) on the adventure of his life, our hero finds himself in the city of Argomery, an endless, highly advanced civilization of monsters that exists in another dimension. Standing at a whopping 5’ 1”, few would believe the strength he contains in such a small form. An accomplished swordsman, Anon prefers the nonviolent solution to disagreements despite his prowess, but is not one to shy away from a fight, no matter how intimidating the opponent. Born and raised in the kingdom of Cover, the squire-turned-adventurer’s quest began during an attack on the castle near his home during a training session, by a dragon no less!*

*Charging into the flames, he challenged the dragon to single combat…and against all odds, found himself the victor – nearly ruining a plan by the king in the process. As such, Anon was thrust into the middle of a large conspiracy by force, and given a task; to show the people of Argomery that humans aren’t all bad as part of a greater plan to have humanity and monster kind live together in peace. Working together with the very dragon he defeated – the queen of the infinite city of Argomery, Coco Kiryu – Anon will stop at nothing to complete the mission of peace he’s been given by his king. Kind-hearted and strong, if not a little hotheaded and dense, he finds himself in seemingly more and more extreme situations…but that’s just part of being a hero, or so he says. Unbeknownst to him, the Gods have taken a special interest in his adventure and are keen on ensuring that the path of most resistance is always taken, usually to his detriment, but a little divine intervention isn't going to stop him anytime soon!*

###### ->MP - A numerical measurement of the amount of arcane energy one can safely channel: 30 <-

***"HP" is an abstract way of referring to Anon's overall ability to endure physical and mental trauma. What having low health means changes from situation to situation. In most cases, though, it usually means he's on the verge of slipping into shock from blood loss, grievous bodily harm, etc. From there, he's as good as dead (or captured, or any other nasty thing his opponent may have in mind) if no one comes to his aid, so be wary. Armor - represented by DMG Reduction - can absorb blows entirely, or at the very least lessen their impact and allow Anon to hold on just a bit longer. But even then, armor may be useless against certain foes who would fell the Hero without ever directly doing him physical harm...***

- ***Arachne Silk Tunic*** - 2DMG Reduction - A white tunic made from woven arachne silk; a material harder than steel. Worn as an undershirt.
- ***Obsiweave Jacket*** - 3DMG Reduction – A thin, glossy black gambeson worn over the tunic, made of material soaked in liquified, enchanted obsidian. Capable of stopping several things, including but not limited to great sword strikes and ballista shots.
- ***Unseen Midnight Mantle*** - 5DMG Reduction - A black hooded mantle with an eight pointed star composed of a strange silvery material on the back. Said material completes a trim that goes along the entire back portion of the mantle. It’s complete with a silver chain connecting the two pieces around your shoulders together and keeping it secure. The inner portion of the garment pulses a strange blue sheen slowly, giving away its magical properties at a glance. Also known as ‘Arkid’s Mantle’. Special chemical treatment from a certain vampire has granted it the ability to function as an invisibility cloak, draining 5MP/turn.

######->Total DMG reduction - 10 <-

***

#####->Equipment and Accessories<-
######->*Current strengths, listed with when they were obtained. The hero grows stronger over time.*<-

- *Chapter One:* ***Soul Striker*** - 1D20 DMG. A sword given to you by King Yagoo to commemorate the start of your quest, enchanted by Coco to be entirely nonlethal. The blade passes through flesh and causes severe pain but will not draw blood. A weapon of great power.
- *Chapter Six, Part Three:* ***Soul Sealer*** - 1D20 DMG. An evolved form of the Soul Striker, supposedly formed from the actions you've carried out manifesting physically. The blade almost appears to have a will of its own, but can be influenced by thought. Make it heavier, make it lighter...even potentially remove the 'nonlethal' attachment if you wish, rendering it able to deal a killing blow. Unlocks the *Sealing Slash* ability.
- *Chapter Three:* ***Grappler Gauntlets*** - Sorcery-infused gauntlets that allow you to grapple onto ceilings or walls using a ghostly tendril of azure energy. Can be used defensively to catch attacks and misdirect them, or offensively with the skill Round Raid. Also lets you grab things from far away!
- *Chapter Three:* ***Powerful Coat*** - Add 5DMG to attacks following a perfect dodge. Courses with power. Helps you stay motivated.
- *Chapter Three:* ***Enchantment: Vampiric Blade*** - Heal 1D4 damage on hit. If a crit, heal 2D4.
- *Chapter Five:* ***Vampiric Blade UPGRADE: Mana Leech*** - When striking an opponent, roll 1d6. Recover the result in mana. If Soulbleed has been applied prior, recover 2 mana/turn.
- *Chapter Five:* ***Enchantment: Spellblade*** - The Soul Striker is now functional as a focus for the use of casting magic! Watch your MP!
- *Chapter Three:* ***Ring of the Daring Duelist*** - Add 5DMG to riposte (parrying) attacks. If the riposte is a critical attack, add 10 DMG instead. For example, a regular riposte would be 1D10+5, a critical would be 1D20+10. The critical dice pool still applies.
- *Chapter Four:* ***Mirage Assault Broach*** - 35% chance to repeat last attack, which can chain together with diminishing chances of landing. Success means the next roll is 17.5%, to 8.75%, etc.
- *Chapter Four:* ***Adamantine Badge*** - Projects a screen of light to reduce damage taken by 5. 40% chance to activate.
- *Chapter Four:* ***Sanguine Badge*** - On landing an attack doing over 10 DMG, call a face and flip a coin; successfully calling the face will result in *Soulbleed* being inflicted against the enemy for the remainder of the fight. (2DMG/round)
- *Chapter Seven:* ***Myrma's Loss*** - An upgraded Sanguine Badge. Bleed for 5DMG/round.
- *Chapter Four:* ***Windstorm Broach*** - +1 to rolls made to dodge an attack. If the roll would become a critical dodge, it will be treated as a normal dodge rather than a critical.
- *Chapter Five:* ***Amulet of Embers*** - 50% chance to ignore a deathblow, erupting into flames and regaining 50% HP while dealing 1D10DMG.

***

 #####-> Spells and Skills <- 
 ######->*Arcane tricks and advanced swordsman techniques, sometimes a mix of both.*<-

- *Chapter Two, Skill:* ***Round Raid*** - Technique taught to you by Polka. Roll to determine the amount of targets hit if fighting a crowd, up to a 1d6. Once per combat, throw your sword out as a devastating spinning attack that hits as it goes forward and as it returns to you. If the attack connects, deal 2D10 damage. If parried, you'll be disarmed for one turn; dodging will be your only option before you can return your sword to your grip!
- *Chapter Five, Spell:* ***Barrier Plate*** - Automatically projects a hexagonal screen of light before your left forearm at the beginning of an engagement, which functions as a shield should. The shield can be used to attempt to block following a failed dodge or parry, but doing so will consume five mana, regardless of whether it actually succeeds in stopping the attack. If it succeeds in blocking the attack, it consumes five mana more. If the attack blocking of the attack would use up the last of your mana, do not get a follow up attack. If no mana remains, the shield will break until mana is fully restored, becoming unusable. Shield will only reform if mana is fully restored.
- *Chapter Five, Skill:* ***Mirage Dance*** - Calling forth a double from your broach, unleash a deadly duet upon the opponent on demand. Renders the broach dormant for the rest of the fight. Roll 2D20 and Mirage Assault Broach activation from 25% chance to proc rather than 35%. Maximum of three procs.
- *Chapter Six, Spell:* ***Summoned Swords*** - Projectile. Roll 1D10. The result will be manifested as small, flying blades, which immediately move to impale their target. Have the opponent roll to dodge each one using a D10vD10 system. For every blade that connects, deal 5DMG. Attacks done during Attacks of Opportunity are undodgable. Mana cost: 10
- *Chapter Six, Skill:* ***Delta Cross*** - No Manacost. Two harsh diagonal attacks from differing sides, forming an 'X' on the opponent's body - a swordsman's bread and butter defense crusher, now in your hands. Able to be echoed by mirages. 2D15 DMG. 
- *Chapter Six, Hybrid:* ***Barrier Raid*** - An attack combining "Round Raid' and "Barrier Plate". Throw your weapon forward in a deadly spinning arc that automatically blocks *all attacks in a string* but consumes all of your mana and deals reduced damage. Deal 1D10 damage total and consume all mana, breaking your shield. Using this, automatically make an attack as if you blocked; does not gain +DMG modifiers from dodging or parrying. Can only be used from max mana. Critical hits (10 DMG rolled) only use half mana. 
- *Chapter Six, Hybrid:* ***Finalis Arcana*** - A violent flurry of slashing attacks in quick succession ending in a flip that smashes an opponent through the head down to the groin. Unable to be dodged or countered, and more than that, can be echoed by mirages. Small chance (25%) to leave an enemy Dazed as the attack knocks them senseless, which can also be done by mirages.  Deals 12D5 DMG, with the final hit dealing 1D10. Uses 10MP.
- *Chapter Six, Spell:* ***Mana Crash*** - Channel every bit of mana into a devastating downward strike. Every point of mana used adds 5DMG to the base damage done by the attack. Swinging your sword downward, create a small nova at the point of impact, dealing 1D20+5/MP remaining DMG. 50% chance to leave an enemy Dazed. Critical strikes increase DMG bonus to 2D20+10/MP and leaves the target Dazed, guaranteed. Uses all Mana. ***In times of great need, can be overcharged by drawing energy from your very soul, risking severe consequences in the process. For every point of mana overcharged, roll 1d6. On a 6, take 15 unavoidable, armor-piercing damage - losing all HP to overcharging is fatal.***
- *Chapter Six, Skill:* ***Sealing Slash*** - A technique that can be used to temporarily nullify an opponent’s abilities, magical or physical - a way of true pacification that affects the person’s core to bring them to heel.
- When a *Critical Hit!* lands, once per encounter Anon can opt to turn the critical attack into a *Sealing Slash*. The attack does no extra damage inherently and cannot be rerolled by illusions, but instead applies a random effect. Roll a 1d6 to determine.
1: *Aegis Crush* - The target’s Damage Threshold reduced by 5 for the rest of the fight. In essence, every attack now does +5 DMG. If an opponent is armored, this will nullify up to 5 points of DMG reduction.
2: *Burning Soul* - Target experiences a horrible burning sensation for the rest of the fight, dealing 8DMG/round. Stacks with *Soul Bleed* for a total DoT of 12/round, up to 18/round!!
3: *Resolve Breaker* - Unnerve an opponent to the point of them being afraid to strike you. If an enemy attack connects from here on out, flip a coin. Flipping heads will result in that attack coming out in an unstable fashion due to a lingering sense of hopelessness. Roll 1d6 to determine how much damage is lost.
4: *Chrono Stagger* - The flow of time around the target is distorted within your favor. Dice threshold to parry/block attacks permanently reduced by making avoiding damage altogether easier.
5: *Fated Counter* - If the enemy rolls a *Critical!*, flip the dice to act as though it was a critical failure - counterattack will deal double damage and potentially proc the Mirage Assault Broach ***even if the attack used cannot normally activate it.*** This effect will work only once.
6: **Virtuous Strike!!** - The Critical Strike deals 4x damage and applies bleeding guaranteed. If opponent is already bleeding, it upgrades into *Soul Hemorrhage*, bleeding for an additional 5/round, meaning 10/round. From here, flip a coin. If Heads, then this roll will convert the dice into a D6 Exploding. Roll an additional effect - ***including the possibility to reroll a six.***
- *Chapter Seven*, **Form Shift**:  ***Draco Trance*** - Call upon the draconic blood within. A full list of skills is viewable here. [Embrace your bonds.](https://rentry.co/hfioc)
