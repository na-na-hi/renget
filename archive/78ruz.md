Y'know, when I first became a Pokémon trainer at the age of ten, my thoughts of where I'd end up were pretty pure. Ten more years down the line, I never would've thought I'd find myself in my current position. Standing completely naked on top of Sky Pillar in front of a deity many thought didn't even exist. Life sure is crazy. 

"Hmm... yours is much smaller than mine. Why is that?" 

I swallowed, still mostly focusing on just how huge my partners length was, or should I say lengths. He had two, both equally intimidating. 

"Probably has something to do with how you're a fucking twenty-foot tall snake thing, if I had to make a guess." I responded, still too nervous to speak calmly. 

"Still, to have such a disparity between us can't be good, I imagine. I wouldn't blame you if you decided not to go along with this. It's completely up to you" 

I mulled over his words in my mind for a while. Was this even worth it? What would I really gain from this? It wasn't like this was a wacky experience I could tell my friends about for a good laugh, they'd probably think I was crazy. 

"Oh yeah, so basically this one time I befriended a legendary Pokémon and we ended up fucking because he was curious about it. Isn't that crazy?" Ughh, it sounded even weirder when you put it into a sentence. 

But even then, I didn't want to say no because… Well, I was curious too. 

"Is everything okay?" I snapped back to reality, my gaze returning to the serpent-like figure in front of me.

"Yeah, everything's fine. I can work with this, just uh, give me some time to think of something first?" 

"Of course, take your time." He spoke. Well, not really 'spoke' as in the traditional sense. Rayquaza was a Pokémon, so he couldn't speak with his mouth, but since he was a legendary, he could just do it telepathically. 

It took a while to get used to since because I wasn't listening with my ears. The voice would just appear in my head, which made things very disorienting at times. It was still speech though, which I welcomed greatly since it made this whole situation easier to cope with. 

I wasn't a pokephile. At least, that's what I liked to tell myself. I mean yeah, I watched Pokemon fuck in my spare time, but to actually fuck one? That was a whole different story. The main thing that spurred me away was the fact that Pokémon couldn't talk, so how could you say if something was going wrong?

But Rayquaza could talk. And not only that, but I didn't treat him as a Pokemon either. He wasn't in a Pokeball, I didn't give him Pokefood, and I didn't train him to do anything. In fact, if I just described the type of things we did together, you'd probably just think he was a really big dude or something. 

So when he said, out of nowhere, he wanted to see what sex felt like, it was hard for me to just say no outright. Especially since the thought of being a one-million old virgin sounded pretty sad. 

And... I couldn't deny I wasn't attracted to him. His smooth, green scales, piercing golden eyes, and low commanding voice all made him someone I wouldn't even mind taking that step with. 

I said yes, and told him I'd be back tomorrow. So I ended up scaling Sky Tower without any of my Pokémon on me, since I didn't want any of them popping out for food and instead being greeted by... well, not food, that's for sure. 

"Okay, how about this." I said, clapping my hands together to get his attention. "You just do what you want and we'll take it from there. Sound good?" 

He nodded. "That's fine. I assume you'll tell me if I ever go too far?" 

"Yeah, sure." I replied, stepping back as he began to hover forward. His long body slowly coiled to the ground as he tried to reach eye-level with me. 

I stood still, waiting for his first move. It was obvious he was a bit nervous, considering he didn't even know where to begin. Every time he was about to move his claws, he clenched them and pulled them back. I wanted to tell him he could start anywhere, but seeing the Lord of The Skies act so fidgety was honestly pretty cute. 

Eventually however, he made his first move. And wouldn't you know it, he went right for my dick. 

Scales were way different from human skin, I couldn't tell if I liked it better or worse. It did still feel good though. So good that I couldn't help but let out a small moan from my lips. Rayquaza immediately took note of this, grinning just enough that I could see some of his sharp fangs from the side of his mouth. 

"Sensitive." He said, more as a fact then an attempt at teasing. 

He seemed to take my pleasure as a sign of doing something right, and placed my member in the firm but gentle grip of his claws. I'd never gotten a hand job from someone with only three fingers before. He was a bit clumsy about it, but I still enjoyed it, if only because of how different it felt. 

He continued stroking, and before I even knew it myself, I was hard, and already beginning to leak. 

"Hmmm, so it happens to you as well." He said, staring directly at my hardened length with mild curiosity. "We're a bit more alike than I thought." 

"Yeah..." I replied, absentmindedly. Seeing him look at my pre with such interest gave me an idea. A gross idea, but something I wanted to see nonetheless. But I couldn't just outright say it, so I had to hint at it to maybe goad him into doing what I wanted.

"So uh... when you leak, what does it taste like?" He looked at me, his bright, golden eyes now only showed confusion. 

"I wouldn't know, I've never tasted it before. Why?" 

I scrambled my mind frantically for an excuse to use. "Oh! Well, I was just wondering cause... I've heard it tastes good sometimes? I mean, I wouldn't know either, no ones ever really told me about mine, I was just putting it out there." 

Rayquaza was still for a moment, before reaching down to my member, and collecting most of my pre onto one of his claws. I tried to act like it wasn't the most arousing thing I've ever seen in my life when he placed his claw into his mouth and began tasting. 

"Mm…" He let out, furrowing his eyes. 

"How's it taste?" 

"Bitter." He replied. Although, he still swallowed which I found strange, but I paid it no mind. I knew now that the 'foreplay' was over, it came down the main event, which was to fuck the King of the Skies himself, and hopefully make it enjoyable for him. 

I gulped, trying to scrounge up any bit of confidence I had, and surged forward, immediately taking hold of both of the large beasts members in each of my hands. 

"Oh... If you were so eager to start, you should've just said so..." he replied, and I swear he was smug about it. Still, I ignored that too, because I honestly had no idea where to even start with him. 

First of all, both of his dicks were huge, they were about half the size of my entire body. No way I was fitting one in me unless I turned myself into a human condom. 

Second, they were heavy as hell. In order to be able to even start stroking one of them with both my hands I had to sling the other one across my shoulder. It was the most interesting hand job I've ever given, to say the least. 

"Do you uh... Do you like this? What I'm doing right now I mean." I asked, feeling a little worried since he didn't say anything since I began.

He nods. "Yes, It feels very different when someone else touches me." He then began shifting again, coiling himself so that his upper-body was right behind me and his arms were placed around my midsection. "Please, continue." 

The whole thing began to feel steadily more intimate. I got a bit faster and the Sky-God himself began periodically praising me as time went on by dropping words like "Good" and "That's nice" into my head. 

In time, he finally began to leak. I let out a breath of relief, since that meant he was actually enjoying it, and I wasn't just me doing it for nothing. I could probably just keep stroking and bring him to climax just like this, but that would be boring, and also take forever. I needed to do something interesting. No way I was walking out of sex with a god with only handie. 
I ran my hands down his length, all the way down to his base, where his slit was. I paused for a moment, before slipping some fingers inside. 
Immediately, I felt my whole body move as the Sky God nearly trembled from my touch, letting out a hissing sound. 

"On shit, sorry. Did it hurt?"

"No, it was good, just… Intense. It seems I'm very sensitive there." An idea then crossed my mind. 

I let go of his enormous member and pointed to one of the flatter parts of the stone floor. 

"Can you lay down? I wanna try something. I promise it'll feel good. For the both of us."

He followed my directions, and laid his huge frame down onto the floor, face-up. I wasted no time in climbing up on his body, and straddling myself on his snake-like form. 
"What do you plan on doing down there?" He asked, craning his neck to look at me. 

"Don't worry about it. Just know I'm about to rock your world in a couple minutes." I answered, proudly. I least I thought I was. Hopefully my plan worked out and I wouldn't end up looking like an idiot in front of someone who's opinion actually mattered to me. 

I grabbed one of his cocks and threw it over my shoulder like before. Mostly just because the weight felt nice. 

After that, I aligned my shaft, and thrusted it right into his slit. The response was more than satisfactory. 
I knew I was doing something right the second I heard a moan instead of words of praise, because it meant that he was in such bliss, he couldn't even make the effort to use telepathy. Nice.

I thrusted forward again, earning another scream from the Sky God. I watched as he had even begun to start raking his claws against the floor, leaving deep marks in the stone. Man, he must've been insanely sensitive there. 

Makes sense though, if he wasn't messing with it for as long as he said he was, no wonder he was gonna feel like this. 

I made me feel good as well, and I'm not just talking about his slit, which, while it did feel tight as hell and warm as a furnace, couldn't even come close to the power trip I was feeling. 

I had one of the strongest beings in the world under my fingertips, moaning and screaming like no tomorrow, it was incredible! At least... As long as he played along. He could still crush me if he wanted really wanted to, but he wasn't, and it definitely wasn't hurting anyone to let me enjoy this for as long as it was going to last. 

I could tell he was getting close to release from the amount of pre that was leaking from both his members. He just needed a little push to get there, and looking back, I think I found it. 

I reached back, still thrusting as hard I could, and began to tease his tailhole. Due to his size, it was still a pretty big, even if it had never been 'used' before. I let myself get taken away in the passion of the moment, and plunged my hand into it as far as it could go. 

I assume I must have gotten insanely lucky and found his prostate almost immediately, since in the next moment, the Sky God had screamed and began letting loose rope after rope of his hot seed. Thankfully both his members were pointed away from me, so I didn't get drenched. Rayquaza himself wasn't so lucky, and his green scales quickly became coated in his own load. 

I climbed off him and walked over to his face. He was out of breath, his long tongue was lolled out of his mouth, and when he stared at me, he gave me a goofy looking smile, giving me a full display of his sharp teeth. I couldn't help but find that smile ridiculously attractive. Maybe it had something to do with the fact that I just fucked him a moment prior, who knows. 

When he looked down, and noticed that he had basically blanketed the floor of his own home (and himself) with his seed, he let out a long, tired sigh. 

"What a mess…" 

---------  --------- ---------- ---------- ---------- -----------

Rayquaza had flown down from the tower to go clean himself off. I put my clothes back on and waited for him to return.  By the time he came back, the moon was out, and it was about time for me to get home. I waved to the Sky God, and headed towards the stairs. 

"Why so early today? You usually go when the moon reaches the center of the sky." 

I explained to him that I hadn't brought any of my Pokémon with me today. When I was done, all I got was a hard stare, and a bonk on the head. 
 
"Ow! The hell was that for?" I exclaimed, rubbing my head with my hands to soothe my pain. 

"That's for being stupid, and reckless. We could've done this somewhere else if you didn't want to bring any of your friends with you. This tower is still incredibly dangerous you know!" He brings a claw to his temple and shakes his head. To this day I still don't know where he picked that very human mannerism. 

"Oh well, I guess you'll just have to sleep with me up here then." He replied bluntly. 

"What? Sleep where? There's no bed, there's no blankets, there's no pillows! Where the hell am I gonna find a place to sle-"

Before I could finish my rant, Rayquaza had coiled around me, and in the blink of an eye I was all wrapped in the warm scales of Sky God. I wanted to protest, since this was basically kidnapping, but it felt way too good to even make the effort. 

So I layed there, so wonderfully comfortable wrapped in his warm coils I could almost forget about everything else for a moment. The only thing on my mind was him, and our relationship. Could I even call it that? What even was our relationship? It definitely wasn't one that a trainer had with his Pokemon. It was something closer then that. I mean, I visited him on regular intervals and sometimes he would visit me. I would bring him food on some days, and others we would just relax with each other. It's funny, actually. When I said all those things together it almost sounded like we were... Oh shit. 

"Are we boyfriends?" I blurted out, immediately covering my mouth, hoping he wouldn't hear the question. I didn't want to make anything weird between us. Rayquaza was a legendary, so he probably had tons of important things to do. I didn't want to make it seem like he had to pay attention to me on top of that. 

As soon as I felt his slender body begin to shift and move from under me, my heart started to race. He looked at me, his golden eyes near expressionless.

"What's a boyfriend?" 

I almost couldn't keep in my laughter. He didn't even know what a boyfriend was. What a dummy. 
"Nothing, I'll tell you later." I replied, closing my eyes and sinking myself into his coils once again.

"Why even bring it up if you're not going to tell me..." he grumbled, closing his eyes and drifting off to sleep. 

Thoughts of a domestic life with the sky guardian rushed through my mind, before I followed suit and dozed off.
