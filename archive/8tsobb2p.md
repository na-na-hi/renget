>Natsuo Uchiha
"An Uchiha? Oh well, all that past stuff is none of my business. He's less stuffy than I figured he'd be, but I don't get how he can nap all the time! There's so much to do!"

>D
"Ugh, what a jerk! If he thinks he can get away with talking like that, then he's got another thing coming! And what's so good about lightning anyway? Water's way more useful."

>Himari Miko
"Another medical-nin! She's a bit icy, but I hope we can get along after the exam! Er, except for when her teammate is being a jerk. I don't get how she puts up with him."

>Takeru Suzuki
"He seems fun! I bet he's WAY faster than that jerk."

!!! danger Team 2

>Osmau
"He's Kichōna's dad, right? He seems really dedicated to her! Maybe a little too much? He seems a little creepy, but I don't think he's a bad person. He did act weird when he realized I was a Chinkoike...but I'm sure it's nothing. He's one of those really smart guys and they're always curious about stuff. I'm sure his wife is lucky to have such a kind husband!"

>Shimabukuro Fumio
"Woah! I didn't know Genin could be so old! Uh, not that it's a bad thing! It's totally cool that he's still trying! You're only a loser if you give up!"

>Kichōna
"She's nice! A little awkward, but she makes up for it with enthusiasm. She does seem a little, uh, 'off'? Maybe it runs in the family?"

>Nodao-Douji
"How do I put this? She reminds me of Big Sis. Not in a good way. I still think we could get along, but she doesn't seem to like me much. Maybe if I could get my hands on some of the drinks made back home... Well, not like I can do that right now."

!!! danger Team 3

>Kamiko
"She's SO cool! She's super nice and super pretty and she's even friends with a beast! I think she worries a little too much, but I guess someone has to. I'll just try not to give her anymore to worry about! 

>Masu
"*Sigh*. I think she's scared of me. But what did I do wrong? She disappears whenever I look her way! Oh, I hope she didn't hear any of those nasty rumors... There's no way I'd brainwash someone! Well, maybe if they were a real jerk, but I definitely wouldn't do it to a friend! And if she won't give me the chance to talk, then I'll just have to prove it with action. Get ready for an all-out friendship attack!

>Kita
"He's pretty shy, but that's fine as long as he doesn't stop running away from me too. Masu seems to like him, so maybe I should try acting like him. But then who's gonna do the talking? We'd just be staring while doing whatever Kamiko-sensei says, and you can't become friends like that. Maybe he could teach me how to sneak around like he does? Then I might be able to catch Masu off-guard!"

!!! danger Team 4

>Kiko Inuzuka
"She seems a little slow for a Jonin? I guess it's fine as long as she's strong. Anyway, her dog sure is fluffy! He must be super well-trained! I wonder what kind of tricks he can do?"

>Remilia Orochimaru
"She seems sweet and the way she talks is really cute! It's too bad we're on separate teams, but I guess it'd be pretty dumb to put all the medical-nin together. I hope she won't be too upset when I  become the best first!"

>Itami Nanae
"He's sorta stuck up, but he's not too mean about it. He dresses all fancy so he must be from some important clan. I heard he's also pretty fast too... Oh man, I hope they aren't gonna make us race during the exam!"

>Kazen Uzumaki
"He seems...serious. Losing your home is awful, so I guess I get it. I hope his team can help him loosen up."

>Ezaki Tuto

>Jin Hyuga
"He, uh, *definitely* doesn't like me. We haven't talked, but I think I can guess why... Oh, whatever! What does he know? If it's useful then I can't just blow it off."

>Shinrō Kamotai
"Ugh, he'd be okay if didn't have the same attitude as that Hyuga jerk. I feel like there's gotta be something against monks becoming shinobi..."

>Yuma Kouda
"Is this whole team full of jerks!? She talks a lot about how strong she is, but at least she doesn't rap. I feel a little bad for her teammates."

!!! danger Team 6

>Tsugumi
"Ugh, I'm a little dizzy. She just kept talking and talking, and I tried to listen but I just couldn't keep up! She seemed nice, so I hope she doesn't think I was being rude on purpose!"

>Ghidorah
"That mask can't help with making friends. I guess that all that poison can't either. Or the bugs. Uh, well the crocodile is pretty cool! And if he ever needs a friend who doesn't mind all that stuff, I'm happy to help!"

>Junki Takenaga
"I've always loved playing in the forest! I think he should try doing it with some friends, though. I mean, birds are nice! I love birds! But they usually fly away if get too close... Maybe he could show me how to not scare them away?"

>Sen Yamamoto
"She seems pretty smart and *super* good at sensing, but isn't she a little sensitive? I don't really think it's bad — Sensei is like that too. I guess I'm just a bit worried because she doesn't seem that strong either. Oh, I'm gonna feel awful if I have to fight her!"

!!! danger Team 7

>Fujiwara Nobutake
"Is he supposed to be here? I mean, it's great that he is! I just thought samurai didn't like getting involved with shinobi business... Actually, do they have an exam in the Land of Iron? Would they let me take it?"

>Kamare Hozuki
"I don't know anyone couldn't be pumped about the exam! Even if he doesn't care, his team is counting on him! How can he be okay with not giving his all for them? I'd feel AWFUL if I let Masu and Kita down! I might not even be able to eat any Granny's manju for a week!."

>Daiki Ueno
"He seems really smart, but also really sad. I guess dealing with bodies is probably rougher than dealing with sick people... Oh, I think I heard something about him having a condition, so that can't help. If it was me, don't think I'd care about the exam, but it's good he hasn't given up!"
