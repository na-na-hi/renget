#Ride Along
The girls stood up from their booth at Taco Bell. 
"Never thought I'd eat here face to face with you guys." Fauna giggled.
"Yeah, I'm having a lot of fun." Kronii said.
"Would you say you're coming out of your... shell?" Ina said, gesturing to a mostly-eaten taco shell. Kronii shoved her playfully.
Mumei checked her watch. "We might want to hurry. We need to get things properly set up back at the room."
The girls all murmured in agreement.
"Alright, well, let's all go then." Ame said.
The five girls continued their animated conversations as they exited the restaurant. Ame entered the driver's seat, Fauna sat up front in the passenger seat, Kronii behind Ame, Mumei behind Fauna and Ina in the middle of the backseat. The four girls situated properly, Ame put the car into gear. As she began to back out, she began to feel a pain in her stomach. The food was immediately wreaking havoc on her insides. Ame was completely disoriented, and even started to feel a little carsick from the feeling.
"Ame?" Fauna said, nudging her. "You missed the turn. Ame? Hey Ame!"
Ame snapped out of her concentration. "Oh! Uh, sorry about that." Ame said sheepishly and started looking for a place to turn around. As she was looking, she couldn't hold back and let out a small *hic*.
"And there it is." Kronii said. "The renowned hic. I was wondering when we'd hear it in person."
"Ah, you know." Ame laughed sheepishly. "I've been known to-" Ame had to stop talking. The gas building up in her tummy had become overwhelming. She could feel it fighting its way through both ends. This time, she could nto conceal her gas as a hiccup. It all came out at once as a mighty belch. Ame covered her mouth and her eyes darted to Fauna in the passenger seat beside her.
The other four girls did their best to keep themselves from laughing, but they were clearly amused by Ame's inadvertent emission. Fauna managed to keep a straight enough face, and asked "Hey, Ame do you need to take a break? Maybe we don't need to hurry after all."
"I'm fine. Don't worry about me so much!" Ame said. Her face was beginning to get pink as she tried to distract herself with the drive. Maybe if she cleared her head of all thoughts, she would be able to suppress the gas. 
She was wrong.
The gas that had been forcing its way through her intestines was finally at its breaking point. No matter how hard she clenched, there was no hope of preventing it. She grunted under her breath involuntarily. Her seat rumbled and vibrated, as a muffled "PRRRTTTTT" echoed throughout the cramped vehicle. The stench was quick to follow, the pungent stench of digested taco bell immediately saturating the entire car. Kronii was the first to be affected, she scrunched up her nose and winced. Ina leaned away, looking out the window. Mumei pulled her mantle up to her face and covered her nose with it, trying to isolate herself with her own stench. 
"Uuu..." Fauna made a noise as the smell wafted over to her.
"Hey, uh, do you mind if I open the windows...?" Kronii said, awkwardly.
Ame had gone from pink to beet red. The shame and embarrassment overcame her as she began to sink lower in her driver's seat. The question did demand an answer, however. "Oh... um, I've got some bad news." Ame's voice was shaky in her shame. "The windows don't really work on this car... I mean, you're welcome to try but..."
Fauna, Mumei and Kronii all tried to open their windows to confirm this, to no avail.
"Well that's... peachy." Kronii said.
PRRRTTTTTTssssshh. Another loud fart, this time much, much wetter sounding, rocked the car. The smell was even more rancid this time, mixing in with the previous fart that they had already started hotboxing in. Mumei's eyes started to get teary from the stench. Ame audibly groaned in embarrassment. 
"I'm really sorry, guys." Ame said, in a small voice.
"Taco bell, you know. Am I right? We can all relate." Ina said, trying to inject levity. 
"Yeah, it's fine." Kronii said, diplomatically. 
"You know maybe we should pull over. Take a bathroom break or something?" Fauna suggested again.
"Y-yeah maybe... maybe we should." Ame said, dying inside. She immediately looked for the first place to pull off.
A lighter fart made its way out, as Ame made a small "nnn" noise. She wanted to cover her face, but with her hands on the wheel, she couldn't exactly do that. 
*urp*. Ame burped again. This time, nobody looked like they wanted to laugh. Instead, they were trying their best not to breathe in too many of Ame's ass fumes.
"I think I see a place up there." Fauna said, gesturing helpfully.
It was a public bathroom. Ame pulled over as soon as she reached it. She opened up the car door and stepped out. The other girls all let their doors open as well to try and let the stink escape. Ame turned to look at the others. "I'll be right..." a smaller, quicker fart came out of her, making her cringe at herself. "...back."
Ame ran to the bathroom, holding her tummy.
