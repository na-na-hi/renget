Name: Evalyn Wong
Face: Evalyn switches between looking quite zen or looking very gloomy, but in general always looks kind of melancholic. One of her more distinguishing traits is a mole under her left eye.
Hair: Black hair worn in a bob with bangs that usually cover her right eye.
Eyes: Dark Brown.
Height: Real short.
Bodytype: Svelte, curvier than she presents herself.
Complexion: Clear aside from the mole under her left eye.
Uniform Variation: Inconsistent based on her belongings including clothing often being stolen and hidden from her.
Voice: Thick Chinese accent, rarely speaks as a result.
Body Language: Is very still when interacting with people, keeps direct eye contact and is generally calm/stoic.
Social: Friendless loser who is easily missed and has a severe lack of presence.
Visibility: As background as background gets.
Quirks: Very small, calligraphy-like handwriting and prone to saying hopeful proverbs instead of actual communication.
Things you wouldn't do: Has no understanding of romantic gestures and herself will never be flirtatious intentionally. Doesn't necessarily avoid people so much as she just isn't very interactive. Rarely if ever breaks her calm, and when she does it's because she's getting gloomier than usual. Will never waste food; ever.
Animals: Loves animals of all shapes and sizes, has no desire to be an animagus but finds them interesting.
Misc: Real skilled in wushu, often leaves inspirational messages on billboards, a pretty big pushover who is easy to turn into someone's gopher and a skilled enough healer that people sometimes seek her out for medical attention or folk remedies from the orient.
