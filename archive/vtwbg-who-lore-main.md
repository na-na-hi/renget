##Basic Overview
On a vast range of multiple climates and elevations, the young republic had to fight since its very beginning to earn its place, it's militarization was swift, and its forts plentiful, although in the present time, most of these defenses are relaxed.
The military currently employs a system of mass conscription and an extreme love for artillery, this in addition to the multiple forts and weapon caches of the nation dictates a doctrine for sieges and attrition warfare, however, the military is still prepared and suited for the occasions in which it needs to go on offensive warfare. The Navy is of relatively small size and mainly a merchant one, with a focus on raiding and interception of potential enemies in war times, when not in war it dedicates itself to the protection of shipping.
The republic's system of beliefs states that the development of the human species gave rise to the creation of a being that represents it, the more humanity grows, the stronger this being will get. This has led to a cult of technology and a love for historical investigation across many of the scholars of the republic. The current technological focus is on the possibility of vehicles that could travel across the skies and their use as weaponry nicknamed "the Pixy project"

It holds a large and growing population from many diverse origins, this does cause occasional friction between groups about any multitude of topics. The most noteworthy of these were the "Odin drinks cum" and the "Hand proportions" arguments.
The population mainly subsists on potato farming and meat, these potatoes are then exported into the wider world economy, self-sufficient production of machine parts for more specialized products (in particular, weaponry and farming equipment) exists. In addition to previously mentioned economic activities, there is a tradition to gather pitches from the marshes to be made into boiling tar, its main use is for torture.
Its inhabitants use clothes from multiple eras, from ancient clothes to the most modern styles, but the standard uniform for state workers is a paper bag over the face and a brown cloak that covers the body, those that live in the republic will most often also wear some sort of face cover, even if it's not a paper bag.
Generally, the population is warm to tourists, but there are high standards to citizenship that everyone is expected to follow

The republic maintains very good relationships with the mountain monks of /rrat/ and the citizens of Watson, and will often reach out to other places in search of healthy alliances, although most of these attempts tend to be cut short by lack of interest by either party or by logistical constraints.
>**Interactions with sister splits**
>Small trading relationship with /nasa/ but logistics are difficult due to terrain, there exists a desire to eat the bread dogs on /who/'s side.
>Ocassional trips into /uuu/ forest to collect material, but other than that the roads are blocked due to saplings not wanting human entry.
>Cold to nonexistent relations with /infinity/, no hostilities are in sight.
>Mountain monks of /rrat/ occasionally make trips into /who/ to maintain relations, there is a large amount of trade and they are well-liked.

Among it's more troubling groups is the cannibal cult, which states that the nameless being that is worshipped by the republic is in fact a cannibal and thus they must honor it by the cannibalization of the enemies of the republic, they are kept under quiet surveillance by the security forces and often told to keep themselves from being too open about it as not many want to entertain them or their dangerous ideas. 

!!! note **The Trajetory of the Republic?**

## Coat of Arms
-> ![Lesser Coat of Arms of the Owl Republic](https://files.catbox.moe/smkazd.png) <-
->[Full size](https://files.catbox.moe/k7gl7e.png)<-

The Lesser Coat of Arms of the Owl Republic, the most commonly used and found version in the country. A more elaborate Greater version with elements such as supports and a motto exists, but it's usually reserved for things like important documents and as decoration during state functions.

The different elements in the escutcheon represent:
- Book: Knowledge, Wisdom, Tradition and Reason
- Waterwheel: Industry, Technology, Human ingenuity and Progress
- Fortress: Security, Honor, Steadfastness and Memory of the Founding War
- Cauldron: Justice and Community
The inescutcheon in the middle consists of the Nameless One's Crest, which placed within the context of the overall design represents the guidance the Nameless One gives in these aspects of the country.

## Religion
The Republic does not hold an official religious policy to spread and is in fact, rather close to an atheist state, this is not due to a lack of deities thought, but due to a large amount of often conflicting beliefs by much of the population and the lack of material and text detailing the origin of the stories.
The Republic often steps in fights between the groups and forces them to make peace, it's in part thanks to this that the Republic is so centralized.

These beliefs do tend to have the following features in common:
1. They speak about a nameless being
2. This being is related to humanity in some way
3. This being is typically represented as a woman
4. This being is not a god

Owl Belief is not an actual religious belief, but of the commonplace relation that Owls, specifically Eagle-Owls, receive to the Nameless being.
Polytheism isn't unheard of, especially after 2-way communications had been established with the sister nation of the Mountain monks to the east and references to each other mythology had been found, current talks with the explorers from outside the planet have yielded interesting propositions about the religious belief of all our nations. References to the religion of the mountain monks and their deity, a being of chaos that is surprisingly level-headed are most numerous. The fact that the Mountain Monks hold the most unified religion aside from the far eastern islanders of /infinity/ probably influenced this. the Druids of the northern forest also hold a system of beliefs that references that of the other sister nations, but due to logistical constraints and the shifting paths of the forest, it is hard to investigate.

Many groups claim that she is formed by the collective power and intelligence of every human in existence, she is humanity itself. Others, however, claim that she is a reflection of humanity instead, some claim that she is civilization's mother, others that she is civilization's daughter.

The Cult of Reason stands among other cults by taking the concept of the "humanity itself" theory and pushing it to its logical extreme, humans must grow in power and knowledge to surpass any enemies and eventually, allow the nameless being to kill the gods that constrain humanity. Many of the Republic's politicians, scientists, and military leaders form part of this cult. This does mean that they are in positions of political power and will often try to push forth scientific investigation, and less known, espionage on other nations and states.

A much more obscure and suppressed Cannibal cult exists, rising independently and before the /meat/ warriors retook the beliefs of the older world, the Cannibal cult is jingoistic and states that the nameless being is a cannibal, she shall cook the gods alive in a boiling pot and eat their soup, the cannibals believe that they must honour her by the cannibalization of the enemies of the Republic. It's members are good at hiding and only occasionally pop up in public space, despite their jingoism, they still respect the Republic's diplomatic strategy and contain themselves and their beliefs.

Notably, many of these groups never detail whether or not an afterlife exists, and most outright deny it

### Pantheon
![pantheon](https://files.catbox.moe/7svuzy.png)

**>Notes:**
>It's the basic structure of the pantheon and it's common interpretation by the Republic, it's basically suposed to represent a bunch of combined legends, myths, stories, and the like that have been built up from many peoples across the lands.
>Mumei is commonly represented as a Homer/Herodotus type character that travels the earth and records things, this is why she pops out in many stories and myths. She then became the main figure in the religion of the people.
>Ame is meant to be a hero type character with multiple exploits and things like that, still a human thought. I'll change it if /awat/ does not like it.
>Ina has a different type of divinity than the others (because lovecraft), but since /wah/ hasn't made any lore, I won't touch her for now.
>The soulpath is the name for the underworld, where the soul of living beings is taken for ???, I'm not smart enough to come up with an afterlife system, maybe they go back to the land or something. I'm open for suggestions here.

###Religious Organization and Worship
While there is a central religious organisation, the First Temple as it's called, holds no real power over the local temples, even less so the disparate branches of the faith. It serves more as a place for dialogue, debate and cooperation between the different denominations of temples. In a "secular" state, with the Religious mission of maintaining civilisation and spreading progress taken care of by the state, the First Temple also has no political power, its role only ceremonial. In more sinister terms, it's also where the government monitors the religious groups. The First Temple has its own clergy and holds official ceremonies for the state. Each local temple serves as a communal hub for the locals to bond over, but gatherings are not mandatory and very casual. Gatherings are usually held during a set day(usually at the weekend) or a festival. The priests are less moral arbiters like some other countries with strict religious hierarchy, and more the glue and lubricant that helps the community stay together. That role is left to religious scholars, politicians and the citizens themselves. Regarded as a kind of specialist and professional, their role is public and not separated from the ordinary citizens. They may help resolve any small conflicts that are not worth taking to the law, head funerals or organise local festivities(almost always with the help of the local administration).

Like many other nations that worship female deities, female clergy members are highly regarded. Female clergy outnumbers male clergy in the country. Clergy members, much like the casual nature of the worship, also do not wear religious clothing like robes and veils as they are reserved for ceremonial use unless it's a rule for their particular congregation. The organisation and avenues of advancements in the different congregations vary wildly just like their belives and practices, so it's not worth listing them all. But some very small temples without links to any bigger organisations would just take in orphans or willing youth to train them as the next generation of priests.

Prayers are generally done by making a Sign of the Owl and placing it in front of one's chest, the back of the hand facing out. The palms are straightened, fingers slightly spread out and one palm placed in front of the other(based of the front palm should touch the wrist of the backhand). With thumbs bending slightly backwards with the mid sections touching, forming two feathers or horns. It's also used as a formal greeting together with a gentle bow. Another religious hand sign is the "Defensive Mode". The pointer is raised slightly with the base of the thumbs half folded towards the centre of the palm. The hands are formed as a slight cup and then crossed at the wrist with the back of the thumbs facing outward. This hand gesture has many applications. It's used in a wide array of contexts, for example, when one wants to invoke spiritual protection during stressful situations and as sort of a sign of provocation, signalling firm confidence.

###Religious Celebrations and Pratices
There are generally three kinds of festivals in the Owl Republic. National, public holidays such as the National day on the 22nd of August. Regional holidays such as the Seeding Festivals, celebrated in the agricultural belt of the Republic, typically in late November after all the planting has been completed. A more unique type of festivals are the celebration of a new divination. While oracles and prophecies are a common practice to receive divination and connect with the Heavenly realm across the world, the Republic has its own distinctive customs. Notably, due to material shortages during its initial founding, Hopium, which was once abundant (overly so) in the country was commonly used to conduct the ritual by priests. But differing from the contemporary ritual, only Hopium is used instead of a complex concoction of chuubanite and various herbs. Due to this, and the lack of regulation led to many inaccurate or downright false divination. Now, only Oracles, high-ranking clergy members conduct such rituals and divination obtained with only Hopium are not treated seriously. Once an Oracle was able to connect with the Heavenly realm and receive the Sacred words from the Nameless One, other priests would rush out of the Temple, yelling the phrase "It's time".

After the divinations ended, the result would be gathered and cross-referenced with those received by other Oracles. The verified content would be published in the myriad newspapers in the Republic, or more immediately announced by a crier outside of temples. Celebrations of such divinations can last for weeks. Though they are not like public holidays, where most production and work pauses. The celebration is localized to temples and the districts surrounding it. Impromptu markets and stages are set up with troupes performing to entertain any visitors wishing to read the full text written by the Oracles. Public games like soccer are often held during the celebration too.

###Cult of Reason

Many figures in the Republic, be it political, scientific, or in other areas of importance, have recently taken a liking to the Cult of reason, while it is called a cult, it is more of an intellectual movement.
This "movement" originated from a combination of the temples embracement of humanist rethoric and various researchers of multiple fields getting together in coffee shops to discuss their findings, while the temples have no political influence, they have plenty of cultural one, and many researchers based themselves off this existing culture of belief in the human being to find ways to improve upon their work and society.
The movement itself discusses certain ideas, the main one being that of "Cultural, technological, and human advancement", where those involved will often discuss how to best forward their ideas to such a goal. Often think tanks and large reunions are planned in universities, coffee shops, temples, and wherever it is seen as a good idea to do so. Nationalist ideas, while commonly floated around, are not a main point of the movement, as it is a humanist one. Efforts to combine nationalism and humanism have been mildly recepted.

The temples often have a variety of opinions on the Cult of reason, while some temples, mainly those that prefer the peaceful development of the Republic, argue that it takes away from actual worship of the true religion, other temples are much more involved and highly support the movement, linking together both the stories and myths of the common religion to the goals of the Cult of reason. As a result, temple leaders tipically get completed educations in a variety of subject in order to better host the movement.
Many of the military, political, and economic class support the movement, and the working class is receptive to the ideas proposed by the Cult of reason.
The impact on the arts has been interesting, with many artists choosing to represent humanity and a variety of animals with their own ideas of progress. A famous painting is by an eccentric artist who instead imagined the potential horrors by painting a citizen sitting alone on the moon. The use of sharp lines, pencils, and gradients is common in this new movement, but it is still being changed by many of the artists involved.
International scholars and researchers are also ocassionally invited, thought, due to the waryness the government has towards foreign governments and the RID's care for the mantainance of technological secrecy in important sectors, it is quite a bit difficult for some belonging to more neutral contries.

Currently, there is tought about formalizing the Cult of reason and its reunions into a more official seminar hosted by the university and a variety of temples.

### Funeral Rites
Whenever someone dies, the subjects will is to be examined for any special requests and it will be decided which are possible and which are not. Often people will put in light jokes and small petty requests as a form of humor to be found after their untimely demise, the most common of these is the "Boot to the head" treatment. If no will can be found, then the death of the subject will be dealt by the spouse or a familiar of the subject, the priority list will give the spouse rights over the funeral first, then the siblings, then the parents, then any other family members.
Bodies are often burried in the backyards of the home or in the state graveyards very unceremoniously, coffins are not used in order to better feed the body to the earth, with grave spots being marked by stones upon which the full name and nickname if there is one, birth-to-death date, and occupation are stated, if the person has done any admirable acts during their life, then it will also be stated under these.
Ceremonies consists of groups of people getting together and drinking beer or other alcoholic bevarages, the last drink is reserved for the dead and it is poured over their burial spot.

If the body is not claimed by anyone, or no one decides to take resposibility of the corpse, then it will be buried by the state in one of the graveyards, as is often the case for deaths in combat or in military service.
Cremations are less common, but when they are done the ashes will tipically be spread across a place of significance for the person.
Criminals or those that have been executed by the state (often by boiling tar) will either be given as soup to those that wish to taste the body, or burried in the state graveyards.
The state requires for everyone to register those that have died and keeps records and logs on them.
Graveyards keepers hold a reputation for unhingedness and dark humors, their bloodied shovels and wide eyes along their imposing figures certainly not helping their reputation, they will walk during the nights and protect the graveyards from wild animals and corpse stealers with a special kind of ferocity.
Corpse stealing used to be an issue due to the need for those in medical institutions to have proper examples, and thus a legal system was put in place to give corpses to medical institutions and centers of learning for the medical doctors to study and teach their students about the human body.

***
####Gravekeepers
So that the people may be able to visit and conmemorate their dead, the nation requires staff that mantain the graveyards, however, an association with death and the stigma that follows made it difficult to obtain a steady flow of volunteers, as a result, the job was taken on by those that have had close experiences with death and are capable of taking the mental stress of such a profession. These people are called: Gravekeepers.

The duty of a gravekeeper is simple, mantain the assigned graveyard and it's functions working, thus, a graveyard is not only a protector, but also a bureaucrat and administrator, as the graveyards have multiple functions, the staff working under a gravekeeper has also expanded to accomodate them.
The graveyard's staff is state appointed, and legally so is the gravekeeper, in practice, the gravekeeper will be selected by another gravekeeper who will train them on graveyard duties, and when the gravekeeper retires it is the trainee who will take on the office, althought, tipically, retired gravekeepers will proceed to live the rest of their lives in the graveyard and act as source of advice whenever needed, and once upon death, be taken to one of the graveyards for unclaimed corpses and be buried there. For all intents and porpouses, trainees are still referred to as gravekeepers.

The undertaker, tipically a professional medic, is tasked with the preparing of the body for burial, along with logging into a record all incoming corpses and the actions done upon them. They tipically burn out from the job relatively soon, and alcoholism is a common problem for those that remain a long time in the profession, so often it is recent graduates that take the job to gain experience or retired medics who feel they are unable to work on living people. Generally their duties include autopsy and analyzing the body for reason of death, then closing the body and leaving it in as natural as shape as is possible, and wrapping it up with paper or cloth for easier burial.
Since the undertaker will ocassionally be unable to meet the requirements of logging everything, dedicated administrators, often medics in training, will also be hired to keep track of everything that happens during the processes. The undertaker and the administrator tipically live outside of the graveyard, live-in residencies are uncommon for them.

That will tipically make up the entire staff of a graveyard, as the gravekeeper is mainly tasked with digging graves, doing the burials or observing them depending on whether the responsible family wishes to do it by themselves, and cleaning the stones or burial marks left there. Mantainance of the landscape is left to the gravekeeper as well, so gardeners will ocassionally be hired to remove some of the weeds and to plant flowers around.
While the graveyard keeper can hire as much staff as needed to aid in duties, it will remain low as working with the dead is a very stressful affair and doing it for long comes with social stigma.
Graveyards are state owned, meaning that gravekeepers are technically state officials, and managed by the state administration, for this reason, the gravekeepers are given special legal status to accomplish their duties, with certain restrictions placed upon them to stop them from ammasing too much power, that combined with the often questionable past from many of the gravekeepers means that they will tipically not use their legal authority much.
Among these authorities are:
- Ability to resolve legal battles if summoned by both parties or the state
- Monopoly of violence in graveyards
- Write fines
- Do arrests
- Destruction of plagues (dubios legal definition, applies to more things than you'd think) if it affects the graveyard

While the gravekeeper does not have the right to kill humans, as it is often mythologized and rumored, they do have the right to harm as long as it is non-vital and non-permanent damage. Wild animals, and living anomalies have no such defence by the law, so gravekeepers are allowed to do hunts against these.
Gravekeepers, aside from protecting the graveyard, and by their association with death, are often hired and asked by local authorities to deal with anomalies and powerful beasts, meaning that they are often "State Anomaly Resolver" by the hobby groups interested in the supernatural.
As of now, wendigos and warfs seem to be their most common extermination target as records tell, however, very few undertakers have been able to confirm their existence due to the damage their bodies will be left to, so it is often left as overgrown wolves and beasts in the records.

Of more interest to other people, is the selection process for new gravekeepers.
Candidates first present themselves either by volunteer and by offer of the state, generally, those that have had close encounters with death, and have dealt with death themselves are looked for and preferred, as such, veteran soldiers that had especially demanding actions, violent criminals in the process of reforming, experienced hunters that are starting to feel remorse, and generally people that have done impressive feats but still suffer from regrets and doubts, such as firefighters or others, are all candidates according to the state.
The state will give a list of candidates to a gravekeeper looking for a new apprentice and replacement, and will go to convince the person of interest, they have a surprisingly high rate of acceptance, as a lot of them struggle with getting jobs due to social stigma already.
While uncommon, it is not unheard of for gravekeepers to recruit multiple trainees depending on the size of the graveyard they must keep, there is no formal hierarchy for multiple gravekeepers working in a single graveyard, so it is often decided by days of rest and days of work on who will represent the graveyard.

##Military

###Army
**{[To Main Army Lore Arvhive](https://rentry.org/urahp)}**

***
### Rations of the army
Around 40% of wheat fields, 35% of grazing fields and 20% of potato farms in the Republic are owned by the State. These centralised, state owned farms are the main source of the army's provisions. Centralisation(at least in theory) yields more food, improves smoothness of logistics and quality controll, even if it has some shortfalls compared to private options, the military still perfers the security and stability over the potential effeicency of private market.
To combat digestion problems related to the monotonous diet of the military, fruit preserves, espically prune plums are supplied to units. Other than the usual prunes there's also pears cooked in wine, candied cherries and wild berry compote.

When a Legion marches, the provisions typically include salted beef, mutton or pork, canned foods(from potatoes & meat, smoked fish to string beans), fruit perserves, bullion cubes, suet/salted pork fat , sacks of wheat flour/potatoes, boxes of hardtacks, sugar, coffee, vodka and other nessities such as candles and soap. Fresh produce(including milk!) are usually provided twice ot thrice a week but that's under ideal circumtances and thus aren't expected to be maintained in wartime. The Republic's provision does not rely on fresh produce to keep its soldiers healthy due to its large canning industry and the logitical ability to distribut them. The various canned food are designed to provide at least the baseline of nutritional needs for months.
When regiments are garrisoned, their weekly provisons also include eggs, various smoked meats and more kinds of fresh produce bought from local farmers.

When encamped, brick ovens are constructed to bake bread for the men. Field kitchens cook big pots of stews or even roasts if fresh meat or cattle is avalible. Energy dense food such as hardtack and canned meat & potatoes are reserved for marches.
Light infantry or other reconnaissance troops perfer bringing canned meat & potatoes, bread, salted pork fat and fruit perserves as they don't require any cooking and thus the need to light fires. Perfect for picket duty. They typically bring 3-4 days worth of rations while marching ahead of the supply trains.
Line infantry usually bring hardtacks, canned food, bread, salted meat and animal fats while on the move. As they march relatively close to the supplies, they would typically only bring 1-2 days worth of food on their person.

Even though the Republic's canned rations are incrediblely varied(there are 23 different varieties excluding perserved fruits), the amount one can bring is limited. Bringing more than 4 cans starts to become cumbersome when combined with all the other equipment one has to carry. As such, soldiers came to learn different recipies to make the less agreeable provisions like hardtacks more edible.

**The Tartarus stew:**
Fatty meat/fat is rendered in a pan. Then Hardtacks are pounded into chunks and added into the rendered fat(if fatty meat is used, it is best to be taken out and added back in later, though many soldiers skip this step). After around 15 minutes, the hardtack became crispy and flavourful. If perfered water and chopped canned vegetables are added in.

**Hardtack pudding:**
Hardtacks are pounded finely and then mixed with water or milk if avalible. While the hardtack is left to sit, fruit perserves are chopped and mixed with sugar and spices if one's lucky enough to have a relative mail it to them. The hardtack mixture is rolled into a crust and used to wrap the fillings. The pudding is then steamed in a pot for up to 2 hours.

**Lobscouse:**
Fatty meat or animal fat is rendered in a pot. Canned vegetables are chopped and if situation allowed, fresh, foraged wild vegtables are used as well.
Meat(either canned or salted) is added and left to brown and hardtacks are pounded into small chucks. The vegetable are then added with bouillon and water. The hardtack chucks are added with some reserved to add crucnch if one perfers. After around 20 minutes the stew is seaoned to taste and ready to serve.

**Army gruel:**
Hardtacks are pounded into small chunks. The pounded hardtacks are added either in a pot of boiling water or left to soakover in a bowl night. If added into pot, around 30 minutes with ocassional stirring is needed. Fruit perserves are chopped and added into the pot/bowl. If avalible, milk is also added when finishing or on top of the bowl. The gruel is then seasoned to taste with sugar or spices.

###Navy
 **Naval Ensign**
->![Naval Ensign of the Republican Navy](https://files.catbox.moe/qgnrtm.png)<-

 **Naval Jack**
->![Naval Jack of the Republican Navy](https://files.catbox.moe/p1w7lo.png)<-

The Republic's strategy and naval doctrine are dictated by the large port that it uses for imports and exports alongside its relatively small coastline in comparison to its neighbours, unable to build up a Navy due to the early wars of the Republic's existence, it is only recently that the naval wing of the armed forces has been established.
Seeing these constraints, the Navy was built up to mainly wage a commerce war, where the ships will be used to interrupt the logistics of the enemy, raid their shipping, and divert the enemy's attention to prevent any blockade from hitting the Republic. Winning every small battle and eventually whittling down the enemy to cripple their naval war capacity while maintaining the integrity of ours.
The ships used are heavy frigates created to pack as much of a punch as they can while still being fast enough to avoid the enemies fighting fleet, in short, increasing the individual strength of every ship to counteract the smaller numbers of the fleet, in addition to all these points, the use of carronades allows the Navy to also increase the firepower of the ships.
The scientific approach to war and other aspects of the world, prompted by the cult of reason gaining so many followers in the political system of the republic, means that despite a lack of experience in naval warfare doctrine development and work on naval theory has sped up immensely. This also means that the Republic is very willing to invest in more experimental affairs and ships, such as the submersible prototypes for coastal defence, the use of iron and steel to protect the ships, and the use of alternate power sources for use on the ships and allowing complete independence from the sail, although most of these have shown themselves to still be too expensive for mass production.

The current alliance with Hoshiyomia, the strongest naval power on the western coast of the continent has also allowed the Navy to gain experience and technique, along with joint development for new naval and astronomical technology.

####The Ensign of the Navy

The Story of the constellation Noctua can be traced back to the Founding of the Republic. The most popular version of the story recounts the mass immigration in the early years of the Republic. How faithful pilgrims from the Eastern Continent, who chose to dedicate themselves to the Nameless One often fell prey to schizos, as the fledging state has yet to reclaim its Western Coast. Under the intense rrat energy, Kizuna Sea can often turn turbulent in the snap of a finger. The storms and fog made many weakened, lost pilgrimage ships easy victims of marauders. Seeing the plight of her Faithfuls, legend has it that the Nameless One shape shifted, flew to the hearth where the Void Mother resides. She pleaded for the Void Mother to save the poor souls who were seeking safe shores. Moved by the Nameless One's pleads, the Void answered, and took a feather from the Nameless One. The feather turned into an owl, that flew in the night skies, pointing the pilgrims to where safe landings are. The stars that guides saved countless lives. However, the Owl eventually tired itself too much. It decided to rest on the tail of the Lady of Time's Hydra, where it resides now. And when the faithful are in great despair or crisis, the legend tells to look at the night skies for the Owl, who may yet fly once again, acting as a guiding light.

In modern times, the constellation became a symbol of nautical safety and guidance. Which the Republican Navy adopted as its Ensign. While underway, Merchant ships registered in the Republic are also required to hang the ensign at their stern.

###Conscription and Enlistment
->![@gyaheung](https://files.catbox.moe/3mueq4.jpg)<-
Any male citizens over the age of 18 who have not achieved an education level higher than the École or obtained the relevant certificate of trade/profession proficiency are subject to conscription. Conscripts are distributed to either the Army or the Navy. Two and a half years of mandatory service means that most hoomans have a big incentive to continue their education or achieve intermediate proficiency in their trade. However, since being honourably discharged comes with benefits and welfare, many sons from poorer households would wait for their ticket or enlist right after École.

Army Drill camp lasts for six weeks, where conscripts are trained in basic combat skills, marching and discipline. After Drill camp, conscripts deemed eligible are sent to regimental reserve units for specialisation training, where they become specialists like sappers or artillery gunners. Specialist training lasts for around one to two months. As these specialists are especially valuable, their service is extended for another two years and their pay is raised compared to the average line infantry. Since enlisting would guarantee a recommendation from the recruiter, making entering specialist corps easier, conscription isn't the only way for the army to recruit. The Republican Military's deep pockets and defensive doctrine mean the average conscript and recruits have great marksmanship, able to train with at least 60 rounds and 80 blanks during their basic training. New recruits for calvary pretty much only include those who had previous riding experience, while the Cuirassiers only accept volunteers and had a longer training period. All personnel are obligated for at least 8 days of training per year after being discharged, except those in militia units that follow their unit's training regime. The Republic invests a huge amount into the training of its soldiers, however, most of the practical skills and most importantly experience still need to be learnt while on the march. 

The Navy however don't have any training school besides an officer's academy. Any new conscripts are initiated as a landsman and trained by senior seamen while onboard their assigned ship. Sailing requires extensive knowledge and experience, as a result, conscripts who became a landsman are required to serve for a minimum of four years. But as the experience gained and the title of able seaman allows for a worthwhile career path in private shipping, the navy is nevertheless popular with hoomans enlistees who grew up on the coasts. Any students who chose to be trained in sailing during École would have a quicker path to becoming a midshipman and eventually a warrant officer. Spurred by patriotism and the handsome rewards, many experienced mariners are on the registry for wartime recruits as well. The mostly volunteer sailor corps of the Navy is one of the reasons for its relative success in combating pirates and raiders despite the young age.

The Republic had a rich history of female citizens taking up arms and defending the country. While women are not subject to conscription, any enlistees are treated the same as their male counterparts with a small exception. With the exception of the Infantry Corps, female volunteers are welcomed by most branches of the Army. However all frontline services have strict physical requirements, arguably more so than male volunteers. As such, enrolling in a military academy or being born on a farm are the most guaranteed bet at obtaining glory on the battlefield, whether by being an officer or a grunt. There are a few mixed units that accommodate female enlistees but officers are much less restricted in the units they can join. The Navy is much more restrictive, almost all shipboard posts are off-limits to women, with civilian positions like surgeon and officers being the exception. Opening up all posts to their female citizens have been considered by the government at multiple times since the army moved to a more volunteer centric system. Although due to a lack of historical precedence and the need for such a measure (the military had been experiencing a slow down-scaling since around the late 10th century), all proposals have been rejected on pragmatic grounds. Even so, opening up more positions for women or even implementing partial conscription for them are known potential strategies for the Republic during crises.

###Fortifications

The hilly terrain of the Republic suits itself incredibly well for defensive maneuvers, as the Republic itself would learn in the wars that made the country. However, one cannot simply count on the terrain to do the job, the building of forts and bunkers, and occasionally improvised defenses is considered an art, and the armed forces of the Republic have certainly taken this lesson to heart.

The first thing many would see when entering the Republic is the coastal defences of the ports. As defense doctrine sustains, it cannot be assumed that the fleet will be present to provide support against an invading enemy, and the Republic's vast artillery arsenal allows for the coastal forts to be plentiful and well maintained, thus, these two realities shape how the coastal defenses have been built.

The most common shape is that of a triangular shape made to face the sea, this will be inclined in such a way as to allow a person to stand on top of it, but hard to climb when in front of it. These constructions, while originally made of a mix of sandstone, limestone, and compacted dirt, have now switched to using concrete. These constructions will be connected to each other through an underground path, and from there, there will be stairs that connect the top floor of the construction with the inside. The battery is placed on top of the triangular fort. Ammunition, along with maintenance equipment is placed inside of the construction. The construction has 2 slots on the part facing the sea, these slots are large enough to fit a standard firearm.

The underground tunnels that connect to the constructions are vulnerable if an enemy jumps in from the construction, so they are made in a way as force chokepoints where small arms fire can be let through freely. And indentations, serving as covers are built into the sides of the walls for ambushes. Explosives can be used to collapse the tunnels if the situation calls for it. A building is used to connect the surface with the constructions by the tunnels, the building is on the city, and houses ammunition and garrisons. The buildings on the surface will be near the coast, and connect with multiple constructions. A construction connected to a building in the surface will only be able to connect to that building, as to force chokepoints.

All military constructions take priority over civil constructions, this means that the military has some say in how the port is built, and will kick out civilians who wish to build on a section they called for. This also means that civilian constructions had to obey certain military requirements for building, and the city has multiple locations that serve as killzones and bunkers if any invaders landed. On the coast, ramparts are built and the constructions will be painted with colors made to hide their position. Bunker personnel is assigned their turns weekly, and they are under the administration of naval command.

While ideas for mass usage of explosives on the port to deprive it from the enemy exist, they have been shelved, as it is most certainly an insane thing to do. More experimental ideas on coastal defense exist, such as floating batteries on the water or mines, but have proved unfeasible due to various constraints. The two places where these fortifications are most used would be the important ports of the Republic, but smaller fortifications exist on river mouths and less patrolled places.

Inland fortifications take a different shape to satisfy the needs of the military. As most enemies have been dealt with for much time, a large number of fortifications have fallen to disuse. Still, so as to keep up with the old nickname of the nation, "The Fortress Republic", the military has plans to reactivate, test out, and rebuild the forts for when a new threat appears in a nearby region. In the modern era, the renaissance of Hoshiyomia has stirred some in the military to proceed with early cautions for the plan.

Most of the abandoned forts are located near the western border with Hoshiyomia, originally built during the multiple wars that happened between multiple emerging countries in the region. They eventually fell to the Republic, and remain very outdated. The most modern forts in the Republic are those that employ steel and concrete, and developments in industrial production have made these relatively easy to build for the Army.
Border forts will generally be built into the ground, larger fortifications inside the country, with smaller bunkers connecting to it proliferating closer to the border, the idea being to bog down the enemy to permit for easier counterstrikes by local military units. The larger constructions made to hold the area are built as Star Forts, although newer tests and a call to modernize the forts have seen them being replaced with what is called Polygonal Forts. While less visually impressive, they have proven to be better against hostile bombardments, while still maximizing that of the fort.

The first forts to be updated are those of the Hoshiyomian border, with the druid forest and the monk mountains being set to be updated later as they lack the mass usage of artillery and firepower that the more modern states have. Forts on the border of the druids have certain key differences, those being made to resist any potential raiding force that settles inside the forest, and a higher quantity of lead material to fight off the hazardous effect of the forest, as the many tribes of the forest have shifting loyalties, and there being no central force to organize them, it's been possible for bunkers to be set further inside their territory by playing diplomacy with them and taking zones that are only claimed by the more nomadic groups of people. Thus, these bunkers are specifically prepared against more flexible forces.

City forts differ from the more standard border fort design by the cities outright being designed as forts.
Multiple civilian buildings took to using military designs and making them into a more livable spaces. Killzones and chokepoints are designed into the city proper, and efforts into making the cities more difficult to take by a military force have been put into the school of architecture of the University.

Most army forts are organized to have local militias use them, and trained in them. And thus, great effort has been put into standardization so that a militiaman from any part of the Republic can garrison any fort of the Republic. This also means that although professional units are trained in fort usage, they are not the main garrison of them.

###Mineral Resources and Land Formation
!!!info Also WIP. Thank you, GeologyAnon[Climate Anon(/meat/)]

>I tried looking up information about what /who/ likely has in terms of minerals. From what I can tell, the more hilly area of /who/ is likely some kind of foreland basin - the land folding because the area east of it (/rrat/ highland) is being lifted up due to continental collision. RL examples of this kind of terrain includes Junggar Basin, Po Basin, and Aquitaine Basin.
>Because of the (somewhat) active volcanism and the fold structures, eastern /who/ will likely be relatively minerally rich, although maybe not as rich as those with a continental-oceanic subduction zone (which effectively melts the oceanic plate subducted under and cause its minerals to bubble up). Copper and iron can probably be expected as the main metal being mined there, although tin, gold, lead, zinc, and silver will likely be present in smaller quantities.
>Another common resource in foreland basin is hydrocarbon, since the folds create traps that allow petroleum and gas to emerge in more accessible locations. That said, the accessibility is relative, so how exploitable the oil reserve is remains ambiguous, especially with our current tech level. Coal might also be present, although the pressure there is likely not enough to make them anthracite, so bituminous coal might be more likely as carboniferous rock was pushed up and exposed by weathering.
>Speaking of weathering, precipitation brought by the westerlies likely cause a decent amount of it (although not to the same level as the constant rains of the tropics), so /who/ can probably find a decent amount of clay and mudstone, as well as some kaolinite. Bauxite might be present, but likely not enough to be economically viable (given that they would be more abundant in tropical wetland). Another effect of weathering is that minerals might be carried downstream making the coastal area somewhat richer in minerals (think panning for gold), and groundwater movement might also build up deposits in the coast (lead and zinc is the most common ones, but all metals mentioned above can be carried this way).

###Fauna

####Owls

Owls are the national symbol and figures of worship. Many scriptures also suggest that the nameless one in fact assumes the form of an owl and watches over the country(but still under fierce debate like many other notions). As such, many laws are in place to protect them. For starters, they are not to be hunted or domesticated. Though owl houses are built in almost every backyard and are encouraged. Sharing stories of their feathery tenents is a favourite pass time of the Republic's citizens. Deforestation and hunting in areas with large owl populations are also restricted and monitored. The conflict between the ceremonial value and sacredness of owls is resolved by adopting injured owls and maintaining a line of domesticated owls that descended from them. They are taken care of by professional caretakers and are kept in spacious enclosures with occasional free flying time outside. These owls are trained to perform ceremonial duties(i.e. standing on a pole and getting fed occasionally) during processions. Outside of this, all attempted domestication is forbidden.
***
#### Bubon Foxhound
->![A wild Foxhound](https://files.catbox.moe/f5ydww.jpg)<-
The Bubon Foxhound is a canid native to Northern /who/. Due to the nature of the region, details remain scarce regarding when the species was domesticated.

The carnivorous animal is known for its thick red coat of fur, pale underside and black tipped tail. Adult Bubon Foxhound tend to grow to be roughly 54-62 centimeters (21”-24.5”) with little variance between the genders. Found in the wild, they frequently hunt in smaller packs of 3-4, but gather in somewhat larger clans of around a dozen. These wild hounds are quite rare however, most are frequently found born and raised by the citizens of /who/ as either companion animals, shepherds or to assist hunters in tracking, chasing and retrieving pray anywhere from the size of a small birds to big game. It is not too uncommon to find them among foraging parties within the army.

It would not be strange to make comparisons between them and the owls of the Republic, both being highly valued animals and considered as friends of Hoomans. There are some key differences however. Much like the avian, depictions of the hound can be found in old scripts and murals depicted together with the Nameless One. Not sharing in the Nameless One’s owl-like nature, the Bubon Foxhound is not considered sacred in the same degree as the owls of the land. While any bond forged with an owl is made on their terms, the Foxhound is raised more typical to a domestic dog. Beyond any religious belief, this may be part due to their intellect and at times mischievous nature requiring them to be raised with discipline if they are to ever be able to follow a Hooman properly. As an example, even if raised well as a shepherd dog, it can at times be seen playing various tricks and pranks on farm animals when it isn’t “on duty”.

There are unfounded rumors that the aforementioned disciplining of these canine involved boiling liquid. The closest truth is that many owners report that the animal is not very fond of being bathed, and said owners admitting to at times joking about giving their companions steaming hot baths as punishment for misbehavior.

####Bubon Ursus
->![A Bubon Ursus cuddling with a Druid from the UUUing Forest, Bubon Ursus sometimes look almost completely brown when they are shedding their hair during warmer seasons](https://files.catbox.moe/bskzap.webp)<-
Also referred to as Owl-Bears are a species of bears native to the region and their territory expands across the western part of the continent.

The omnivorous animal has a thick brown fur with some stripes and patches around it of lighter color, their tails are small and brown. Adults will generally be around 200-350 centimeters tall and weights of 160-260 kg with males being slightly larger than the females. They are quite phisically able and agile, they can reach speeds of 65 km/h, powerful bites, and can crush trees easily.

In the wild they will hunt and protect their territories in small groups of 2-4 with each bear collaborating in switching patrols, the territories they range through are quite vast and as such the bears are known to not be rather relaxed in what they tolerate in their territories, multiple unrelated groups of bears can overlap on territory held with little to no issue. These groups of bears will sometimes get together with other groups around rivers during mating season, there the bears will choose partners for the next season, fights among the bears are uncommon as they are avoidant of each other.

If a couple mates and have offspring, the couple will separate from their groups and proceed to reduce their home range becoming highly territorial. The parents will proceed to care for the cub together, althought the father has to be careful due to the mother being in a highly aggresive state. Once the cub reaches a year old the parents will abandon it so that it can fend for itself.

The bears will often eat whatever they find and prey on larger animals in addition to their opportunism, this sometimes causes the bears to enter human towns and cities to scavenge food, tolerated by most of those living in the cities. The Owl-Bears are surprisingly friendly and smart, they will not attack humans as long as they aren't offended first, and their small socialization tendencies indicate that maybe they could be tamed. There are stories about children and hunters going up to Owl-Bears and hugging them, leaving unscathed, still, it is not recommended to get close to the bears regardless as they are highly respected animals and considered a symbol of the Republic.
***
#### Flightless Strigeas

Standing 1 meter or so tall, and mostly seen in the lightly forested areas in the East, these omnivores are however not considered True Owls. Although they have a superficial resemblance to owls, they lack several features that define owls such as binocular vision. Suspected to have split off from the Strigeaform Clade long ago, they behave like prey more than predators. They use their flexible necks to survey their surroundings and make up their smaller vision cone with keen hearing. The giant but blunt talons are used for picking up fruits and small prey and delivering them to their protruded beak.
These strange birds live in loose packs of 5-6. Scaredy creatures, these land birds run and screech at the slightest movement of a suspected predator.
Unfortunately, they were often the target of hunters and even children armed with slingshots. These poor critters are originally the target of a popular children's game called "Church, bat, van", being chased around until they are batted by a participant. But their once dwindling number due to overhunting is, fortunately, rebounding due to hunting restrictions, rural depopulation and rule change of "Church, bat, van".

#### Warg

***Description***
The Warg is a vaguely humanoid creature, exhibiting both canine and rodent characteristics. Members varies between 1.5m and 2.3m in length, and contrary to their emaciated appearance, can exhibit great speed and strength.
They stand on long, digitigrade legs, and can move either on all fours or upright. Both their legs and arms end in long, sharp retractable nails.
The head varies from member to member, and can resemble more a human's, or elongates into a canine or rodent like snout, which contains rows of uneven, sharp canines and strong pre-molars for crushing.
Their skin can range from pale, brown to dark grey. There's little hair on their leathery skin, except on their backs, which are usually covered in patchy fur.
Eyes are usually deep dark but seems to commonly develop severe cataracts, and they exhibit aversion to bright lights.
Wargs universally have a larger nasal cavity compared to other animals of a similar size and produce much mucus.

***Behavior***
Nocturnal creatures, Warg packs, consisting of 4-6 members, often feed on corpses, and often approach human settlement in search of graveyards though food scraps are also welcomed for these omnivores. Reports also suggest them are common at the sites of recent battles.
They also exhibit oppotuistic hunting behavior aside from foraging, though dissections and observations note that they perfers flesh over plant or fungi.
Mostly hunts smaller animals but the young of larger animals like deers are ocassional targets. Though they often are much more aggressive near herds of domesticated animals. Whether it is a learnt behavoir, innate or otherwise remains to be further investigated.
While lone members will exhibit timid behavior if spotted, packs have been reported to act aggressively, even to larger groups.
When they detect a buried corpse, the pack will exhibit unusual cooperation, with designated lookouts and diggers. Once unearthed, however, that cooperation will fall apart, as the entire pack will start fighting over the rotting parts. Once the meal is split, they will generally retreat back to a safe spot, usually a nearby forest or marshes.
Rarely roar or howl, these creatures have a low growl, but when they are fighting for food their screams are usually described as ghastly.

**Origin**
While many theories have arisen over time, trying to connect Warg to existing species, the prevailing theory nowadays is that they are a result of an unnatural mutation of the /rrat/ schizos that have been exposed to large quantities of /who/ chuubanite. Folk tales, wild speculations and rumors contributed to some amounts of border tension on some remote regions of the mutual border.

###Cities
***
####Capital City

The birthplace of the nation, the capital city was founded by settlers looking for a new life in the great north of the continent, these settlers would congregate in what used to be called the city of settlers, once war came and went, and the nation had developed in a multitude of ways, the city of settlers would recieve a new name to celebrate, the City of Victory. It is located on a hill besides the great river.

The capital is the administrative center of the Republic, it is where power is concentrated and where the headquarters of government offices are placed. It is where the house of government and state lies and organizes itself. Along with state critical infrastructure, it is where the University of the Republic has its main institution, thus making the Capital an important center for study. Due to the natural growth of the city, the use of city sectors is not present, with industrial zones overlapping residential and market places. The only places that have been actively organized in the capital are the academic and the administrative offices by the buying of land and rebuilding it as such.

The history of war has undeniably affected how the city developed, most of the architecture is rustic and durable enough material until peace was achieved, due to the status of center of the Republic, both geographically and tradition-wise, this has influenced how the Republic's architecture is shaped in general, very minimal decorations and buildings have generally blocky and triangle features over smooth shapes, as these were much harder to produce in a war economy, the use of steel has started to become more common and many buildings are being renovated with newer materials. 
While some architects have started to decide on the use of decorations, others have grown to like the simple aesthetic and defend it, causing a rift in architecture schools. 
It has various forts in and outside the city along with hosting an important military HQ and supply depots. There used to be a large wall until it got scrapped by the citizens of the city across the years for building material.

Extra notes: 
-I'm gonna have a river run from /rrat/ to /uuu/ and it passes by region 04 where the capital is placed, because might as well.
-at the top of the hill there would be the admnistrative centers, a military HQ, and the university, but I didn't do the layout of the city since I don't feel like it.
-the older part of the city is the one besides the hill, and it's expansion path took it past the river, the black lines over the river are supposed to be bridges.

##History
!!!info Very WIP, nothing is concrete for now
***
###Archaic Era History (1 VTE - ~580 VTE)

The Post-Calamity *Finats* (Pronounced Fi-Nat; City-states, though more accurately petty-states) can be categorized into three types. The Oligarchy, Archaic Republic, and Princely Republic.

Though one must first contend with the developments after the Great Collapse of the Old Empire. The protectorate had been destroyed by the combined chaos caused by the wold-splitting Calamity and the rebellion of the elites, who had grown to be dissatisfied with the defacto hereditary dynasty ruling from Noctea. The alderman from the various *Finats*, in the aftermath of the rebellion agreed to a return to the Golden Rule between the different independent polities of the land, which the Protectorate had broken with their meddling in local affairs. The *Finats* all agreed to not interfere unless asked to in other's political affairs, to unite and defend against outside invaders, and to never let a tyrant, indigenous or otherwise, to take root again. This brotherhood reinforces the trust not only between the different *Finats* but within them as well. And thus the petty-states had returned to a similar system before the subjugation of the different clans by the Old Hololive Empire.

The system of the various *Finats* had obviously adapted to many factors that have changed after more than a century of Imperial rule such as the advancement of technology, mostly in agriculture (ironically brought in by the Imperials). More cities and towns had developed. And trade flourished as the people expanded from West to east, colonizing more land. River Raika and its navigable tributaries became the economic lifeline of the various *Finats*, a situation that continued to this day for the provinces of the Republic. As the population increases and trade routes emerge, the number of cities grew. The rich and powerful clan leaders became their own social class, know as the *Tsbyuzers* (Pronounced Ssb-Yu-ser). Though, unlike the nobles down south, their position is non-hereditary (much less a segregated and regulated class). *Tsbyuzers* are better thought of as a cohort of elites that join together to manage the cities, and later the *Finats*. Influential landowners, old lineages of Magi and martial households can all become *Tsbyuzers*. Although their rise as a distinct group that are politically above the common people is intrinsically linked to the trade between different settlements and with the outside world.

Oligarchies are solely controlled *Tsbyuzers*. Oligarchies are common, especially in the East, where the population is much smaller. These *Finats* form *Fupis* (Pronounced Few-pii), committees or assemblies that meet regularly to discuss matters. Usually the *Fupis* would not exceed 50 members. Though one should also note that all general assemblies of officeholders in *Finats* are called a *Fupi*.

Archaic Republics are often described as democracies, though many modern scholars have tried to contest this idea. But whether you agree that their system is simply just pre-modern pluralist oligarchy or the seedling of the modern democratic state or not, Archaic Republics have enfranchised considerably more people compared to oligarchies. Their *Fupi* are made up of any citizen that holds office, and anyone that has the right to vote. While the voting people can voice their opinions freely, the office holders, who are in almost always *Tsbyuzers*, or common *Hyljars*  (Pronounced Hil-r-Har) with connections. In these Republics, only the *Hyljar*, cityfolks can vote or enjoy the right to office. *Vinyajar* (Pronounced Vil-Nya-Har), the rural farmers technically do not have the right to vote, even if they are landowners. But it is also at this point we run into the trouble of generalization. Before the Founding, there were around 260 different *Finats*, of which there are 40 are categorised as Archaic Republics. They are more often than not, trade powers. As such, most are either set up near the coast or along the various navigable rivers, with a larger population. These Republics, while having an obvious effect on each other's institution, are still spread out over a large area and thus differing circumstances. Since written law codes are still rare before the founding (some scholars have suggested that it might have been intentional), from first-hand accounts we know that the system between different Republics can be vastly different. So, it is more fruitful to discuss the common traits ,and of specific cases rather than casting too wide a net and risk mischaracterization.

These proto-democracies are often trade-centric cities, hosting a larger population and also more land. Farmers, and thus land owners have much less power compared to the smaller *Finats* that are often oligarchic. Although they still seek to have some sort of protection for their interests, aside from the Vow that *Poljaris* (Pronounced Po-l-yer-ii) takes after being elected. These landowners would either send representatives or ask for friends in the city to voice their concerns. And for *Finats* that do allow them to vote, they endeavor to attend the voting assemblies whenever it is possible. Some *Vinyajar* straddle the line between the rural-urban divide, due to their proximity to the city. These *Vinyajar* have deep connections in the city, and also hold more influence than faraway small farms. Take Noctea's *Vinyajar* as example, although they cannot vote, they nevertheless speak during public assemblies. In other Republics, *Vinyajar* near the city are still recognized as  *Hyljars*, and thus have a right to vote. Even if the political stature does not allow them to participate politically, through yearly festive feasts, held on important dates such as Winter Soltice, these landowners can still voice their concerns directly to those elite *Hyljar* who hold office. 

These feasts, with copious amounts of Vodka and beer is also one of the (in)formal ways the common people can enter the ranks of *Tsbyuzers*. *Hyljars* might technically have a right to hold office, but if they are not approved by enough members of the *Fupi*, he cannot run for *Poljari* or even other minor positions like a lay magus. The feasts also serve an ideological and political function. Through communion, they strengthen the bond and the sense of "brotherhood" between the members of the community. Halls and fields that serve as venues for celebrations are places where rank and office titles no longer matter. It is the ultimate expression of the egalitarianism of the system of *Finats*. Neighbouring *Finats* are invited, and conflicts, military, political and economic are either resolved here. The ritual of kissing the stone or wooden pillars erected either outside of halls or in the center of city squares symbolizes the equal (however symbolic) relationship, with the spirits as their witness. As political venues, these feasts are where *Tsbyuzers* of the *Finat* made their alliances and blocs. Since it was (and still is) widely believed that alcohol lets one reveal their true selves, the feasts gain a ritualistic element. It is how new people are inducted into the ranks of *Tsbyuzers*. The system of leagues between different *Finats* that drives the interaction during the twilight of the petty-states system also relies on this tradition. Disenfranchised peoples, *Vinyajars* and poor *Hyljars* alike can talk directly to the *Poljari* or other officials of the city, and don't have to rely on representatives like the city's military leaders or connected *Hyljars*. 

It is also worth discussing the functioning of the *Finats* Republic or Oligarchic. The common *Hyljars* and *Vinyajars* all have access to education, especially training as scribes or computers for the *Tsbyuzers*, who own most of the industries of the city. Literacy isn't a status symbol. Magi readily teach people how to read the inscriptions on the engraved pillars so common in the city and countryside. And books, while still expensive, as the trade network between different settlements has fragmented, are accessible to anyone who has an interest. Afterall, the scribes welcome anyone who can share the burden of maintaining the archives. Soldiers are all made up of citizen-militias, with *Tsbyuzer* calvary accompanying them. Taxes are collected from *Hyljars* that run businesses and funneled back to public works. Erecting new pillars, paving roads, or improving the tools of farmers. This feature is common across almost all of the *Finats*. East or West, democratic or not. 

Lastly, Princely Republics, while still ruled by the *Fupi* have princes, as their military and diplomatic leader. These *Finats* are most common along the coast or near the border with Hoshiyomia. Young nobles are often invited to serve as the head of state for a period of time, for around 10 years or more. However, they are still very much Republics. The *Fupi*, with a makeup much like the Oligarchies have the power to revoke the status of the Prince and drive him out. And the princes need to follow a strict contract between them and the *Fupi*, which the latter signed on behalf of the people. *Hyljars* and *Vinyajar* also enjoy more representation from the *Tsbyuzers* compared to the oligarchies.

Thus, the *Finats* are the only three types of polity, alongside independent communes and roving pastoral clans that constitute organized societies after the collapse of the Hololive Empire. During the last two centuries of the age of *Finats*, however, multiple non-petty-states and leagues would develop along the Raika between the late 4th and 5th centuries. Most notable of which are the Nyotean League and the State of Svadoha. The latter, also known as the "City of Settlers" would later evolve into the modern Owl Republic. This period of struggle between states only ended due to the outbreak of the massive schizo invasion.

***
###Svadoha/ The "City of Settlers"

While the wider continent was undergoing large change, many new settlers from across the land were looking up to the settling of the great north once again, a land abandoned by previous empires and left to develop on is own. The settlers came from many places across the continent, and using the pathway from Hoshiyomia and the mountains they arrived to form the city of settlers, there many new peoples were conflicting with each other and religious disputes were forming, it is said, that the formation of the common religion came from multiple religious leaders observing owls hunt pests around the newly forming city. From this point onwards, the religious temples and leaders agreed to the worship of owls to cleanse the city of pests.
This is, of course, a myth, no one is quite sure on how the religion formed, and there are multiple stories on how it did, but it is one corroborated by history. The formation of the religion managed to unite the splintered city into a single political entity, as it was divided into multiple political factions wishing to expand their own influence into the new lands.

As the city had been formed by circumstance it suffered from the issue of having no central authority to govern itself by, leading to a large boom in trade and movement of money in the city.
Large scale conflict with outside tribes and enemy groups in the region brought an end to this arrangement, the growth of the city had inflicted upon the previous status quo and forced the region into wars, the first institution by which the city had arranged itself was not a religious temple, as was expected by the citizens of the city, but by a coalition of the postal workers working under the "Delivery and Retrieval Office" and various manufacturers that used the chance to strangle the power out of the religious temples.
This effectively formed the first "Postal State" in the history of the world, this "Postal State" Reorganized all armed forces in the city and its outsides to wage the first siege war, forceful recruiting of neutral parties and aggressive expansion fueled the postal state until a peace could be achieved against the inmediate neighbours, such a peace came at the cost of these neighbouring states and their lands were annexed into the city.

By now, the Postal State was too big for it's own good, so the decision to reorganize the government came by popular demand and the Postal State being overstreched in its administration, this incredibly violent period in history was blurry, many records were erased and the religious temples began aiming to obtain power once again, this messy and relatively unrecorded part of history resulted in the formation of the presidential agreement, where the leader of the nation would be elected by popular demand, and his actions would then be approved by a council, this council was originally made up of important sponsors of the nation, and it would take a long way for it to become representative of the regions and the people in it.
Upon the formation of the Presidential Agreement, the new reorganized state began the preparations for the invasion to the east, where multiple enemy groups often planned their raids and border clashes were common. This "March to the East" was bloody and suffered from many issues, mainly logistical ones until the complete elimination of the enemy presence, a similar "March to the West" was planned but suffered from many setbacks, mainly the tiredness of the population from constant war and economic issues from having to reorganize the political structure of the Eastern Hills and mountains.
Political development was mainly characterized by the temples trying to gain influence over the government and the people of the nation seeking further representation other than by means of the Presidential Agreement, before the new "March to the West" was fully prepared the Legislative office separated itself from the military and forced itself under civilizan leadership, done in part to ease the logistical burden upon the military and in part to weaken the presidential office by the temples, this structure would eventually end up out of the control of the Temples too.

The history of the temples was one of embracing humanist rethoric to further goals of the expansion of the new agreement, those that were not human were seen as lesser and a common philosophy was that of Human Supremacy over the world, it is one that belongs to humans. This made the Religious temples quite belligerous, but it was seen as convenient by every other influential power in the State, especially due to the wars that were going on, so it was allowed to be born and embraced by many.

Finally, the time for the march to the west had come, and a lightning campaing was done over the regions using the experience gained in the bogged down wars to the east, the wars were decisive in their nature and simply seen as a duty that must be completed by the State.
The economic situation improved thanks to the mass planting of potatoes in the east and the usage of wheat in key parts where not much food could be grown, saving the nation from various potential starvations and gaining a surplus in food.
Once the March to the west was completed, it was time for a national reorganization, ending in the formation of the current Republican structure, the temples were completely removed from positions of power and heavily decentralized, instead displaced into places where they'd serve the population much more directly. Since the march to the west, a long peace was established and the nascent Republic was allowed to further its economic goals for the first time, and for its population to grow large and request for the expansion of their rights. What follows the future of this nation is still unsure to many.

###Notes on the Founding War

- The Republic gets established unceremoniously in an unowned land plagued by schizos
- The exact age of the Republic will be kept vague to allow me more flexibility while writing lore, but it is a very young one.
- Large amount of population starts moving in
- War began against the schizos
- War is economically heavy on the Republic
- War influenced how the Republic was shaped
- The Republic becomes an expert at siege warfare
- The war is a very confusing affair
- War ended relatively quickly and decisevly
- War may or may have not influenced the lack of etiquette, why the people are so crude and the somewhat intense street culture

- The war against the schizos may or may not intersect with the lore of other council splits, it is down to their choosing
- If they do choose so, that would also have to make the council splits interested in sharing the lore also about as young as the Republic
- Potential ways other splits could share the lore
with /nasa/: some of the schizos in the tundra may have fought in the wars, they may have moved north after getting eliminated from the lands owned by the Republic
with /uuu/: Druids may have began their religion when the forest and mother nature aided them in the removal of schizos
with /rrat/: The order of the monks may have begun as a martial order to kick others off from their mountains, similar to /uuu/ in that regard.
with /infinity/: dunno

##Politics and Governance 

###Administrative division
The Owl Republic divides its sovereign soil into 9 provinces, or *Vedyrp* (Pronounced Ved-i-rup). Each *Vedyrp* is subdivided into a different number of *To’ryrp* (Pronounced Tor-i-rup), or counties under its administration. Metropolitan cities and regional capitals form their own *To’ryrp*. *To’ryrps* are further divided into *Omes* (Pronounced O-mei), or townships. The national capital also constitutes as its own *To’ryrp*, with its own parliament. However all state-level government buildings and land fall into the direct jurisdiction of the state.

Much more relaxed than in previous eras in history, the *Vedyrps* enjoy comparatively more freedom than before. They are led by an indirectly elected governor, decided by the votes or party composition of the province's Parliament. While the *To’ryrps* are ruled by committee, without central leadership.

***
###Election
The Republic is one of the very few countries that have implemented a system of Universal Suffrage. Elections are organized by the Bureau of Elections under the Department of State affairs. Citizens aged 18 or above, no matter their sex and occupation can register as a voter in their respective local Voting Offices operated by provincial branches of the Bureau. The Bureaus in different Voting *To’ryrps* organise elections, maintains the electoral roll, and count the votes. Though starting from the 12th century, a system of independent commissions, the Provincial Anti-graft Commission is also established in different local administrations to oversee the conduct and running of elections.

All positions in the Provincial *Suprr* (Parliament; Pronounced S-purr), State *Zvacha* (Council; Pronounced S-Va-cha), and the Presidential seat are elected by the citizen-electorate. All votes utilize a single-member plurality voting method to determine the results of an election.

Presidential elections are held every 6 years, *Zvacha* every 3 years, for half of its seats, and the *Suprr* every 4 years for all of its seats. While the seats for the *Suprr* vary depending on the number of counties and population in each province, every *Vedyrp* is entitled to equal representation in the *Zvacha*, of 20 seats for a total of 180 council members

### Notes on the Political System

- Unitary presidential republic
- Regions have their elected officers participate in the republic (regional divisions still pending)
- Still very centralized
- Technically anyone can try to get elected
- Rough factions and party system has formed (factions will be revised later)
- Government departments will often have their own recruiting systems, but have to go by guidelines established by the Republic
- R.I.D. keeps documents on every elected officer
- Urban regions are more militant (to increase the industrial power of the cities and republic as a whole)
- Rural centers are more economically liberal (to get military demands out of their backs and increase their potential selling yields)
- President has a cabinet of the departments and persons of relevancy

###Postal Service
The Republic's citizens are avid readers. But with such a large amount of literate population, and the absence of long-range, mass communication methods that can connect friends and relatives, separated by the rapid advance of industry and progress, an efficient and standardised post system is needed.
Luckily, the infrastructure in the Republic enables mail and parcels to reach from the Easternmost mining towns to the ports in the West in mere days. The Postal Department is also well funded, both by the government and the massive amount of citizens who enlist their service. Aside from selling normal stamps, the Department also prints special editions that are prized within the not insignificant collector circles within the nation.

Pigeon Post: Every city & town has at least one post office that houses messenger pigeons. For rural areas, post offices in the junctions between villages would have some capacity to house and send pigeons.
Their value as battlefield messengers is of course not lost to the military. The carrier pigeons in military service are all bred and trained with the help of professionals from the Postal Department. Whether military or civilian, they all wear a small whistle to ward off birds of prey.
There are also specially bred breeds. The most famous of all is the Northern Messenger. They boast a fast training and memorisation process than regular doves. They have longer necks, wider bodies and longer feathers. There is also the noticeable outgrowth of the eye cere, and their duller color (mostly brown & light grey, almost no white). Their more developed muscle and wings allow them better endurance and slightly faster flight, but these birds are also bigger and need more movement space. As such, they are mostly only suitable to be used in conjunction with special carts for the military or from fixed locations.
Their exploits are often recorded in commercial books, the press and official histories. Though their significance is, of course, lower than the national avian of the Republic, they nevertheless have their own attire during parades and celebrations. Military pigeons usually wear a small gorget, helmet and harness during such occasions. And civilian pigeons are dressed in colorful feathers and masks.

Balloon Mail: Both coal and chuubanite driven air balloons are available for the postmen of the Department. Mostly running fixed routes, they still often go where is needed too. Balloons are used for delivering urgent medium weight parcels like medicine to remote villages(mail posts in rural areas have dedicated landing pads).
Though limited by the weather, fuel and slightly slower than pigeons on average, they are still extremely flexible.
The artillery observation corps of the army has its roots in the balloon pilots of the Postal department. The corps continually draws some of its personnel from skilled balloon postmen.

Horse & Carriage: The most common method and delivers the largest volume, despite the Republic's large pigeon fleet, more than half of the mail and parcels are transported by horses. Horse carriages are used to centrally distribute to various smaller posts both within cities and between villages. Stamps are also tiered, least expensive and most common stamps are transported by horse instead of pigeon or other alternative methods.
Green: Horse Blue: Pigeon Yellow: International(i.e. Ship) / Add on: Orange for mail that needs ballon transport; Red for urgent

Intra-city Mailing: While there are some pigeon services within larger cities, many postboys run mail around the cities on push velocipedes. The many narrow city streets, while excellent for defending, are however not very suitable for horses or carriages. Once you leave the wide main avenues near the centre, such vehicles are needed to deliver mail in residential areas in a timely fashion. There are also pedal-driven ones but they are slowly catching on.

Messenger Ravens: A lot less common and limited in number, but they are more flexible than pigeons. These smart critters can memorise more locations, and their intended destination is communicated through coloured cards by their handler. Limited to daytime and range, they are only carried by a select few offices or in the military, higher-level or command units.

### Information Corps (RID)

Information, be it scientific, technical, or folk, is an important form of advancing the power available to humanity, unfortunately, there are those that do not wish for their knowledge to spread and keep them under wraps. Equally there is such information that must not fall to potentially dangerous elements. This necessitated the creation of a single, coordinated governmental department dedicated to intelligence and counter-intelligence.

3 different pre-existing "information corps" were consolidated into a single entity by various officials and leaders of the nation over the recent decades:
The 1st being the "Special Diplomatic Division" (SDD). Agents that the Republic had for diplomatic and interstate activities, they were mainly involved in obtaining and stealing anything that comes from other states and political entities, also dealing with backdoor deals. 

2nd was the "Committee of Military and Disciplinary Action" (CMDA). It was the information Corps of the Military before consolidation, while the SDD dealt directly with interstate activities the MDA was originally tasked as an internal police force for the armed forces, it very quickly evolved into an espionage force for obtaining enemy plans and infiltrating their leadership structures, penal battalions were often used and reformed into units for these goals, in short, causing as much mayhem inside enemy formations and knowing their next steps. 

3rd is a tad different from the others, being originally formed by lower class citizens and middle class merchants to "Protect the Republic" the "Republican Vanguards" (RV) was an extremely violent and aggressive counter-intelligence volunteer organization that wished to uproot any potential infiltrators and enemy agents. Their success rate was originally quite low, though they very quickly gained much experience and became an extremely competent organization.

Further information about these organizations and their structures has been scrubbed from books, although inferences can be made based on records about how they acted. 

All of these organizations were forcefully unified and consolidated in structure into the Republic Intelligence Division (RID) by multiple leaders of these organizations and by Presidential pressure. Notably, the main reason the organizations united is said to be due to a shared interest in technology and intelligence regarding technology. Thus, the new organization took on all previous duties and jumbled a lot of its personnel together to maximize its experience and has a current interest in tech stealing. Very little is publicly known about its activities since the consolidation, however.

###Political Factions, Movements

####Vanguardism
Vanguardism is a movement that emerged after the end of the 11th century. Since the mid-11th century, there has been a steady downfall of large-scale schzio invasions, though their threat is not completely eliminated. The movement originated from conservative thinkers and retired law enforcement agency personnel. They claimed that the civilian Vanguards of the past have lost their revolutionary spirit, becoming another bureaucracy within the state. They were also later joined in by Orthodox Temple priests who despises other gods of the Pantheon. Maintaining peace and stability and eliminating any lurking threats against the state requires drastic action and authoritative measures for Vanguardists. Harassment, parades, and petitions are common activities. Though even organized gangs are not below them. Vanguardists within state and public organizations also abuse their status and power sometimes to achieve their ideology. While they are usually treated no more than a nuisance by the public due to their relatively small size it cannot be denied their effect on public discourse. Back and forth complaints fill the letters section of newspapers. Some scholars have even attributed the increased emigration to the Central Empire in recent decades to the activities of the movement. The central government does not have the constitutional power or enough excuse to remove them, however. Complaints and offenses were dealt with on a case-by-case basis much to the annoyance to many citizens.

###Diplomacy

####Relations with Infinitum

The relationship between the Republic and the Theocracy of Infinitum is a complicated tale. These two countries share a similar origin, the result of the great migration spurred by the birth of the group of Gods known as "Council". But just a mere mention of the name Infinitum would visibly revolt most people in the Republic. Their relationship can be best summed up as a rivalry and traditional, mutual hatred.

This rift in bilateral relations likely originated even before the Theocracy was established. It is said that the "Takeshis", the ancestors of the majority of Kronies currently living on the Island of Infinity were extra-terrestrials. Or at least adopted some practice of realms of the Outer Gods, especially the realm of the Blue Bird and the Icon of Discord. The culture, dedicated almost entirely to carnal desires was recorded by Hoomans traveling and staying in Infinitum. The relative isolation of the country, together with a lack of representation of the population in the central Empire means that the overwhelming records described the Kronies in a quite unfavorable light, whether or not they truly deserved it. 

This difference would become even greater, even as the Republic is focused on quelling its own struggle for existence. Individuals within the Theocracy, coined "Clingyronies" by Infinitum scholars, started to write tomes and manuscripts disparaging the Nameless One. As told by one Vojnomir Bakal, a travelling merchant writing in the 7th century VTE, "...the Clock-Folks rioted in the capital, defacing temples built by Kronies who also seek the light from the Moom. They chanted hateful words while marching down the streets, barely held back by the Enforcers from the district where all 'Kromei' faithfuls lived. Who knew envy could bring such hatred?". The internal strife concerning the status of the Nameless One within the Theocracy cemented the image of an uncivil and illogical people. In the eyes of Hoomans, the weird sexualization towards groups and individuals produced even more disgust towards the "Clock-Folks". Following the period that Kronies call the "Golden Age", their practice of attempting to insert their genitalia into anything even remotely sentient extended to the people who worship the Nameless One. Needless to say for a relatively speaking, sexually conservative culture, how much of a shock this is to the Republican intelligentsia.

What really set the two countries onto a path of almost direct confrontation was the result of irregular sea-borne raids conducted by Kronies on the Republic. Continuing into the present day, albeit less frequently, these raids originated from the aforementioned tension and what can best be described as nationalist sentiment within Infinitum. As time goes on political and religious factions of the Island also used it to their advantage, pillaging for influence and their ideological needs. Infinitum's infamous concentration of Schizos helped maintain this "tradition". Whether doing so in the name of a faction, or with their own raiding party, countless raids conducted against the Republic's people fueled the cycle of hatred. Times when the Nameless One and the Lady of Time are broadcasting together from the heavenly realm, are when raiding activities are the most intense.

The inability or passive refusal of the Island's government to address the various grievances of the people of the Republic has ultimately contributed to a feeling of cold indifference or even seething hatred for the Clock People on the frigid Island of Infinity. Even then, one must not forget that unofficial, private connections and exchanges still happened regularly, even when the two governments grew distant. As diplomatic missions and communication between official functions have slowed down a half-frozen state for decades even before the Great Cold hit the Island nation, population movements due to trade and research became the only real window for the two peoples. Understanding the root of this rift between the supposed sister nations, not only gives much-needed context for Republican schadenfreude towards Infinitum's crises, but also the evolution of foreign policy and international outlook for much of the Republic's history.

### Education
All children once reached the age of 7 are subject to at least 8 years of compulsory education. Children of eligible age are first educated at Grammar Schools for 5 years, and then the Collegiate for 3 years. In the Collegiate, pupils need to choose to either continue their standard Collegiate courses or to start a vocational course in trades. After graduating from the Collegiate , these teens have the choice between starting work or continuing their education. The third tier of education institutes are the College and various trades schools. Usually lasts for 2 years, the College prepare students for the Academy and trades schools teaches advanced trades skills.

The four main subjects of the Grammar Schools and the first year of Collegiate are the Arts, Sciences, Society and Physical. Arts cultivates language and artistic skills and Society teaches the basics of the Republic's politics and history, with a side of Theology. Young hoomans learn about math(particularly hated by them) and nature through Sciences while Physical teaches basic skills like sewing and woodworking.

The Academy is the highest and most prestigious rank of education. Only 5% of students are able to be admitted. It's simultaneously one of the most important institutes of the Republic as the various Academies are where the bulk of research and development happens. The Ministry of Innovation and the military keep a close relationship with the Academies and evaluate their research output. Any findings worthwhile are funded by the state or in some cases the private sector, and quickly exploited in the name of progress. Although this doesn't always pay off the program maintained the Republic's relative technological advantage over the years. Military and Commerce Academies exist but they are vastly different from the Academy for research and require a different pathway to enter.

However, due to the neeed for manpower in agricultural activities, rural families could usually only afford to send only one children to school, or to have them quit prematurely after they finished their most basic education in the Grammar Schools.

###The Library System of the Republic
->![Pixiv ID: 97054811](https://files.catbox.moe/hbbjgr.jpg)<-

In it's efforts for centralization of education and existing information, the Library is there for such uses along with multiple subsections in cities and towns to ensure the free access to information and education to the people.
The state manages what it calls the library system, where all libraries in the Republic are organized after, it's goal is for every person in the Republic to have access to a library nearby them. To achive this the Republic has taken to building up such centers of knowledge in all urban centers, even small villages have relatively access to a library. Often times library managers will be taught basic education techniques for any children that desire to improve their reading skills, and schools have mandatory trips to libraries to foment the habit of reading in the youths.

Currently the biggest library in the Republic is the Central Library residing in an important city of the Republic, it acts as the headquarters of the Library System, and it is setup in such a way as to make sure there will be no book or document lost if a disaster were to befall it. Its concentration of books deals with anything from basic cooking recipes to collections of the legends and mythological stories regarding many sites of the continent. An important part of the central library is the somewhat large research center it has and the many professors that work inside it. Althought the structure of the central library was meant to be simple and easy to understand, some would argue that it is pretty much a maze. Book stores are commonly run by private enterprises, but they still have to deal with the guidelines set by the Library System in order to not be closed.

If a foreigner asks someone in the street about finding relevant information, the most common response will be to "[check the library](https://rentry.org/ei9vd)".

##Economy and Industry

###Overview
Due to the violent beginnings of the Republic, formed in the middle of war and conflict, the impressive and fast mobilization had influenced the Republic to produce cheap and reliable goods to feed and arm its needs, all the while also funding research and development to aid in the mass production directed for the harsh conditions of the wars. Once the wars were over after the Republic managed to fully secure itself, it still mantained its preference for cheap and reliable, as can be observed from the cloth infustry that exists, you most certainly won't find high quality cloth, but instead a large amount of cheaper products that will do the job right.
The Republic's first economic sector is made up of agricultural produce that has been addresed in a previous document, and the mining sector, as the large amount of hills and woods of the land allow for it. Of these, iron, coal, aluminium, and some amounts of potassium are the main ores drilled from the mines. These resources are then brought to manufacturing centers where they will be processed by the smiths.
Steel working has sped up recently in order to sustain the Republic's growing infrastructure and as an export to trade. The previously mentioned cloth industry, also referred to as the textiles industry has a solid economic base due to its importance, and is currently growing. The shipmaking markets and the ports are constantly working thanks to growing naval investment in part of the Republic, it also takes care of assisting the Hoshiyomia navy in its duties and providing logistics aid to them. Alcoholic beverages are produced and sold in the nation, of particular note is the one made from fermenting potatoes, originally starting from a moonshine operation to raise funds, it got nationalized and turnt into a state controlled industry to avoid further issues relating to legality, another popular alcoholic beverage is beer made from wheat, the mountain monks tend to enjoy the drinks a lot despite the differences with their own traditional drinks, so they are big buyers for it.
Cans of food and the canning industry, originally for military use only, is now being repurposed for civilian and economic use as a way to ensure the safety of food across large distances, most popular with soldiers are the famed canned potatoes and meat.
The arms industry is somewhat large, as the Republic had it as a priority for much time, however, with the relaxation of militarism in the country, weapons are mainly left in stockpile and not sold away, with almost no arms trade taking place unless it is with direct allies such as Hoshiyomia.
Trading agreements with the druids of /uuu/ are difficult to do as they are very self sufficient, but the free movement of goods across their territory means that the Republic still ends up as the main trader in the area.
While you may not think so, the Republic holds a very advanced national newspaper and is the main paper producer of the region, even if the printing presses that are used are faulty and prone to breakdowns, this has lead to a widespread hate for printing presses and the difficulties of dealing with them by the population.

###Currency
The Republican Beryl (RB) is represented by a coin made from red brass (9/10 copper, 1/10 zinc). 25 mm in diameter and 2.25 mm thick. Its design features a feather on the obverse and a regional marking on the reverse, according to the bank it was minted by.
5 Beryl coins have the same measurements as 1 Beryl coins. The alloy is changed to 1/10 copper and 9/10 silver, along with a different design, featuring the eye of an owl on the obverse side and a plumed helmet on the reverse side.

The subunit of Beryl, a "Talon" is valued at 1/5 of a RB. Its diameter is 15 mm with a thickness of 1.75 mm. Its metal content is 9/20 copper, 8/20 Zinc and 3/20 nickel. On its observe is a traditional spearhead of the Republic, and a galloping horse on the reverse. Though as its namesake, an Owl's talons are no longer featured on most of the coins in circulation, it is also known as a Fifth outside of the Republic.
A demi-talon, valued at 1/10 of a RB has the same exact dimension as the normal Talon. Though it's completely made of Zinc. Its observe design is a resting Owl and the reverse design the Escutcheon of the Republic


Paper currency valued 10 RB upwards uses a special paper mixture with hard to imitate designs to ensure its validity.
The paper bills are issued for 10 beryls, 50 beryls, and 100 beryls. Its observe features natural scenery and famous mountains or rivers of the Republic. On its reverse side are the payment pledge and information of the bank which issued the bills. Proposals for larger quantity bills are to be considered whenever the bank regulator agency considers it appropriate.


Minting is done by a variety of private banks and enterprises, all regulated by the national bank, who sends orders of design and changes in minting techniques. All banks in the Republic receive a monthly guide on these changes.

Massive changes in wealth, mainly by large sales, are done by a check system where the national bank will officiate it, local banks will have to mail it to the national bank and as a result they may take longer than smaller wealth exchanges.

***
###Taxes and Economics
Economic policy is dictated first by the government's department of economics, it recieves advice and requests from the other departments, the department of ecomony does yearly reviews from every 4th month and 6th day for however long is needed where it will check fund allocation and collect taxes. In these yearly reviews the department will also organize business owners, farmers, traders, economic theorists, industrialists along with industrial workers, and miners under the "Industrial Strategy Meetings" to further the economic strength of the Republic, currently divided between the industrialist faction, the neo-physiocrats as the biggest factions, but there are multiple smaller factions working towards securing certain goals.

The Republic's tax system is at a national scale and regulated by the Republican Revenue and Income that employs the aid of the National Bank and the Postal Service under the Department of Economics.
The RRI as an office performs investigations and rulings on fiscal crime and those that have commited rule breaks. They have wide ranging powers to ensure the swift workings of the government's bureaucracy and are feared by those working in grey areas. They end up being a law enforcement agency all on their own.
Yearly tax collection is done by the postal service of the Republic under direction of the RRI, typically armed with pistols and short blades if the need comes by, a common urban legend of the postal service is how they'll lay siege towards entire sectors of a city if they do not obtain what they ask for.
The national bank aids the postal service and the RRI by easing adminstrative tasks.

Tax grants can be given according to certain ventures a citizen may or may not take, decorated soldiers, centers of institution, researchers in sciences and technology, physically discapacitated persons, among others can all recieve tax relief by 5% to 20%. Research grants by the government are not subject to taxation. Government administration workers all recieve a 5% tax reduction by default.

The progressive income tax of the Republic has an average tax rate of around 10%, with around 18% maximum.
Taxable Income | Marginal Tax Rate | Maximum Tax Payable at Bracket level
------ | ------ | ------
3000 - 5000  | 4%  | 200 
5001 - 10000   | 8%  | 400
10001 - 25000  | 14% | 2100
25001 -35000 | 18% | 1800
>35000 | 22% | -

For example, an unmarried high level government clerk that makes 28450 RB annually without any sort of tax grants would have to pay:
!!! note (200 + 400 +2100) + [(28450 * 95%) - 25000] * 18% 
	= 3064.95 = 3065 RB
	with an effective tax rate of 10.77%.

Property tax is considerably lower at a stunning rate of 0%, property is not taxed unless the land is unused by the owner, in which case it is taxed at a rate of 20% by the sale of land. Property tax remains in debate by the Industrial Strategy Meetings. 

Corporation tax is a recent addition to the taxation rules, before that corporations and business fell under income tax rulings. Corporation tax works by the reviewing of individual tax against the income and earnings of the company, individuals are unable to dodge taxation by investing towards the company for the company itself will be taxed by percentages to what has been invested in it. This only applies to the initial investment.

Discussion towards the taxing of individual gains on finalized investments are still ongoing. Generally, 15% taxes on investments towards a company is the standard, but it may grow depending on how large the company in question grows. In addition to the investment tax, companies are also taxed for earnings at a rate of 5% to 20%, companies may apply for tax relief if the products they market are considered strategic goods.
Regarding foreign companies, taxation is much heavier, with up to 60% taxes on investment and earnings.
Businesses generally have steady and low tax rates, up to 5% starting from 1% due to the nature of consumer goods in the Republic. Small business owners may request reductions in personal income tax to care further for their businesses.

Tariffs are multiple, they target foreign products to ensure that Republican products remain cheaper than them unless it is a product that does not exist in the Republic, in such a case the tariff is reduced.
As an example, steel is the subject of protection and foreign steel is subject to heavy tariffs up to 100%. However it is a very extreme case.
Most foreign products recieve an import tariff rate of 2% to 25% depending on the product. As an example, foreign foodstuffs are not taxed as much as foreign wool is.
Those under the reduced tariff rule start at 2% and max out at 10%
Export tariffs on the other hand are given out according to strategic and diplomatic need, exports toward rival or unfriendly regimes get large tariffs while exports toward direct allies can recieve negative tariffs.
Only direct allies may recieve tariff reductions, tipically for strategic resources as is the case for Hoshiyomia and their need for potatoes and their navy's relationship towards the Republican one.
Free trade agreements may be given out to allied nations in which their exports and imports recieve very few tariffs.

###Agriculture

####Overview
The River Raika and other major rivers of the Republic deposit silty material around their alluvial plains and valleys. Making many of the areas near the gentle meanders of the rivers possess good loamy soil for agricultural use. These relatively flat areas are the breadbasket of the Republic and much of the North-West Ailivian Continent. 

The flat and fertile West traditionally host the majority of the population and agricultural output, while the frigid North and Barren East mostly consists of wide, open pasture lands between the rolling hills and few farms that feed the population centers. 

The three main staple crops in the Republic are wheat, potatoes and rice.

Wheat farming has the longest history in the Republic. Evolving from simple slash-and-burn fields to the 3-year crop rotation cycle practiced today in many state-owned and communal farms. The fodder created from the rotation process also helps feed farm animals, both for drafting and animal products. Which is a departure from the historical role of the West as being almost a purely horticultural producer that imports cattle from the East, as a part of the epic cattle drives along the banks of the Raika. As the population grew in the East, more land are converted to farmlands as more efficient ways of cultivation, where potatoes are featured heavily alongside other cereal crops like buckwheat and spring wheat. Although the East was described to have sandy loams, which were only productive for potatoes, some grasslands away from the rivers had developed mollisol, suitable for both planting and pasturing. These factors while differentiating East and West less and less in terms of agricultural output, did allow the population to grow and prosper in the previously improvised East. 

In the West especially, impressive irrigation and drainage systems, consisting of canals reinforced with bricks controls the water level before seeds are sown. These irrigation systems are increasingly used for sedentary pastures in the West for the Diary, Wool and Meat industry. Near the Hoshiyomian border, however, the coastal regions are suitable for rice growing. As such, similar systems are modified to supply water for rice paddies, and they are exported to the East and North, along the navigable rivers.

###Paper and Printing Industry
Influenced by the Nameless One's teachings, the Republic practices archive keeping keenly. This led to a higher standard and volume of paper making even during the establishment of the Republic compared to other nations. This trend is maintained by a robust state-funded education program and a large population of avid readers in the Republic. The Republic's papers are mostly made from flax and cotton, though research into cheaper paper production using wood pulp have been sucessful. The paper and printing industry is expected to enjoy a boom thanks to this breakthrough.

Newspapers run daily in cities and most towns, and the demand for books consolidated the publishing scene of the Republic into several prolific publishers. The most famous and oldest newspaper is the Weekly Owl(Unrelated to the most circulated paper, the Daily Owl). Due to the large market and experienced publishers, many foreign authors from the region would choose to publish their works in the Republic. The surplus of printing capacity means books and papers are one of the most important exports for the economy. Maps are another famous paper product of the Republic. While military maps are of course strictly forbidden from exportation, the Republic's maritime maps are famed for their accuracy and quality.

To satisfy the hunger for more paper, each city has large paper mills and printing presses. But due to the unreliability of early models, and the somewhat sacred quality of papers, early hoomans learned to hate the printing machines. "Printer" became the popular slang for an irritating person, and evolved into the word meant for heretics sprouting disparaging information against the Nameless One use today.

### Gunpowder
All gunpowder production in the Owl Republic are state owned and controlled. Saltpeter is produced both by the importation of crude, unrefined saltpeter and local farms. Each farmstead is required to either build a saltpeter barn on their own land (state owned farms usually have their own barns and sometimes refine their own saltpeter from the resulting decomposed material), or have their manure to be centrally collected by the local government, and placed in a public niter bed. Though some in the government have long pushed for the freeing up of farmer's burden of manure collection, which hampers the yield by taking away precious fertilizers, imported sources of niter and fertilizers produced from it have made the argument die down considerably. And farmers are still subsidized or awarded tax exemptions for their cooperation. 

The resulting saltpeter is of good quality, when combined with selectively sourced charcoal and distilled, disinfected water, and sulfur produces some of the best powder in the world. The raw materials are shipped to the various powder mills in the country, which all by now have standardized, variable speed water mills, resulting in consistent pressing and corning of powder. The introduction of steam engines also increased production somewhat by being able to pump water from elsewhere during drier seasons or increasing the speed of the wheels beyond their normal speed. Though like many state owned factories, the recent introduction of expansion engines has made the Department of Economics to consider retrofitting all production facilities with direct steam driven mills or at least supplement them with one. But the biggest obstacle is the high production of gun powder, which the Republic already has too much of. Due to this reason, the Owl Republic is also one of the biggest exporters of gun powder, mostly slower burning powder for blasting and some high quality hunting powder with powder intended for war reserved for close partners and allies.

The country also produced the Grade XI powder, which incorporated chuubanite in its pulverizing and glazing process. Coal chuubanite is added during the pulverization.  And Vitubim from chuubanite in the country, produced from burning, then condensing the steam resulting from it, are added to a secret, proprietary mix of chemicals, which results in an alternate glazing material from graphite. The coating is relatively waterproof and provides extra heat and energy when detonated, which allowed the operation of firearms in the rain (chance for hang fire is considerably reduced). The powder also produces less smoke, almost half of normal, high quality powder. And despite eschewing graphite as the glazing material, is still easy to pour. Scholars have long debated what exactly causes the Grade XI to detonate when it doesn't come into contact with any activator substance. The current most popular thesis is that the compound created by the coating when it is ignited triggers the vitubium compound, which in turn also induces the chuubanite within to explode beyond the normal powder ingredient within. 

The Grade XI is most popular aboard as a hunting and sporting priming powder, which are corned more finely than normal priming powder. The powder produces less smoke and flash when denoted, and the more violent reaction also ignites the charge faster, allowing the prey less time to escape when the trigger was pulled. The powder is of course best known within the country as an powder reserved for the elite forces. The Grade XI destined to the arsenals are milled to a smaller grain than usual, because the chuubanite coal introduced bonds more weakly than normal powder, despite the coating also acting as a protector. As such, Grade XI is only used in small arms, which the rangers and elite light infantry units are able to exploit its advantage the most. The smoke produced by the powder makes shots made from a treeline virtually invisible beyond 70 yards, and the slightly higher velocity also gives the bullet better ballistics. The powder also produces a brilliant blue and amber colored flame when ignited. Although the biggest downside to the powder is the fouling that comes with repeated use. 

The fouling is lightly hydrophobic, unlike normal fouling, which make it harder to clean in field conditions. The problem is especially present in rifles, which sometimes outright prevent the ball to be loaded as the grooves become filled with a compound containing spent chuubanite or impure chuubanite that was left in during manufacturing, making the fouling harder. The same problem is also present in shooters that use the Grade XI in sporting or hunting but these uses usually do not fire for long enough during each use for the fouling to become a problem. But the Grade XI also faces competition, as a solid priming compound was invented in 1118. The new type of primer are contained in their stand alone caps instead of being loose powder. Although the Grade XI will most likely see to be displaced by these caps in all fields, as a result of massive efforts from the Military to modify the service rifles into cap fired guns, Grade XI is still expected to remain as a situational but highly effective powder, and the branding effect still makes it one of the go to powder for many hunters both foreign and domestic to use it before cap fired guns have replaced most firearms in the world.
