"How regrettable! Lamentable even! Sensei seems so lazy, but he has the eyes of a hawk! How am I supposed to enjoy a good show like this!? ...Tehehe, jokes aside, Sensei is a reliable Jonin. I'm proud to have him as a teacher. I like to think that he and I get along quite well."

>D
"I rather torn when it comes to Little D. Most of the time his overconfidence is a joy to see. He either succeeds and shows off, which is OK, or he fails and absolutely seethes, which is great. When it comes to missions however... Well, if he goes charging into the enemy base without so much as consulting the rest of the team one more time, then I'm going to personally ensure all of his medicine is laced with laxatives for the next month. Even the medicine he doesn't get directly from me."

>Himari Miko
"A frail, humble, and kind-hearted maiden who certainly wouldn't do anything mean. Wouldn't even hurt a fly... Is the joke anyway. I'm self-aware enough to know that my drama-seeking isn't what one would consider a good trait. Even so, it's not like I'm heartless or anything. At the end of the day I'm just another medical-nin. I love the world and I love to see the people around me healthy and lively, not so depressed that they hide in their shells for fear of saying the wrong thing. I think a little drama is good for people."

>Takeru Suzuki
"While this isn't a popular opinion, I find his rapid fire chatter a bit endearing. It probably helps that I can keep up with the torrent of information. It's a bit of a shame that Takeru keeps me from messing with Little D too much, but he more than makes up for it during missions. This one time, Little D jumped headfirst into an enemy ambush (right after I told him that it was obviously a trap), and Takeru practically just snapped his fingers and summoned Little D back. It turned out that Little D had one of Takeru's summoning tags on him. Ahhh... Little D looked like someone just kicked his dog. Refreshing."

>Osamu
"As much as I love some drama in Konoha, death, trauma, and unwanted biological engineering isn't my idea of prime entertainment. I did hear a rumor about him making androids fashioned after the female Jonin however. Which is creepy, but also profoundly hilarious since it wasn't my problem."

>Shimabukuro Fumio
"Hmm... Honestly? There's drama, and then there's this guy. Truth of the matter is that I just feel sorry for him."

>Kichōna
"Girl's crazy. Really though. Who the hell let this father and daughter pair into this village? Kichona's at least a nice girl when she takes her meds and stays calm, but still... Anyway, I can't say I care to interact with her. When she's calm she's too boring. When she's not calm things get too serious."

>Nodao-Douji
"Endless. Hours. Of. Entertainment. Noda-chi and I have been good friends since we first entered the trainee academy, and it's been nothing but good things. For us. I heal her wounds and use by substance production to make free alcohol, she causes drauma and havoc in her wake, everyone else suffers. I simply can't fathom why the village didn't let us be on the same team."

"Noda-chi is always talking about how the village is the best and everyone outside is scum- I have this funny feeling that Team 2 is going to make that quirk a hundred times worse. I should go hang out with her again soon. It wouldn't do to let her get TOO wound up."

>Kamiko Karatachi
"A rather accomplished medical nin. Not a lot of drama to be had here... But maybe if I get her drunk enough I could hear some juicy gossip? Feels like she'd simply detox herself before getting to that point, sadly. Either way, she's one of the more accomplished medical nin out there. I should pick her brain some time."

>Masukuda Rarime
"Cute. The only bad thing about this girl is that she's too stealthy. Getting antsy and running away isn't as funny when I can't see her. That aside, it isn't good for a young lady to go ruining her skin. The bare minimum in medical arts might be able to close the wounds, but kunoichi need to look good too! Perhaps I'll send her some kind of medical oinment. My Miko clan's healing methods are pretty good for this kind of thing... Hmm... But how to send it in a way that she'll actually use it..."

>Ichika Chinoike
"Bright, vibrant, helpful, and makes Jin's face turn the most fascinating shades. I quite enjoy having this girl in the village. Having another medical nin around to trades notes with isn't bad either. I do have to admit that I'm quite curious if there's any link to her medical arts and her curse arts. It seems like a fascinating research topic... I probably shouldn't let Jin find that one out... Or maybe I should? It could be fun."

>Kita
"He seems like a rather nice guy. It's a shame that all the bullying turned him into a bit of a doormat though. I liked it better when he tried to fight back more, both in the sense that he wasn't in the wrong and in the sense that it was more entertaining. It's always nice when morality and hobbies are in alignment. He's near the top for me in terms of other genin I like to encounter on missions. His skillset is very pragmatic and flexible, and most of all he himself is very competent."

>Kiko Inuzuka
"She truly has my condolences. Also I stand by my clan uncle that said a mere 'couple weeks' of therapy wasn't nearly enough. Even so, war is an eventuality that Konoha has to deal with from time to time, and those that brave it on the behalf of the rest are worthy of respect."

>Remilia Orochimaru
"This one's like a cute little sister. She cries a little too easily, but all the same it IS kind of fun to see people scramble to cheer her up. Like myself, she's both a potent medical nin and an accomplished poison-user... However... I can't help but wonder if she's really posessed of the right mindset to utilize the latter. Hm. Well, killing people is just part of the job in the end, so I suppose that would be an issue even without the poison... Sigh... It seems even I've fallen to the point of worrying about this girl. Truly a sinful woman."

>Itami Nanae
"Perhaps a little too obsessed with his clan and with social standing, but he seems like a fairly reliable guy. He's somewhat of a skirt-chaser, and seeing him glance over at nearby girls with the corner of his eye is rather fun. Surprising he really does have a few kunoichi that have the hots for him. Letting that go anywhere would be a bit dull however, so I try to spread rumors that he already has a woman in his life. Hopefully I'll be there in person on the day that rumor makes its way back around to him."

>Kazen Uzumaki
"...Having Kiko Inuzuka as this boy's teacher... Are the village elders trying to kill this guy? Can't they be a little more subtle about it? Regardless, he's certainly got a rather scary powerset for a genin, although his somewhat overdramatic tirades about 'change being impossible without power' or how 'he'll some day become the next sage of the six paths' makes it harder to take him seriously... What was the term? Chuunibyou?"

>Ezaki Tuto
"I... know that he exists? The rumor vine doesn't really have much on him to be honest. I haven't had the pleasure of seeing him in person either. Perhaps he's not fond of gossip."

>Jin Hyuga
"I once heard a rumor that he and the curse arts girl, Ichika were an item. It was obviously false, but I asked him about it just to see how he'd react... Ah, that was gold. I never knew a human face could contort like that. At any rate, his ideological struggles aside, Jin is one of the more reliable Genin from Konoha. He's steady, works hard, and most importantly has a good sense of humor."

>Shinrō Kamotai
"Oh, the monk? Hmm... He exists? OK, maybe that's a bit mean. He's just a bit too serious for me."

>Yuma Kouda
*Laughs "Yuma is such a precious little bean. All that confidence and no results, and she just never gives up. I don't know if she's actually a masochist or if that was just another stray rumor, but she's a little drama machine and I adore her for it. Hopefully Nod-chi doesn't succeed in killing her"

>Ghidorah
For all the Genin with these tragic backstories... How is it that this fellow is one of the most mentally sound? I mean honestly, you'd think being an orphan and a pariah would be plenty, let alone the part where he was experimented to this extent... He has my respect for the tenacity to keep trying to make friends after all that."

>Darkbone
"I... What? Who even is this sassy lost child? ...It's real!? No, you're kidding me, right? Since when was there even a 'land of pain.' This has to be that chuunibyou thing. Has to be. Next thing we know he's going to claim there's a chakra beast sealed in his eyes, fighting for control of his body."

>Taihō Shiryō.
"More than a few people are taking bets on whether he passes or not. I'm one of them. I mean, how could I not? The thing about him confessing to his crush isn't even a secret- he just swore it loudly on the edge of town hoping no one will hear him... Anyway, my money's on him passing, if only because I want the gossip that'll result from that confession."

>Ahiratsu Ōtsutsuki
"I'm not quite sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing to have this girl in the village... I suppose it's better than having her hostile? This is just one of those things it's better not to dwell on."

>Junki Takenaga
"Eh, not really too much to say. We live in very different worlds. He likes to be all tranquil in the forest. I like the village more where there's lively people to watch. He seems like a nice guy and all though."

>Sen Yamamoto
"I'd hope I don't encounter her in combat, not that I fear her as much as I fear having my position revealed. I'm not exactly a proficient combatant either, even if Sensei has been helping me round out that flaw. That aside, I'm VERY interested in this girl. She seems like a natural born wellspring of gossip. Hopefully we'll be very good friends rather than enemies."

>Tsugumi
"I've been wondering this for a long time... But there's this horoscope section in the news that's oddly accurate... Hm... Anyway, she seems to be a very knowledgeable person. I've been wanting to learn more about sensory arts anyway, so maybe I should try picking her brain at some point. When it comes to that topic, it'd be hard to find a greater expert. SHe's not much for combat however. I'm actually kind of surprised she leaves her village. Her skillset makes her extremely valuable in war time after all, so she's gotta be right up at the top in priority for assassinations. Then again, I suppose she'd just see the assassination coming and avoid it."
