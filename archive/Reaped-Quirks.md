	**Quirk:「Hijack」**

	Type: Emitter

	Description:  The ability involves seizing control of the quirks of individuals touched by commandeering their quirk factors. This grants the capacity to manipulate the behavior of the quirks, whether activating, deactivating, or regulating their output. Initial contact is necessary to hijack the target's quirk, but once established, the effect persists as long as concentration is maintained. However, should focus waver, the effect dissipates, necessitating renewed contact to regain control. In instances involving mutant-type quirks, influence can also extend to the motor functions associated with their mutant attributes.
