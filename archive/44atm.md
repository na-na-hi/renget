##### `Putting Him in His Place`
>"Honestly Kala, how many times do I have to tell you that blah blah blah..."
>Your ears instinctively perk flat to your head as you roll your eyes in annoyance. ("*ugh* Here we go again.") Honestly it's always something hubby would complain about. You know he means well, but sometimes he obsesses about everything at home.
>"... and when you take a shower, at least stand on the rugs to keep the floor dry. And would it kill you to wipe your paws when you come back home. Honestly, you blah blah blah..."
>Every week he does this, and every week we have to remind him of his place.
>While he was focused on his little rant, he could hardly react in time as you grab hold of him and swiftly but carefully drop him flat on his back.
>You sprawl over top of him, rest one leg to either side of your lover's head, and stare over your shoulder with a devious grin on your face.
>"I swear to God, Kala, don't you fucking dare..."
>Finally having enough of his pointless berating, you silence his protests by plopping down and giving him a faceful of welltoned wifwolf butt, his nose pressed firmly against your tail-hole.
>"What's that honey, I didn't quite catch that?" you tease as you begin to grind your crotch on his face.
>He begins to flail his arms in anger, lightly slapping your butt and back to try and will you off. He wasn't trying his hardest, but even if he was, not like he was strong enough to push you off. His protests are muffled from under your plump rump, the vibrations from his voice and his lips pressed against your pussy providing nice jolts of pleasure.
>After a few minutes, he finally concedes defeat. He spreads your cheeks further and got to work. His thorough tongue began to lap up your juices as it delicately traced along your folds.

>"*sigh* There you go. You know I love you dear, but after a long day like today, I'm just not in the mood for complaining. But hey, I think we finally found a good use for that smart mouth of yours."
>That earns you a firm slap to the rear.
>"Oh, you want to play rough then?" You wrap a paw around his member and give it a rough, firm squeeze. Panic sets in, he rapidly taps your butt to get you to stop as his legs began to squirm in a mixture of pleasure and pain.
>You gave a slight laugh and relented your grip. "Heh, I enjoy watching you squirm, sweetie. If you say you're sorry, I might lessen your punishment."
>He knows you can't hear him, but he still voices an apology from underneath your bottom.
>"What's that, honey?" you say as you wiggle your butt across his face. "You always tell me not to talk with my mouth full. I guess you'll have to finish your meal before you can talk."
>You weren't moving until you were completely satisfied. He knew that, so he doubled down his efforts to push you over the edge. He buried his tongue deep into your cunt, eagerly exploring every inch, causing you to gasp at the rising pleasure. With all the times you had to shut him up like this, he certainly became accustomed on how to give you a good time.
>As the pleasure grew higher and higher, you instinctively clamped your thighs around his head as your orgasm washed over you, a low post orgasm howl escaping your maw.
>You took a moment to catch your breath, finally coming down from your high. You slowly pulled yourself up and looked backdown at his completely drenched face, with a smirk adorning your own.
>"*ahem* Could you, you know?" he said, pointing to his unattended erection.
>"Honestly honey. Do you always have to keep bossing me around?"
