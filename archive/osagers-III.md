-> ┆⌞i joke about **killing people** and make **kys/die/kms jokes** sometimes!!!!! (i hold off on the kys jokes w/ most ppl tho) i also joke about **homophobia / transphobia / ableism** and make **sexual** jokes (i don't usually joke about that with strangers though!!!)⌝┆
┆⌞i might leave / stop talking randomly, please do not worry! i could be talking to my parents or having a panic attack etc and *it's better not to pry*⌝┆
┆⌞**i make romantic jokes** (about kissing ppl and stuff)⌝┆
┆⌞always tell me if something i do makes you uncomfortable!!!! i will try my hardest to stop :3⌝┆

-> ┆⌞due to my %#666666% !~[anxiety/gad](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/generalized-anxiety-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20360803) ~! %% and %#666666% !~ [rsd](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24099-rejection-sensitive-dysphoria-rsd) ~! %%, i am highly sensitive to many things and tend to overreact. *please be careful with how you speak to me and use tone tags*. please do not make jokes about things i might be sensitive to (if you're unsure, just be generally cautious about what you say), and be aware that i might misinterprate what you say. if i have an outburst at you and yell at you, it is likely because *i am having a panic attack*. i find it more difficult than others to regulate my emotions, so please do not take anything i say during a panic attack personally. it is best if you try to calm me down instead of fighting back. **do not infantalize me.** please also try to reply to me if you see no one else is, try to answer questions i ask, try to avoid critisism, i tend to panic and worry that i did something wrong. as much as this might sound really excessive, i want to feel comfortable on the internet and be able to relax. thank you :D⌝┆ <-
