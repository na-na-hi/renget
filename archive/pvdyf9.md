#Does This Spark Joy?#

*Sometime, Somewhere Aboard the Advance Notice...*

Astra's eyes softly glow as they track the various serving ladies keeping a steady supply of drinks in the hands of the ship's clientele. They did seem to be very good at their jobs, and their customers seemed pleased. If these were the experts in creating human joy then was important that she mimicked them as closely as possible.

However, that is easier said than done.

Their gait is most unusual and does not come naturally to her. It simply was not necessary for fulfilling her core functions, so she had no knowledge of how to perform it. The only option was to learn through trial and error.

There were also subtle ways in which they configured their faces and adjusted their speech. These would be even more difficult for her. She felt that she had mastered smiling, but actions such as the batting of the eyes confused her. When should she be doing it and how often? Was there a specific number that was guaranteed to bring joy? 

The answer to the latter seemed to be "no". She had counted while observing the women, and they didn't appear to adhere to any strict rule.

Still, the only course of action was to try her hand. With her shortcomings acknowledged, Astra picks out a target and begins to approach. Her free hand slides down to her hip as she tries to put a sway into her step and her smile widens even more. The target, a drowsy-looking man who just left one of the baccarat tables looking rather upset, jumps slightly as her hand grabs his shoulder and forcefully turns him around to face.

[Greetings. You do not look well.]

Before he can respond, Astra thrusts the hand holding the glass of amber liquid she was handed hours ago in front of him.

[Drink. It will make you feel better.]

"I-I don't know if-"

[I must insist that you drink. It brings humans great joy. You do desire joy, correct?]

She begins to blink rapidly while leaning forward. The man gives her a strange look and hesitantly takes the glass from her with a shaky hand. She continues to stare at him until he starts to take small sips of its contents.

[Good. You are on your path to happiness. You will not be having any heart attacks today. Now, are you interested in any of the many games that the Advance Notice has to offer? I could not help but notice that you decided to stop playing. This is unhealthy behavior, but do not worry. There are many games aboard left to try. I shall escort you to the nearest slot machine. They are very simple to operate and off quick gratification.]

The man shakes with pleasure, so excited that he almost wanders off on his own. Luckily, Astra grabs him and begins to lead him in the right direction. No matter how many they had to try and glasses they had to empty, she wouldn't let him rest until he was smiling as brightly as herself.
