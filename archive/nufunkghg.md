# New /funkg/ Hunger Games doc
HGanon left, but people wanted the games to go on, so there it is. This mostly serves to just keep track of winners.

**How the things are done**
HGs are hosted every two weeks on fridays, 10 AM EST, unless a different date has been specified.
Usually, two games are hosted at once, but the second game can be sometimes replaced with something special.
Rosters are posted 1-5 days prior to the games in the /trash/ thread.
People are also free to suggest any custom events during the game. Simply post them or reply to the host.
After the second game, submissions for the next game are open.

**Rules for submissions:**
1. Post character's picture along with their name.
2. 40 slots total.
3. Characters must be from FNF, it's mods, Newgrounds or old Flash games/movies. Up to 10 characters that don't follow this rule are allowed.
4. Submitted pictures must not contain anything NSFW or blatant fetish stuff.
5. Submissions that feature characters from default roster do not count, but you can still submit them to change their portrait (once per character).
6. Character (and their alternate versions) can win up to 3 times before getting disqualified.

**But what qualifies as "FnF"?**
To qualify, your character needs to have at least one playable custom song.
If they do not qualify, they take up the "Non-FnF" slot.
The following list clears some questionable moments:
Characters whose mod is currently in development do not qualify.
Characters featured exclusively in a reskin mod do not qualify.
Characters featured exclusively in a cover/remix of existing song do not qualify.
Background cameos do not qualify.
Mod developers do not qualify.
