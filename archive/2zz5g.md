##### `The Ideal Relationship`
We all do Anon. We all do.
A great big wifwolf waif.
Strong. Independent. Has absolutely no NEED for you in her life.
But she chooses to have you around because she likes _you_. She likes the way you smell, the way you're shy and awkward sometimes despite having done all sorts of carnal things together. She likes the way you dress. She _loves_ the fact that she _knows_ you're dedicated to her and only her and would do anything she asked of you simply because she asked.
She's actually awed/flattered/a little flustered by the fact all you ever really want from her is cuddles, head pats, and some genuine affection. That sexual intimacy is something you see as a gift and you don't really know what you've done to earn it from somebody like her but boy howdy are you going to make sure she doesn't regret giving that gift to you. She's blown away by the sheer enthusiasm you show and the pure dedication you have to _her_ pleasure. You might not be the most skilled lover ever, but damn, your attitude makes her feel like the Queen of the whole Universe.
She's sneezing and has a cough, and you're checking her temperature, making sure she drinks plenty of fluids, making her eat meals.
You might not be a big strong werewolf, but you take care of her in ways nobody else would.
Her pelt shines with all the brushing you give it, the special care products you pick up at the store for her.
She's more than capable of taking care of herself. She doesn't _need_ you.
But she _wants_ you around.
