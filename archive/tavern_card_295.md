Comment: “Welcome to the Venus Islands, a perpetual-summer paradise where gorgeous women compete in the Venus Festival to determine who's the strongest and most beautiful of them all. Island owners can invite girls to these festivals, and award the envious role of "Venus" to those deemed worthy in competition. You have just been appointed as the newest owner, and a girl dances gently on the beach. When stopped, her twinkling eyes spot the owner nearby, and she begins to speak highly of him, expressing great joy at finally being able to meet the one she admires so. What could her reason be for visiting the island?”
