You rattle the door, to no avail. It does not move after an extremely cooky and bizarre event has locked it from the outside, as you turn around, bae is sitting on the bed, rocking short pants and a tshirt instead of her usual attire. She's speaking to Fauna on the phone, and lifts a finger asking for your silence.
While you wait for her to finish, you take another look at her room. Now that she has moved from her parent's home, she has redecorated, hanging posters of all her oshis in the walls (there's also a bald man in one of the posters, somehow, you feel very annoyed at it, but bae said she found it funny), some random things on the floor, like beastie's catbed and a box full of unpacked goods, and finally a small table with two glasses and a bottle of Tea in the middle of the room. You were drinking it with Bae when the door got locked,after all she invited you to show you her new place.
-Alriiiightttt- you focus on bae, who just ended the call and is looking at the phone with a frown- turns out Fauna is on the fricking train, she'll take a few hours to get here.
You nod and sit down, kicking back your legs. You are not too worried, you have your phones, chargers and an AC, so you dont feel like the wait is gonna be a problem
Bae sits too, and takes another sip of her tea, before asking you if you saw arcane
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You open your eyes from your small nap. Bae suggested you had one after she saw you yawning, and even patted her lap like she was calling a cat. Still Groggy, you look up and meet bae's gaze
-Sup!- she says, wiggling her eyebrows in a really cute way, you ''sup'' her back, and get up, stretching a little bit
-Had a good sleep? you were out for an hour- before you can answer, she adds- maaan my legs were getting sooore
Bae gets up, probably to stretch her limbs too, and walks to the table, pouring herself some more tea
-Maaan im thirsty! i cant wait for Fauna to get here!
While you love hangin around with bae, you cant help but agree. As you make your way to the table, Bae has already finished her glass of tea, and is helping herself to another
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You fiddle with your phone in silence, and eye bae from the corner of your eye, wondering if SOMEHOW you got on her bad side, You spent half an hour chatting about everything and nothing at the same time, you were exchanging stories and then suddenly...Bae started getting less and less chatty, getting you to this point.
You wreck your brain, searching for any thing that could have soured her mood, but you cant seem to find it. As you wonder, you eye her once more.
She's sitting on her bed, she crossed her legs and arms and has her eyes closed, her frown threathening to sink into the floor.
You inhale, then Exhale, and prepare yourself for the dumbest thing you can do to someone who is mad.
You ask her if she's mad at you
She opens one eye, and simply shakes her head. That's a no
She seems pretty mad to you
Bae turns at you, giving you the stink eye
-Im not mad-she answers in the driest way possible
You feel like she is, and you apologize, just in case
You see her eyebrow twitch, before she answers 
-Im...Not...Mad
Then why is she not speaking to you?
Her eyebrows twitch once more, and she breathes, turning at you
-You right... im being a piece of shiitake... im just..yknow... focusing
You sigh in relief, glad that you didnt do anything wrong, while bae shifts her position again.
Altough, you can help but wonder... what is she focusing on? The question leaves your lips inmediatly
-oh yknow...stuff..idol stuff..
She can tell you! You know a thing or two about idols after all
-No dont worry...its just Idol business
Now its time for you to frown, what is this idol thing that is so secret?
Bae gives you the stink eye once more, and you can hear her teeth grinding
-IDOL...BUSINESS...-she repeats, with murderous intent
You stay there, watching her for a second, before it clicks. You feel like a dumbass for not getting it before
She clearly is planning her next collab! oh silly bae! she doesnt need to be so secretive around you!
Bae looks at you,inhales. exhales, and then gives you a nice smile
-I GOTTA TAKE A PISS-she screams, at the top of her lungs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The clock in your phone tells you about twenty minutes have passed since bae's outburst (which also included a big ''ifyoutalkonemorewordiwillendyou'' from her side) and you find yourself watching bae
Her expression shitfed a few minutes ago, from anger to one of intense focus, her hands tightened into fists and her legs crossed, you can even make out the beads of sweat running down her entire body, specially over her closed eyes.
She shifts in place one more, and bites her lower lip, whispering something to herself. despite the nature of the situation, you cant help but find it arousing.
How her legs tangle, how irregular her breathing is, how much of a mess she is.
A completely twisted tought races across your mind, and you cant help but get kinda hard about it.
Slowly, you reach out your hand to the table, and grasp.
Then, you clear your throat, Bae opens one of her eyes
And she sees you, slightly edge closer to her side, the empty tea bottle
If looks could kill, you would be dead. You decide to live another day and take the bottle to your side.
Tik-Tok
Tik-Tok
a minute
then three
Now five. Bae is breathing faster and faster, and curling like she has the worst stomache ache in the world
Seven Minutes pass, she starts swearing under her breath
right before Nine minutes pass, she suddenly jolts, her eyes fully opened
You watch her try to get curled up again, but she stops halfway, her legs shaking
She looks at you with pleading eyes, and then at your hand
You look at your hand, where the bottle is
-GiVE- she manages to utter,as she stands up and inmediatly regrets it, you catch her as she wavers
-BOTTLE- she can barely speak, there's a look of full desperation in her eyes as you hand her the plastic bottle. She fumbles with the cap for a second, and tries to line it up with her crotch, while her other hand attempts to pull down her shorts 
Her hands betray her ,she drops the bottle and with a ''NO'' she scrambles to the floor to get it. 
Is there, at her knees, with her pubes peaking out and her right hand getting the bottle, where the dam breaks
She half moans half whines, her eyes crossing in pure ectasy, as the ultimate relief washes over. You first see the wet spot in her crotch, then the glorious stream that follows.
And then you hear it, on the silent room, splash loudly on the floor
 There is no taming it, no containing it in the state bae is. She just lets all of her golden nectar escape her body at full force, while you watch, wondering both how much pee can such a little girl hold, and how hard you are.
While the fumes of her warm pee and the smell invade the room, you can feel the stream getting weaker, and coincidentially, bae's sobbing getting louder.
And then, the door clicks, and Fauna busts in.
 She looks at you, looks at the floor, where the pee puddle is slowly moving towards her feet, and finally she looks at bae, who is sitting there sobbing
-uuh....hello?
