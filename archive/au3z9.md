Name: Jacob (Jake) Wellman
Face: Jake is best described as "Golden Retriever puppy" in terms of his face. Happy, eager, and a good heart. He also has a scar cutting vertically from his right eyebow down to the bottom of his lower right eye lid
Hair: Jake's hair is a lush, slightly longer forest of golden blonde hair that he parts down the middle, with an errant strand that hangs down slightly, just above his left eye
Eyes: Jake's eyes are a deep piercing blue.
Height: Jake is tall. He's 6'4" by imperial measurement, 193cm in metric.
Bodytype: Jake is very physically fit. As a lover of sports, Jake has the build of a typical athlete for his age and size. Moreso very well defined muscle and actual muscle bulk.
Complexion: Other than the aforementioned scar across Jake's right eye, his complexion is that of a young man who spends time outdoors. Slightly tanned with a near imperceptible smattering of freckles just across his upper cheeks.
Uniform variation: Jacob's uniform (see attached pic) is slightly more fancy than average. His house robe features twin bands of crimson on each sleeve at the wrist, and his uniform under the cloak is grey checkered slacks, a white dress shirt, a grey vest, and a red checkered jacket with gold pattern lines.

Voice: Confident and with a typical British accent of someone who grew up in close proximity to Oxford.
Body language: Jacob tends to talk with his hands, a trait he picked up from his Father. He stands tall and confidently and has a very relaxed pose when he's with good friends. If he is in a relationship, he tends to take a protect stance when out in public with his partner.
Social: Jacob is extremely social and extroverted. He's always felt comfortable in any group and is known to make friends fairly quickly. So far, his closest friend is likely Matthew, the Gryffindor Quidditch Captain, as they have bonded over their love of the sport. He's flirted here and there with a few female students (Penny, Ioni) but nothing more than harmless friendly flirting. It's not that he isn't looking for love or a partner, he just hasn't found one yet.
Visibility: As one of the tallest students, Jacob definitely stands out in a crowd.
Engagement: He's likely to come up and chat if the conversation he overhears has anything to do with sports. He's always happy to give advice or trivia about sports if other students ask him.
Quirks: Jacob is just happy when he's useful. He likes being helpful, no matter what kind of help his fellow students may need.
Things your character wouldn't do: Jacob would never bully anyone. Sure he's a jock, but he's a kind jock. He would also never willingly take a life or cause harm to anyone unless they deserved his wrath through evil acts.
Animals: Jacob has an average relationship with animals. He had a pet dog growing up and he brought a big Barn Owl to Hogwarts as his pet.
