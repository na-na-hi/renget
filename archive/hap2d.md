Personality blurb :)
Name: Smith
Species: Skorupi
sex: Male
(personality isn't 100% set in stone and is subject to change if i feel like it, im still developing this character and my writing techniques. If you ask nicely, then other anons are allowed and even encouraged to use him in their stories. I'd love to see other anon's takes on his dialogue, personality, etc, and i'd be willing to incorporate it into future work.)

>Keeps to himself, usually speaks only when spoken to, and keeps his sentences brief, until he gets comfortable, then is more willing to unwind.
>Is concerned about his image, he tries to blend in and keep his thoughts to himself.
>Remembers culture and memes from the human world, but tries to avoid bringing it up, to not make himself look like a dumbass.
>Tends to swear frequently without realizing and speak absentmindedly in casual conversation. Much more professional and polite speech mannerisms around strangers/superiors.
>Enjoys fighting. Wants to become "overpowered". (Nobody knows exactly what that entails)
>Despite having grand ambitions, he's susceptible to becoming anxious and sometimes overwhelmed in unfamiliar or stressful situations.
>Tries to stay quiet and composed, but when irritated/stressed starts losing his composure.
>Won't normally try to start fights or provoke people, but is willing to accept challenges from others.
>Picks his battles. Is not afraid to refuse a fight against someone he expects to be outclassed by. However, he won't try to escape a fight that's already started.
>Skilled fighting adept. His knowledge of Pokemon anatomy and type matchups lends him to be able to defeat stronger foes, to an extent.
>Below average skill at navigation, puzzle solving, resource management, and other crucial aspects of dungeon exploration.
>Despite this, he's willing to assist guild members on their expeditions... if there's a reward for him.
