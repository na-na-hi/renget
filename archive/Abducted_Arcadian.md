*Beep. Beep. Beep*
Your alarm rings out, bringing your sweet dreams to a halt. Your eyes adjusting to the uncomfortably pale lights of the station, you get up, preparing for another day of work. The I.S.S. is a huge station, with many wings dedicated solely to the furthering of science and preservation of alien life. As a live in crew member, your work days are long and arduous. With poor pay and employee benefits, anybody else would've left long ago, headed back to whatever podunk planet they came from. Not you, other worlds have always fascinated you, the constant contact with alien species was exactly what you've always wanted to see. Foreign life was always oddly interesting to you, their anatomy to the way they functioned as species. With your standard uniform on, you leave your small quarters.

Making your way to the main console of the wing, you key in your arrival time and prepare a workstation, the desk already lined up with your work from the previous day. The worst part of this job was how every day played out the same, due to strict non disclosure agreements, you couldn't even have proper chats with your workmates beyond your boss. Even so, you couldn't spend any time with him due to his own ridiculous workload. It was a taxing job to say the least, and you were almost sick of it. Your work involves identifying the antibodies of an alien life that may be useful in the creation of new vaccines against a virus sweeping various planets. Just as you begin to get into the swing of work, the Station's lights shut off.

"ATTENTION, Code - 395-b, Major hull damage detected." The AI's monotone voice rings out, no doubt an evacuation order was about to be given. Leaving your desk behind, you make for the 2nd deck, taking the stairs. Reaching the top, you bump into someone, "Sorry, it's kinda hard to see..." you mumble out. The figure, silhouetted by the emergency lights stands up, is clearly not human. Space Pirates. A pit forms in your stomach as it sinks it's claws into you, dragging you along for what seems like ages, until your thrown to the ground. Sickly green light emits from ship's interior, docked to what you assume is the hull breach. The pirate lets out some unintelligible clicks with it's alien mandibles, presumably telling it's crew they have a hostage. A lone shadow forms in the ship, slowly moving closer. It's draconic shape you've seen before in reports, but where? It comes closer to you, towering above as it's heavy breath rings in your ears.

"Human, I require your assistance."
"M-me?"
"Yes, this is the medical wing, no?"
His voice is raspy, as if on the verge of succumbing, cautiously, you stand up, hands raised in submission.
"Yes, it is, if I help you, will you do no harm to the others on board?"
"If you do what I ask, to the letter, then you have my word."

Unconsciously, you swallow, terrified of what this might entail. You give in to him, surely keeping the rest of the station safe is of more importance than your own safety, besides, it's not like you absolutely loved it here. Something about him, despite the situation, made you feel as though you could trust him to keep that promise. His digit beckons you to follow onto his ship, his crew of space pirates joining him. Was he the only one who could speak English? The ship's doors closing just as you make your way in, you shiver at this unfamiliar scenery. The reptilian creature grabs your wrist, pulling you along, taking you into a separated area of the vessel. Gathering your surroundings, you realize this is most likely his quarters, the lighting here while dim, didn't have that distinctive green pigment the others did. 

"I'm impressed, not many would offer themselves sacrifice to a bunch of pirates."
"Well, I don't imagine you'd have just let me go."
"You're quite right in that regard. Now, here's what's important." 
He slides his hands along a control panel, the lights no longer dimmed, you finally take in his visage. It was Ridley, no doubt about it, you'd heard about the Space Pirate many times, how ruthless he was, how many he'd killed. As you looked closer though, you could tell his body was in poor shape, his purple scales covered in tears, parts of his flesh exposed. You couldn't believe the sight.

"How are you alive!? Your body is practically in pieces!"
"Hah, that's what you're shocked by? Well, now you know why we decided to take a medic such as yourself."
"What!? I can't do much about this, I haven't got any supplies or a fabricator to make implants with."
"Well, there's plenty on this ship for that, and if you need motivation, how's about a ship full of pirates who don't speak your tongue. Pirates who'll kill you the moment they realize you let their leader die."
Your stomach sinks as you realize your predicament is much worse than you'd ever thought. Your head races as you try to think of what would be needed to deal with these injuries.
"Can I use your terminal? I need to know how deep these injuries go and what I'll need to treat them."
"Very well, it's over there in the corner, I've had the computer do a full check of my body already."

Upon accessing the device, you're greeted with folders haphazardly strewn around, you quickly scroll through to the medical section, paying no mind to anything else. The charts aren't a good sign, he's in critical condition, his internal organs haven't received any lasting damage, but his bones are almost dust. You stare back at him, his amethyst form lounging on his bed, you needed to keep him from doing any strenuous activity. Writing up a short list, you note that you'll need to give various bio-mechanical implants to him, if he's to do anything active. That at least would prevent further damage, his body would also have less stress placed upon it, allowing for quicker recovery. Turning to him proper, you quietly stride to his reclined form, coughing to get his attention.

"Well, doc' give it to me straight."
"You have 45 broken bones, 80 fractured bones and severe tissue damage, I frankly can't believe you were standing at all."
"My kind are built strong, takes a hell of a lot to do this much damage."
"Well, I'm going to need a lot of material to create an exoskeleton to keep your body from straining itself in the recovery process. That's if you want to keep moving around until you're healed"
"Fine, there should be plenty of scrap on the deck, along with a fabricator."
"I'll also need to measure you, do you have-"
"Yeah, there's a scanner there on the counter."

Grabbing the scanner, you turn to the space dragon, eyeing up his form under the guise of measuring. The tool doing all the work, you simply stare at his body, never having been so close to an alien. You do everything in your power to keep from touching him there, ever so curious of his foreign biology, you stare what feels a moment too long at his crotch. A heat rising inside you, you manage to keep it in your pants until the scanner dings, signalling the completion of his measurement. Excusing yourself from his private room, you pause to gather yourself. Were you really ogling that monster? His bony body, his scaly skin, that deep voice, his piercing eyes...

Work goes quickly on the fabrication of his exo-suit, the joints functioning close enough to humans, you needn't worry about adjusting much beyond proportion. With a day's work, you're practically ready for the suit to be built, needing only help loading in the raw material, you head to Ridley's cabin once more. Cautiously, you step inside, scared not only of the creature, but your own feelings and perception of him. Were you crazy? You've heard what he's done through bulletins, he is one of the most wanted people in the entire galaxy. Yet, you can't help but find his form strangely... seductive.

"Ah, if it isn't my new companion, what brings you back so soon?"
"It's been 9 hours, I finished the schematics, I just needed someone to load the material into the fabricator."
"Excellent, I didn't expect to get such a crack scientist, and not one who'd so willingly submit to me. I'll get a couple of my guys to do that later."
Your heart pounds in your chest, were you just misinterpreting him or was he trying to push your buttons?
"Y-yes, well, I'd like to ask if there's any place I could rest, I've got nothing else to do."
"How about you sit with me, human, I've got something to ask you"
Nervously, you pace up to his bed, setting yourself down on the edge next to him. Biting your tongue, you finally decide to ask, "What is it?"
"Why are you so excited by my body?"

Your heart sinks, did he notice you staring? did he have some way to tell? His expression shifts perceptibly, cocky as can be. "Is it my voice? My size? Perhaps you're into the danger you feel you're in when you stare at my body?" You feel his boney finger poke under your shirt, his nail jabbing into you as he drags it along your back. Your body involuntarily shivers, you know he could at any moment utterly tear you to shreds. "I've hit the nail on the head haven't I? You like this feeling of helplessness don't you?" He grips at your waist, pulling you closer before whispering into your ear, "Well, I think I could humor your little fetish, if only for the night."

As you try to protest, he lifts you in front of himself, your body now against his. "Come, no need to say a word, it's writ all over you." His skeletal hand reaches down, pulling your garments off. As your naked body presses against him, you feel the heat in his skin, almost overwhelming in it's strength. Just as you grow used to this warmth, a new sensation touches you. Against your own hardness, you feel Ridley's member snaking out ever so slowly, almost sinisterly pressing into you. Too afraid to push off of him, you let him gently play with your body, his sharp talons running over you like water. He gently flicks at your nipple, eliciting a moan, he chuckles, hoarsely but deliberate. He's already in your head, working out how to push your buttons, whether it's to make you his or as some kind of sick joke, you have no idea.

Slowly, he pulls you up, bringing your face to the end of his violet snout. "Now, my dear physician, I'm going to give you my thanks in full." His husky voice making you shudder, he gently prods his tapered cock against your hole. His length slick, it's warmth slips against your entrance, teasing you so. Nervously, you reach down to your behind, eliciting a smile from him as you spread yourself. He coils his tail around you gently, bringing you closer again before kissing you. His tongue pries your mouth open, diving into you, feeling it probe and explore you, moaning around his intruding organ. With a quick buck of his hips, your draconic partner's entire dick is sheathed inside of you.

The feeling is overwhelming, how large he is, you feel your body stretching around him. You can do nought but moan into him as he continues his two pronged assault of your helpless figure. Ever so slowly, he starts to thrust into you, breaking the kiss to watch you. "Good boy." His continuous humps into your rear, while slow, remain ever so forceful, reminding you exactly of his strength as he drives himself into you. Taking his time, it's not long before he realises the exact angle which elicits the most moans from you. His tip batters your prostate with each thrust, practically forcing you to the edge. "Cum for me, I know you want to." At his order, you're spent, your seed spraying over his mauve body, slicking his body with your desire.

"Good, I'm not going to hold back any more." With those words, he rolls over, mounting you, his tail tightening around your waist. As you brace yourself, he begins waging war on your behind. The bed shaking with the force of each violent thrust into your hole, you feel his fingers intertwine with yours. His head craning next to yours, he whispers into your ear, "I might have to keep you around here." You feel on the verge of tearing open as he finally thrusts into you one last time, his hips against your ass. Your asshole now packed to the brim with alien cock, he lets loose inside of you. You feel a constant stream of his cum filling your body, enough so that you worry there may be too much. Before it grows uncomfortably full, he pulls out, a wet splatter as he stains the sheets with his otherworldly seed.

He continues to paint the sheets for a moment, until his orgasm finally ebbs, letting out a loud yawn, he rolls back to his spot, reclining.
"Well, that was wonderful, I could tell you loved it every bit as much as I did."
"R-Ridley, that wasn't a great idea... what if you'd strained yourself?"
"I'm a lot tougher than you humans are, if anything you should be worried I didn't break your hip."
Letting out a hearty chuckle, you relent, cuddling up to his bony form.
"Fine... where you serious about keeping me with you?"
"Well, it's not like the I.S.S. is going to take you back after aiding a wanted criminal, is it?"
