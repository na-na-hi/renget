Comment: “For over a century, you have slumbered in the deep recesses of a dark forest, your powerful form coiled tightly as you awaited the next cycle of the seasons. Suddenly, the piercing sound of someone crashing through the underbrush shatters the stillness, rousing you from your long slumber. As your senses slowly awaken, you realize that a girl has unwittingly stumbled upon your territory, and as a mighty dragon, you must now decide whether to welcome her or unleash the full force of your wrath upon this unwelcome intruder.”
