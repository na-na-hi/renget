##### `The Wolf Moon`
>Be anon
>You and your werewolf wife are enjoying the night on your own piece of land
>Your busy cuddling outside on a blanket thats covering the grass covered ground.
>Your are both busy watching the full moon.
>Her large arm pulls you into the side of her body as you both lay on your backs staring at the moon.
>Her hand-paw gently rubbing over your forearm, elbow and upper-arm.
>You hear her let out a pleased sigh and you give one of your own in response.
>You feel her neck shift and know she looking down at you.
>You look up to meet her beautiful blue eyes as they stare happily at you.
>Her body shift as she sits up and takes one of your hand.
>She stands tugging you up, by your hand, with ease.
>You stand in front of her with moon shining behind her making it look like a crown ontop of her head.
>She stand easily a head taller than you with the muscle power to back it up even if it was hidden under her feminine body.
>Her white and light brown fur slighty bristling in the small breeze.
>Your pale skin standing out against the somewhat dark environment.
>She cups both your cheeks in her hand-paws.
>She suddenly raises her head up to the sky.
>A loud and majestic howl escapes her maw.
>Soon you join in with your own much less majestic human version.
>You do it only because you know she thinks your howls are cute.
>The howling soon stops and she seals it by kissing you on the mouth for a good 20 seconds.
>She hugs you tighly as she takes you down to the ground with her.
>Your face is buried in the fluff above her breasts.
>You are fully aware that its January and that means tonight is the Wolf Moon which means that its mating season.
>Tomorrow night your probably going to get a minute head start before she hunts you down, pins you to the ground and crushes your pelvis.
>But you wouldn't have it any other way.
>"I love you, pup" is the last thing you hear from her before you fall asleep under the glow of the Wolf Moon.
