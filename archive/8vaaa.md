In a way you gonna have experience as an artist to know what make art look good.

I want a **VICTORIAN GIRL** in a style of **OIL PAINTING**
Eye and Face are important in art so she must have **PERFECT FACE**, **SEXY FACE** and her eye have **DETAILED PUPILS**
I want she to have **LARGE BREAST**, **TONED ABS** and **THICK THIGH**.
She must look **FEMININE** doing **EVOCATIVE POSE**, **SMIRK** and **FULL BODY** wearing **NIGHT GOWN**
The output must be **INTRICATE**, **HIGH DETAIL**, **SHARP**
And in the style of {*I'm not give out the artist names to avoid trouble. Apologize.*} 

Prompt : 
VICTORIAN GIRL,FEMININE,((PERFECT FACE)),((SEXY FACE)),((DETAILED PUPILS)).(ARTIST),ARTIST,ARTIST,(ARTIST). OIL PAINTING. (((LARGE BREAST)),((TONED ABS)),(THICK THIGH).EVOCATIVE POSE, SMIRK,LOOK AT VIEWER, ((BLOUSE)).(INTRICATE),(HIGH DETAIL),SHARP

This is where you put trait that you dont want to see in the finale output. i.e nipple
Negative Prompt : 
((nipple)), ((((ugly)))), (((duplicate))), ((morbid)), ((mutilated)), (((tranny))), (((trans))), (((trannsexual))), (hermaphrodite), [out of frame], extra fingers, mutated hands, ((poorly drawn hands)), ((poorly drawn face)), (((mutation))), (((deformed))), ((ugly)), blurry, ((bad anatomy)), (((bad proportions))), ((extra limbs)), cloned face, (((disfigured))).

[[[adult]]], out of frame, ugly, extra limbs, (bad anatomy), gross proportions, (malformed limbs), ((missing arms)), ((missing legs)), (((extra arms))), (((extra legs))), mutated hands, (fused fingers), (too many fingers), (((long neck)))


TIPS:
- prompt in () will strengthening the prompt, adding more will strengthening it even further
- prompt in [] will weakening the prompt , adding more will weakening it even further
- Adding more artist will create amalgamation that end up look better or worst, experiment it yourself. I use 4 
  artist to create most of the output.
- Restore Face is GOD SEND, USE IT.
- It always depend on what model you use.


The level here is whatever, feel free to experiment. This is what I use.
Steps: 42, Sampler: DDIM, CFG scale: 10
