##### `Like a Bitch in Heat`
>You're dating a werewolf.
>She's got enough mastery of her lycanthropy that she can transform back and forth with her mind intact.
>But every full moon, when she involuntarily transforms, she still insists on being alone.
>You figure it would not be an issue and say you're not afraid of her,
>She goes red in the fact and with great embarrassment, finally explains.
>She's not afraid of hurting you, she just doesn't want you to see how much of a dumb mutt she becomes.
>The werewolf aggression may be gone, but it was replaced with a dumb, horny dog.
>Your gf recounts how she spent a good 15 minutes barking at nothing one time because she thought the echo of her own bark was another wolf. When it finally hit her, she stopped and rubbed her werewolf cookie on anything vaguely phallic. She then mistook her own human scent on a shirt to be a competing female and barked at noting again.
>You felt really bad for laughing, honest.

>You let yourself into her house on the night of the full moon.
>She smells you instantly and beelines for you, knocking you over.
>You're held in a tight hug as she licks your face, or at least the top half of your face, the part not buried in her furry breasts.
>You take a deep breath, feeling your face blush and dick suddenly going erect.
>Holy shit. Fem werewolves naturally smell somewhat pleasant due to some magic pheromone fuckery. Normally a human nose can't pick up much, but THIS scent makes your head swim with lewd thoughts
>In your lap, you can feel both her tail wagging a mile a minute and her hot vulva drooling onto your now painfully tight pants.
>Your lover suddenly stops and disengages, her nose sniffing the air. She follows her nose right down to your crotch, sniffing the tent you've pitched as she begins to shake in anticipation. Behind her, her tail stills and flags.
>On all fours, she turns and presents herself in all her puffy, needy glory, a low whine telling you to quit admiring and hurry up.
>Well, you're not about to tell a 7'2" werewolf "no".
