##Zheng Hao

**Tao - Action, Physician Tao**
This is the Tao of being a Physician. More than just a mere Healer's Tao, or a Medicine Tao, this is Zheng Hao's belief in his skills as a doctor. Not merely striving to heal others, nor staking everything on the power of medicines created, this is the path of refining one's ability to heal, one's knowledge about the body, and the practice of these things to achieve a skill that can bear the fruit of 'Defeating Death'. Ultimately, as any other, this is a path to spurn the Heavens by achieving not only the ability to save one's self from the natural order, but to deliver such onto others as well.

**Philosophy - Mortal**

**Generation - Disciple**

**Qi Gathering - Tao Talent, Exotic Spirit Root
Body Tempering - Crippled
Soul Refining - Mortal Talent**

**Taoist Roots - Scholarly Sect
Circumstances - Steep Decline**
Zheng Hao originates from a Physician's sect, focused on the healing arts and knowledge of the body to further health and cultivation. Once a great sect, this Seven Clouds Medicine School in the modern day is... definitely not that any more. A pathetic shadow of a sect, it housed only a handful of students, and the strength of its Elders has grown less and less with recent generations. Pushed and shouldered out of territory, resources, and recruits by other nearby sects, the Seven Clouds Medicine School had dwindled to irrelevance by the time Zheng Hao joined it.

Yet, by his third year in attendance, the school's situation grew infinitely worse, as an unknown group of assailants stormed the school, slaughtering elders and disciples alike, rampaging through the sect, before departing, with many of the school's remaining treasures and scrolls destroyed or stolen, and over half of the population killed.

Zheng Hao was severely injured during this attack, barely hanging on to life due to his unique physique. However, the damage to his body was too great to be repaired, even the remaining elders of the school could only help Zheng Hao recover his life. After months of recovery, Zheng Hao was finally released and allowed to continue as an Outer Disciple of the sect, but that wasn't enough for Zheng Hao any more, not after what he saw and experienced first hand.

With the Seven Clouds Medicine School now on the verge of dissolution, Zheng Hao had to turn to the outside world, searching far and wide to find some way to rejuvenate his sect.

**Life Encounters- Life Saving Grace, Nameless Heroics, Budding Romance**

**Fated Encounter- Immortal Physique, Five Elements in Unison**
Zheng Hao was born with the unique physique known in some ancient texts as 'Five Elements in Unison', or the 'Five Elements Flow'. While it seems simple on the surface, merely being attuned to each of the five elements, its might and mystery are truly profound below the surface. Each element can control and empower another of the five, leading to a mutual flow, creating a generative power unlike that most can achieve, while opposing elements can be extinguished, granting unmatched potential to control outside energies.

**Fighting Style- Other (Finger), Claw
Comprehension- Immortal Grade**
Zheng Hao primarily fights with finger techniques, attacking meridians and pressure points, or enhancing his striking power through the medium of Qi to achieve a more aggressive hard style, which is well suited to his anatomical knowledge due to his skill as a physician.

However, while this is his focus, there is a darker side to his fighting style. Having witnessed true slaughter and death, a darker side to his skills can be utilized. Should his usual style fail him, Zheng Hao can reveal vicious and terrifying claw techniques, brutal in their precision and ruthlessness - However, this way of fighting leads to a dangerous balancing act for Zheng Hao, whose Tao seems near-diametrically opposed to these methods.

The most important techniques that Zheng Hao practises are the Five Elements Meridian-Strengthening Manual, of course, and the Five Elements Internal Classic. The latter is the complete medicinal text of the Seven Clouds Medicine School, detailing the entirety of their physician's arts. The Five Elements Meridian-Strengthening Manual is derivative of that medicinal text, and is five different cultivation techniques, one specialized for each element, that have been fused into a singular art to suit Zheng Hao's unique spirit root through his own innovation and exploration of each technique's concepts. These five techniques are the 'Vital Forest Meridian-Strengthening Manual', 'Burning Furnace Meridian-Strengthening Manual', 'Great Mountain Meridian-Strengthening Manual', 'Golden Essence Meridian-Strengthening Manual', and 'Flowing River Meridian-Strengthening Manual'.

Following this are the mainstay arts of his combat style, each a finger technique focusing on the manipulation of a particular element.
The Vital Flow Single Point is the primary technique of the Seven Clouds Medicine School, focusing on directing or disrupting the vital essence of the Wood element to nurture health and promote recovery. As a combat technique, it is used to disrupt the vital life essence of an enemy, striking directly through their body without regard for physical toughness, instead constraining an opponents life force through their vital energy.
The Burning Yang Finger utilizes the concepts of energy and vigor, heat and agitation to dispel lethargy and burn away impurities. As a combat technique, it is one of the more direct methods, directly utilizing external heat concentrated into a tight scalpel of white-hot flame with explosive results.
The Eight Meridian Golden Strike encompasses the qualities of clarity and sharpness, helping to ensure clear breath and cut through a patient when necessary. As a combat technique, it is almost entirely external, aiming to cause crippling wounds and puncture through to vulnerable areas of the body.
The Mountain-Weight Finger Technique is used to bring stability to a patient, enriching the muscles and encouraging strength. As a combat technique, it aims to exert this characteristic strength and weight, allowing the practitioner to fight from a stable position and avoid being overwhelmed, damaging the muscles of an opponent and restricting their ability to exert their own force.
The Flowing River Vessel Disruption controls the flow of qi within a patient, washing the bones and aiding in the prevention of qi deviation during treatment. As a combat art, it uses this principle to directly attack the vessels of an enemy, interfering with the proper flow of qi and distorting an opponent's control.

Next are the secondary techniques of the Seven Cloud Medicine School. 
Swan Wings Unfold is a graceful technique, allowing for efficient and smooth movements with little strain, while the Roots of the Earth is a technique drawing on the stability and durability of elemental earth in order to instill solidity and stamina, useful not only for reducing damage taken by its user but providing relief from the strain of prolonged action.
The Meridian Pulse Sensory Art is one of the more prized techniques of the Seven Cloud Medicine School, and one of the few technique scrolls that weren't stolen in the raid of the sect. It is a skill that detects the pulse of life through the qi in the organs. While it grants a user heightened awareness of living beings in their surroundings, its true use lies in the diagnosis of bodily ailments, allowing near-effortless reading of a living being's status through a thorough pulse reading, synchronizing the user's own qi and essence to that of the target's.

The remaining techniques known and used by Zheng Hao are those picked up during his travels, or intuited based on his own observations.

The Blazing Flame Steps are rather straightforward, relying on the energetic and chaotic nature of elemental fire to infuse the practitioner's steps with that same nature, allowing changes in direction and movement with incredible ease. It's top speed is nothing impressive, but its acceleration and deceleration are top notch within its grade.

The Cold Yin Heart-Severing Bone Claw is a derivation of the claw technique that killed Zheng Hao's mentor. Developed in the years since that night, it has culminated into a dark killing art utilizing a perverse inversion of the five elements flow to achieve an otherworldly energy that denies life. Upon initiating this attack, a cold purple flame ignites around the user's hand, which drains and consumes life energy, leaving blackened, dead, burning wounds which reject all but the most powerful of restorative energies. Unfortunately, due to its unnatural and incomplete nature, this also affects the wielder, dealing immense damage to themself even when only initiating the technique.

Finally, a technique only named, crudely, 'Conquer Death'. This technique encompasses Zheng Hao's will, ambition, and all of his Tao. Drawing on all five elements from the world around, the user utilizes medical knowledge to direct this energy into a potent curative force, regenerating wounds and injuries in a powerful torrent, completely rejecting death with constant reinforcement. However, this flow only lasts for a short period of time, and leaves the user void of energy and vigor in its wake, putting a harsh clock on the fight after its activation.
