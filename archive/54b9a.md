\>It’s been almost 200 years since the bombs fell
\>Almost 200 years since the great civilizations decided to destroy the world
\>Many claimed it would be the end of humanity
\>The end of everything
\>But humans, the ever-tenacious pest they are, still cling to life
\>Etching out a new niche in the irradiated wasteland
\>You, like many others, found traveling caravans to be the best means for survival
\>You’ve been part of yours for as long as you can remember
\>Traveling around, trading goods for those ever-precious caps
\>It’s a good life, or at least as close to one as you can imagine
\>You have a means to feed yourself
\>Frequent interaction with other travelers
\>And protection offered by the caravan guards
\>One day, you and your traveling crew get a request from a scientist
\>He wants you to transport a few rare pre-war trinkets to his colleague in Wheelersburg
\>Offers two hand-picked guards as protection
\>Seems standard enough, you’ve done deliveries like these countless times before
\>You set off with the pair through the wasteland, making good progress as you cross irradiated plains, desolate townships, and once lush riverbeds, now left dry in cracking in the sun
\>At the end of the third day, the guards convince you to settle down for the night on a small hill overlooking a lake
\>Seems like a good spot, it gives them both ample views to keep watch
\>As you drift off to sleep, you wonder what the town of Wheelersburg is like
\>You’ve heard they have a still working carousel, whatever the hell that is
\>You’re awoken by the sound of laughter, and feeling something prod against your side
\>You open your eyes to find a man, covered in animal skins poking at your side with the barrel of a gun
\>The guards and your brahmin are nowhere to be found
\>Your best guess is that the guards made off with your stash in the dead of night, leaving you alone and at the mercy of whoever would stumble across you
\>Such as this small group of bandits, eager to have a new prize they can sell into slavery for some caps
\>Not wanting to have your brains blown out, you comply with their demands, and are escorted even further out into the wastes
\>After a several days of hiking, your exhausted, famished, and not sure if you could travel any farther
 \>Hoping to rest themselves, the band finds a cave and decide to sleep there for the night while they gather food
\>Knowing this is deathclaw territory, you try to argue this is a bad idea, but are quickly silenced by a pistol whip to the temple
\>From your time with them, you can tell these are some young upstarts within their bandit clan, eager to make a name for themselves, but woefully inexperienced
\>You’re just afraid they’re going to get you all killed
\>One in particular seems too curious for his own good, and convinces himself to go explore the deeper portions of the cave
\>While he tells his friends he’ll be gone for just a few minutes, an hour ticks by with no sign of him
\>Anxious, another follows after him into the cave
\>He is not gone for nearly as long, bolting out from the dark cavern screaming about a horrifying, pale monster
\>In hot pursuit is that monster, a large pale deathclaw quite angry that its home was disturbed
\>You had heard of these creatures, and the threat they pose, but never seen one in person before
\>Certainly, never this close for comfort
\>The other bandits, not aware of the danger they find themselves in and looking for a fight, charge the beast with gun and spears in hand
\>Those that are not ripped apart by its claws and teeth, rush out from the cave in a mad flee for safety
\>While you’d want nothing more than to run as well, your body, so overworked and famished, refuses to move
\>After dealing with the bandits, the deathclaw sets its sights onto you
\>You’re in no state to fight back against such a hulking monstrosity, or even run, so you decide to close your eyes and hope that it finishes you off quickly
\>As you sit there, helpless, you feel it press its face close to yours, its warm breath blowing onto your head 
\>You can hear it open its jaws, an expect it clamp down onto your skull with its razor-sharp teeth
\>Instead, you are surprised by the sound that emerges from its throat
\>”Safe now”
\>It…can talk
\>The mixture of physical exhaustion, abject fear, and outright befuddlement finally take their tole on you, and you feel your mind grow hazy as you pass out, body slumping onto the floor with a light thud
\>You awake after an unknown amount of time to find several opened cans of beans laid out in front of you, food peeking out from the lids
\>Normally you’d question how these got here, but the need for food drives you forward as you pounce on the cans, devouring each in a matter of moments
\>You were so enthralled by the food, that is not until the last delicious morsel is swallowed that you realize your benefactor is sitting across from you on the other side of the cave
\>The same pale deathclaw, laying on his side in a quite relaxed state
\>”Food good?” it inquires
\>You are unable to answer, frozen in place as you stare back at the beast
\>”Bandits gone. You rest”
\>Again, you remain like a deer in headlights
 \>The creature reaches out to you, its muscles rippling through its heavy plating of scales as it points a massive curved claw at your much smaller, much more delicate frame
\>”I protect”


\>Over the next few days, the deathclaw does just that, allowing you to stay in its cave for shelter as it travels out into the wilds to gather food for the two of you
\>You are treated to a wide range of options, ranging from more canned goods, to vegetables and fruit
\>The deathclaw seemed contented feasting on hunks of raw meat it had collected, eagerly tearing off massive chunks with its teeth and swallowing them whole
\>One evening, it even returned with a bottle of bourbon for each of you
\>In between its outings, you manage to converse with the creature a bit, though the fact that something so large and menacing can speak is still a bit of a surprise
\>You learn its name, though since it is an unintelligible growing sound that you can’t hope to replicate, you agree to refer to the deathclaw as Jackson
\>It seems Jackson has always been a bit more intelligent than the other deathclaws around him, which drove him to a more isolated lifestyle
\>He is fascinated by humans, but has had trouble with bandit groups in the past, hence his violent disposition towards them
\>He seemed to enjoy that you were a traveling caravan salesman, since it meant you were able to travel to all sorts of settlements and meet a wide range of people
\>Or ‘soft walkers’ as he called them
\>His biggest dream would be living amongst a group of them, though he knows “soft walkers scared of Jackson. We hurt soft walkers”
\>Still, he would mention that he was “lucky to meet you” during nearly every conversation
\>Finally, after you had regained much of your strength, Jackson felt confident to let you leave his cave
\>So long as he was there alongside you
\>During these outings, you would help him gather food, and watch as he hunted
\>When on the prowl, his predatory instincts seemed to kick in, and he would viciously tackle prey before tearing them to shreds with abandon
\>Yet, once the meat with settled into his stomach, he would trot back at you, a contented look on his face and tongue plopped outside his mouth
\>It was quite adorable, despite his monstrous visage

\>After spending several weeks living with Jackson, you explained that you needed to travel back to the nearest village and report back to your union that you were still alive
\>Jackson was quite distraught that you would be leaving, saying that “Jackson no want lose friend”
\>You comforted him, explaining that you wanted him to come with you (after all, there was no chance of a lone trader surviving the journey), and that you certainly would still consider him a close friend
\>He was incredibly pleased to hear this, giving you a tight hug as he happily licked your face with a tongue almost as long as your arm
\>You had to implore him to not squeeze hard enough to crack any ribs, but were still happy to see him so excited
\>The next day, the two of you set off, working your way south to follow the caravan trails to Grand View
\>Thankfully, with a hulking deathclaw as your companion, almost nothing was willing to mess with you
\>The occasional mutated insect or beast that did give you trouble was quickly dispatched by Jackson
\>By the third day, you two had managed to reach a cave system which reminded Jackson of home, and he urged you to spend the night there
\>He was resorting to his puppy-dog eyed look, and you just couldn’t say no to that
\>As you set up a fire to cook the food, Jackson went hunting, returning with a large radscorpion
\>Thankfully, this wasn’t your first time preparing giant arthropods, and Jackson was enthralled with your cooking skills, so much so that you had to actively convince him not to gather 5 more radscorpions that night
\>As the sun set, you bid one another a pleasant sleep
\>Unlike the other cave Jackson had lived in, this proved to have a much rougher floor, and sleeping on it comfortably was nearly impossible
\>You tossed and turned for several hours, before giving up, hoping a short walk around the cave would help tire you out
\>Raising your head to look around, you notice that Jackson was nowhere to be found
\>Seems he must be going to get those radscorpions after all
\>You stretch a bit before rising to your feet, and make your way to the mouth of the cave
\>As you near the entrance, you begin to hear what sounds like throated, ragged breathing
\>Almost as if someone was in the middle of an arduous workout
\>Though certainly louder and deeper than any human could have sounded
\>Looking to the left from the cave, you see Jackson hunched over facing away from you, seemingly focused on something
\>”Jackson” you ask “Is everything alright there?”
\>The deathclaw wheels around to face you, and you are awestruck by what you see
\>Between his legs is a massive cock, the shaft ridged and bumpy as it curves up towards Jackson’s face
\>At its base is a massive knot, flared out and twitching with the dick
\>The tip leaks a thick drip of green cum, with a bead having glazed down the shaft and onto the slit the entire penis seemed to emerge from
\>You couldn’t help but stare directly at it, just as dumbfounded as the first time you met Jackson
\>You assumed that if he had a cock, it would be big, but this was nearly the size of your forearm
\>Jackson simply stood there, panting as his cock continued to drip onto the floor
\>He said nothing, only walking up to you slowly
\>His size and stature giving off an almost menacing presence
\>Despite this, you couldn’t help but feel a twinge of excitement at the scene unfolding in from of you
\>Your pants became tight as you felt your own cock harden, and your mouth seemed to wet itself with anticipation
\>Finally, Jackson was standing right up against you, his cock almost pressed onto your face
\>You could feel the heat emanating from it, and could tell it was just as thick with muscle as the rest of the deathclaw
\>”Please…” he insisted “help…”
\>Without a word, you wrapped your hand around his shaft, your fingers only reaching roughly halfway around
\>Your hand moves up and down his length, feeling all the bumps push against your skin
\>With the amount of pre coating his cock, it makes for a nice lube, and your strokes have no trouble shifting up and down
\>As you stroke his twitching cock, your other hands finds itself begin to pump away at your own manhood, spurred on by just how hot this all is
\>Jackson lets out a long moan, and his column pulses from the sensation
\>”Touch…good…” he growls to you, his tongue beginning to snake its way out of his mouth
\>His heavy gasps push you to stroke him even faster, and you can’t help but groan yourself
\>You even extend your head towards his shaft, giving the length a short lick before kissing the tip
\>Your efforts are rewarded by a large glob of pre forming at the head of his cock, which you greedily lick up
\>Something about his seed seems so addicting to you, and you feel as though you could live off just this for the foreseeable future
\>During this, something in Jackson’s head seems to click, and he pushes himself forward, forcing you onto your back
\>Taking a more active role, he begind to thrust his hips, grinding his massive pillar against your cock, abs and chest
\>With the ferocity of his humping, the tip almost reaches your lips as well
\>You reach your mouth forward to kiss his cock as he thrusts away, and begin to grind your own hips against him
\>Joined together like this, your breathing seems to join to become one, and your eyes lock onto one another’s
\>To your sides you can feel Jackson’s claws digging into the dirt, stabilizing himself as he pumps away
\>The two of you continue this grinding for what feels like both and eternity, and just an instant
\>But soon, each of you realize the other is close
\>”Jackson…almost…” the beast struggles as he grits his teeth
\>You answer him only with a nod, and open your mouth to accept his seed
\>You two both cum in tandem, with his spunk blasting onto your face, completely drenching it and your throat in hot, sticky globs of green semen
\>The pulsing of his cumming cock drives you over the edge, and you make a mess of one another as you nut onto the bottom of his cock and your chest
\>Finally, after the two of you had been milked dry, Jackson pulled himself off you of, his engorged cock hanging over you, still twitching in the moonlight
\>You can barely move, the immense weight of his ejaculate almost weighing you down
\>Thankfully, Jackson offers you some respite, licking up much of his seed from your face and chest
\>Not wanting to be outdone, you swallow down his cum sitting in your mouth, and feel it work its way into your stomach
\>You’re surprised you’re not visibly swollen with how much you had choked down
\>”So…feeling better?” you jokingly ask him as you struggle to your feet, legs a bit shaky after the events that had transpired
\>A throaty gurgle sound emanates from deep inside Jackson’s throat, which you’ve learned from your time with him is how deathclaws laugh
\>“Yes…Jackson feel good…”
\>“Love…soft walker…”
\>You feel your heart flutter at his words, and you struggle over to him, wrapping your arms around his waist
\>The two of you stay like that for a long while, both bathed in the cool night’s breeze, and the light of the starts peering down on the happy couple


\>It takes you a few more days to reach Grand View
\>During the trip, you learn that the reason for Jackson’s behavior that night is it is his breeding season, and he is currently in heat
\>He was hoping to stroke himself off outside to avoid bothering you in your sleep, but seeing you standing there drove him to give in to his animalistic needs
\>Of course, the breeding season of deathclaws lasts several weeks, and so he needed to be emptied of seed several times a day
\>Something you were more than happy to help with
\>As you reach Grand View, the once cheery and friendly disposition that Jackson carried with him during the trip shifts to a more morose one
\>It’s clear that he is sad the trip is over, and his new friend seems to be leaving him
\>”Jackson…will miss soft walker” he tells you as you overlook the town from a bluff
\>”What are you talking about?” you ask him “I’m not leaving you. I’ve still got a lot of trips to make, people to meet. And I wouldn’t want you to miss any of that”
\>Upon hearing those words, Jackson’s sad demeanor completely vanishes, and his joyful and friendly mood comes back in an instant as he gives you yet another overly tight hug
\>Thankfully, you’ve gotten quite used to those now
\>”Before visit town…” Jackson begins, as he lets you go from his clutch to catch your breath “Jackson need…more help…”
\>You can’t help but chuckle a bit, as you begin to unbuckle your pants
\>This was certainly going to be quite the relationship
