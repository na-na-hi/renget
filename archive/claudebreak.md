#Claude Filter Got You Down?

I'm sharing the wisdom of smarter anons here. This a combination of two separate instances. May be the same person, may not be.; in their words, here's what this is: 

>Claude is a text completion model, not a chat completion model. Which means you can send it prompts that are half way through a message and have Claude complete it, unlike chat completion models like turbo and GPT-4 which forcefully appends <|im_start|> and user/Assistant/system to prompts.

>This is called prefilling responses, which would be a lot more stronger filter bypass if there was an option to not auto append an "\n\nAssitant:" prompt in Silly.*

>Anthropic even used to show off this [ability](https://web.archive.org/web/20230306084513/https://console.anthropic.com/docs/prompt-design/being-explicit#prefill-the-response) but they removed it from the new docs.

Also note that one of those anons had this to say:

!!!danger Doing some other tests on Claude v1.3 API, not that there was any doubt but now I can confidently say that Slack injects extra filtering prompts and most likely has something that triggers an external filter.

~~But I have heard reports that as of 6/29/23, the slack been removed, so your mileage may vary.~~  

**Nevermind, it's reported that the filter is back and Slaude is retarded again as of 6/29/23. Slaude likely switched to instant.**

!!!Danger Fuck you, I don't want to read!

Copy and paste this at the ***END*** of your jailbreak.
