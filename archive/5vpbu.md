->Chapter 4: The Dark side of the Moon<-

A couple days have past and in that time Anon had been slowly counting off the days in his head which felt like an eternity. The 9th couldn't come any faster Anon thought. He had also gotten a message from Nancie a few days ago about registering himself as a werewolf at city hall, and to reserve the gymnasium for the next full moon. Anon wasn't sure if he wanted his first transformation to be surveyed, but it seemed to bother Rory for some reason, but he wouldn't say why.

Besides Anon nearly shooting Rory thinking he was a burglar after he heard a loud crash last night which just turned out to be the couch, which broke under Rory's weight; but now they were running low on food. Anon thought to go to the store since he had nothing to do, but before he could leave Rory wanted to come along. Anon had hoped he would be fine on his own, but he probably should get out of the house at least. As a precaution, Anon gave Rory one of his hats to hide his face, though the wild hair on his arms would give him away, but unfortunately Anon doesn't have anything in Rory's size at all. Though the idea of Rory trying on tight shirts and tearing them as he flexed his huge muscles, was very hot.

After a long shopping spree at the store, Anon wanted to buy Rory a shirt to hide his arms but then he said
"I've got some long sleeves at home. We could go there."
"Uh.. we can't" Anon said guiltily "I kinda told my team you'd probably be there, so it's under surveillance. Sorry!"

Since that was a no go they both headed to a clothing store. After a few mishaps with tearing some clothes by accident, Anon picking out some stuff and for a brief moment at the register, their hands grazed each other, making their hearts jump. And if Anon was honest with himself, he really was enjoying Rory's company the past few days. If I had a tail, it'd definitely be wagging the whole time. Anon thought to himself. And of course, Rory was always happy to be with Anon.

A whole week has passed and Anon was wondering when his wolf features would start showing. Rory said it should start on the first day of the week of the full moon, and since the full moon was on the 9th of next month, then it would be on the 2nd. Anon might not look it, but he definitely felt like he was changing. When he was trying to see the damage on the couch, he could very easily lift it, like cardboard he thought. His sense of smell was also improving to the point where he could smell spoiled food without checking and could swear some of his clothes felt strange, like they're smaller? With all of these changes the full moon couldn't come any faster.

As the end of week two rolled over, Anon was seriously contemplating on whether to reserve the gymnasium. At the very least he should register his new status at city hall. He knows it's not required by law and they cannot force you either way, but it kept gnawing at the back of his head, so he decided there and told Rory who was playing Skyrim on the TV.
"Rory.. I'm gonna go to city hall and register, and to reserve the gymnasium too." as soon as Anon said that Rory quickly jerked his head and looked at him in shock.
"W-what? Wait no!" Rory exclaimed startling Anon "You- you shouldn't!"
"Why not? You've been pretty reserved about this, but why?"
"I mean.. you can register. But you shouldn't reserve it, cuz"
"Cuz...?" Anon knew how talking about the gymnasium made Rory squeamish but he still wouldn't say why after all this time. There was an awkward silence until Rory spoke.
"Well cuz.. I was hoping to be there.. with you.. on your first full moon." Rory said looking like someone who's asking for a date, then he got up "We're pack mates now, and it should be my responsibility to show you how to control yourself. To be a good wolf. And that I want you to be safe." he said with an air of duty. Anon couldn't believe Rory taking charge like this, but more so how touched Anon felt.
"You.. want to be there with me?" Anon asked and Rory nodded "And you'll stay? The whole time?" Anon asked, his heart on the precipice.
"The whole time, I swear" he said reaching out an open palm. 

Anon really couldn't believe this was happening and not wanting to waste this precious moment, he placed his own on top Rory's huge hand. As soon as Anon felt Rory's skin it was very warm and soft. Rory slowly closed his hand like he was holding something delicate and precious. The warmth of his hands and his ferocious claws made Anon feel safe and protected. Rory wanted nothing more than for Anon to feel important and cared for. For a while this blessed quietness could silence the entire world, until Anon said.
"I should get to city hall. Do you wanna come?" Anon asked cheekily.
"Yes!" Rory said and they both headed out still holding hands.

Registering at city hall couldn't be more breezy, and with Rory perfectly disguised who was beside Anon the entire time, he felt as nothing could go wrong. All Anon needed were his identification papers and when it got to proving Anon was a werewolf, he didn't need to give a blood sample or anything. The lady they were working with said Anon's 'eyes' was all she needed. My eyes? Anon thought.
"Your eyes are the same as all the other werewolves." she said as she continued to type some stuff down until Rory looked and saw.
"Hey she's right! Look!" Rory said excitedly as he took out his phone, put it on camera mode and held it to Anon. And it was true, Anon's eyes had changed to a deep yellow, a trait shared by all werewolves.
"Woah." Anon said wondrously. Besides every other change in him, the color of his eyes really confirm Anon is a werewolf. It got his heart racing and Rory couldn't be happier.

They both left city hall holding each other's hand and deciding to stay at a park nearby and stayed until nighttime. Anon was staring at the moon which was in it's first quarter phase. Just two more weeks he thought to himself. Rory noticed the excitement in Anon's face and felt like impressing him.
"There's a lot of stars out tonight." Rory said looking up. Anon didn't realize until Rory said it, but there really were a ton of stars tonight. It's all so pretty. "See there? The big dipper?" Rory said pointing and then he slowly moved his finger down "If you go down from the 'handle' you reach Arcturus in Bootes, " Rory went down to an orange star which was Arcturus, "And then if you go down again you can find Spica in the constellation Virgo!" and then a bright blue star which was Spica. Anon didn't know much about the night sky other than Polaris and the Big Dipper.
"You know about constellations? Anon asked hoping to hear more "Or is that something werewolves should know too?" this made Rory laugh.
"Not really, but yeah. I was really into stargazing as a kid." Anon could see Rory reminiscing on his face, he really was handsome in the moonlight. "I'd stay in the backyard with my dad and we'd stay and watch for a long time. Yeah" Rory suddenly seemed down, Anon thought this might have to do with his father?
"Your dad sounds nice." Anon said softly
"Yeah, he is" Rory was speaking very heavily now "Do... could we stay here, for a little longer?" Anon could tell Rory was real upset about something. Anon reached for Rory's hand on the bench and squeezed gently.
"Of course"

***

The first day of the cycle started and Anon woke up scratching his head when he felt a very sharp pain. Looking at his hands there was some blood and more to his surprise his nails, were long and sharp. Anon blasted off to the bathroom to see what else had changed. He stared into the mirror and saw stubble all over his face, his hair seemed a little longer and wild, his ears were pointy, and there was a lot of hair on the back of his palms and forearms; he opened his mouth and frankly enough his canines were much bigger. Finally, Anon thought while feeling his own fangs. Anon stepped back to see himself in the mirror, Anon really couldn't believe how wild he looked, it was enough to make him feel powerful and hot. Since it was pretty early and Rory was still asleep, Anon thought to squeeze in a quick fap over his new body.

Later that day after Rory saw 'wolfy' Anon and going ecstatic they both decided to go to the park that was nearby Anon's house. Although it was past nine in the afternoon they sat behind a row of trees and bushes, just to be safe. Rory was relaxing and checking his phone while Anon was looking forward to the full moon until he suddenly had some serious thoughts, about Rory. 'I really like being with Rory but.. why am I.. Rory is still.' Anon knew that Rory was still a wanted criminal and there was no mystery, he really did kill those three men as a wolf. It was all captured on camera. Anon still remembered watching it, Rory attacked more viciously than any animal, all while transforming and throwing those men around like meaty ragdolls. He practically tore them apart. It was hard to watch.

Looking back it doesn't seem Rory attacked those men out of pure savageness. There was more to it. Rory isn't a monster. He's too fucking sweet and actually caring to be a psycho. He may not be on the job but he definitely has the culprit next to him and Anon knows full well that this, 'them', can't go on like this. Especially if they're going to more than whatever they are now. Anon needed the truth and before he could say anything, Rory began.

"Anon" he said heavily, putting away his phone "I... I've been wondering how much longer we can be like this. I really want to wait for the full moon, but.. I can't help but feel like I'm just delaying the inevitable." Rory said with a painful expression. Anon felt exactly as Rory did. He continued "Can.. can you tell me what's gonna happen.. to me?" Anon wished Rory didn't ask something like that, in that moment in Anon's mind, he knew what would happen to him if he was caught, for laws pertaining werewolves were much harsher.

"W-well you're charged with three accounts of homicide and- fuck!" Anon just realized homicide isn't the only crime Rory had committed "You would also be charged with, 'Forced Lycanthropy'. Because of me." things just got a lot bleaker for Rory and Anon felt like shit since it was his idea. 

'Forced Lycanthropy' is a situation where another person has been 'infected' by another werewolf through some way of force like blackmail, threats, or assault. Whether or not the victim wanted to be a werewolf in the first place is completely irrelevant, and the charged werewolf is usually given a few months of jailtime and to also pay any and all charges to the victim for their new status.

"With those together.. you could be looking at, fifteen to tw-twenty years in jail." Anon said, he felt his heart sink again. Both Rory and Anon felt like they were in a deep, inescapable pit. Like a grave they dug themselves. No matter how long they wait nothing can change what Rory has done. They both sat as the weight of reality crushes them, until Rory finally made a decision.

"**Fuck**." Rory said aloud "Ok... you wanna know what happened? I'll tell you everything. All of it." Anon gripped Rory's hand and he gripped back. This was it.

"I was having a really shitty day. My car broke down before I could get to work, so I had to walk." If Anon remembered, Rory worked at a warehouse on the other side of town. Rory continues "Work wasn't any better. I had a thirteen hour shift and it was busy as hell all day; and while I was in the middle of work, I got a phone call.. from a hospital back in my hometown. They told me my dad was assaulted and was in a coma. The police say he was attacked last night and his neighbor found him unconscious on the front yard that morning. I didn't know what to do! I was in the middle of work and I had a shitty manager who would probably report me if I left and even if I could leave, there was no way I could see him! So I just worked all day and I was so exhausted, even for me. And then I walked home, until I decided to go to a pub. Soon after, these three men came in and I could tell they were drunk, I could smell the beer off them and they were loud and obnoxious. They were bothering everyone else in the pub and then they decided to bother me.

'Oi! look at the size of that fucker!'

They wouldn't stop bugging me so when I turned around, that's when I recognized that they were my dad's old friends, and they also recognized me.

'Well well, if it ain't Rory! Daddy's lil wolf'
'Fuck off Dennis, all of you. Leave me the fuck alone!' I tried baring my fangs to scare them, but it just made them more annoying.
'Woah, is that any way to speak to your daddy's old friends?'
'My Dad stopped talking to you guys a long time ago and for good reason. You're nothing but a bunch of idiot drunks.' That's what my Dad would call them. But it just made Dennis angry and that's when he went off.
'Oh yeah I remember. Back when that bitch wife died, he fucking stopped letting us hang out with him. Said he "Has a child now and can't have us around the baby!"
'And he was right. About everything.' I got up and was about to head out, but then I smelled something. It was coming from them. Under all that beer and alcohol, I could smell my Dad, his scent. On all of them. Then I came up to their table.
'Why the fuck can I smell my Dad off you?' then they all just laughed.
'Didja hear that? He can "smell" his dad. Some people thinkin' they're really dogs n' shiet-'
*BANG*
'Fuckin' tell me why you have my Dad's scent!' then the other one said
'W-well we went to go see him.' the bald one said and then Dennis says
"Yeah, we thought like, fuck it, and that maybe we could be friends again and we'd drink like old times. But he just when on a tangent about his "heart", and then he fuckin said he would call the cops on us if we didn't leave. The little shit.' I remembered his face as he drank like he didn't give a shit, and that's when he said it. 'Y'know, I had enough of his high moral bullshit; and I threw my bottle at his too-goody face. That fucker could take a bottle to the face, but not all of us-' that's when I grabbed him and held him up. I remember everyone else in the pub getting scared and the owner yelling at me, but I wasn't listening, I was too fucking angry.
'Give.. me.. one.. **fucking** reason.. why I shouldn't just turn you drunken little shits in. I swear.' I remember how he was shaking, but he still acted like tough shit and smiled.
'Your Daddy always went on about you, his precious "star child", you were all he fucking talked about. He would be lucky to die in that hospital and he'd be glad to leave you-'

That's when I lost it. I've never been so angry in my life, I-I honestly thought I was gonna go savage and hurt everyone else there! But after they were.. dead, I ran out and I've been on the run since." After all that, Anon had a lot emotions brewing inside. Grief for Rory. Hatred for those men, and a bit of panic.

"I'm so sorry Rory." Anon couldn't help but feel horrible for him and squeezed his hand as gently as he could. "How is he? Your Dad?"
"He's fine." Rory gave a light smile. He was glad Anon cared. "He recovered a long time ago. Y'know, while I was on the run I called the same hospital, a week after. They said he was fine now and left the, but they say he can't remember who attacked him." Anon felt even more horrible that Rory had to call about his father while on the run. Rory then turned to look at Anon. He was especially handsome in the moonlight and then he spoke.
 
"Anon.. I really fucking like you and I.. want us to be together, and stuff." Anon's heart was fluttering madly, but he had a bad feeling. "I don't want this to drag us down. I can't let that happen." Rory held their mingled claws up and he had a warm smile. "That's why, I'm gonna turn myself in."

Anon felt oblivion swallow him whole. Turn himself in?! No. No! This can't be happening!

"No wait!" Anon exclaimed "You can't! I know what I said about your sentence, but that was just a guess! I-It could even be worse, I honestly don't know what'll happen to you! You! You-" Anon suddenly had and idea, something that can keep Rory safe. Something that'll keep them together, in a way. "Rory... you have to leave here!"

"What?! No! That won't solve anything!"
"Rory I can assure you, you won't get a fair trial. I know this won't really improve anything! But gods please don't do this! Not like this!"
"But I promised I'd stay till your first full moon! I want to show you! I need to show you! Just let me do this for you!!!" Rory howled so loudly Anon could hear his shout echo a very long distance, until he heard something else. Then they both heard it. Sirens. Police sirens.

Anon panicked and they both hoofed it. Anon ran as fast as he could and he was running faster than he ever had in his life. Must have been that werewolf strength in his legs, he almost ran on all fours if it would make him go faster. Anon and Rory bolted around cars, corners, signs, everything, and when Anon saw his fence just a few yards away he suddenly jumped and landed on the lawn. Anon almost felt like he was a wolf already.

As Rory came beside Anon they both hurried inside; even though the sirens were quiet and far, there's no telling whether they're still in pursuit. Anon shut the door, turned and saw Rory's glowing yellow eyes in the dark. Anon stepped slowly towards Rory and grabbed both of his thick, strong forearms and looked him in the eyes.
"Rory. I want you to be safe and I'd hate for us to be separated but.. this is the only way. Please?" Anon begged softly and laid his head on Rory's giant chest. "I.. can't lose you!" Rory felt each of those words hit him like stones. If this is the only way to make Anon feel safe. Then it shall be.
"Ok. I'll go. For us."

Anon packed everything Rory could need. Clothes to hide himself. Money for food and transport, and some blankets in case he needed to sleep outside. As soon as Rory was before the door, Anon wanted one last thing from Rory. Being together this long hopefully wouldn't make asking for it awkward at all.

"Rory." Rory stopped and turned "Could I feel your fangs?" Anon asked hoping that wasn't too weird to request.
"Alright. Just be careful." Rory said, Anon nodded and stepped closer.

Rory leaned down a little for Anon to reach and slowly opened his mouth. As always, Rory's fangs were a sight of pure beasthood. Anon reached up and stroked the left fang and then both of them. They were really thick, and powerful and they were also warm. Anon tried to be careful with his claws around Rory's gums as he gripped his fangs between his thumb and index fingers. Holy fuck, Anon thought as he gulped down. If only he would give me playful bites. After he had his fill, Rory closed his his mouth and Anon stroked his face, and let go. It was time.

Rory was out the back door and Anon followed him to the backyard. Rory halted and was staring at the moon.
"Try and stay in the woods, as far you can and you should be fine. Promise me?" Rory said looking back and Anon nodded. It's the least I can do, Anon thought. Then Rory suddenly jumped high into another backyard, and then the next, and the next, and the next... until Anon couldn't see him anymore.

Anon turned back towards his house, through the back door, the kitchen, and onto his bed. Nothing but silence. Never to be filled with Rory again. Anon tried to stay calm, but he felt like he could break and shatter any moment now.

......
......
......
......
......

"**Fuck!**" Anon put his face in his palms and waited. Waiting for nothing.
