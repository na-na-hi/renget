## Berry Interlude: Cloudburst's conditioning

"M-My Lady..." Cloudburst the one and only and hopefully soon-to-be-out-of-the-job maid of the Goldengrape Vineyard stutters. It was rare for her to enter the lower levers of the Vineyard main building where the more personal winemaking is taking place. Especially this particular one. Mr. Colton was very insistent that his daughter knew how to take care of the equipment.

Which suited the curly, Blue-haired woman just fine. Frankly, since day one, she has been scared of the girl. Besides the fact girls her age are not meant to be so tall and... developed, there were those murderous looks she had the habit of throwing her way. And then, there were the things she has 'persuaded' her to do.

Cloudburst winces, as if Berry had a way to look into her mind. Stars above it sometimes felt that way.

"It's ok. It's ok. Just one more night. And I'll be free." She mutters to herself. Quietly, so the Wineyard devil couldn't hear her. Steeling her nerves she passes the threshold and carries the serving plate with a quick meal, down the staircase. Into the dark. The rock walls seem to swallow the dim light but enhance even the slightest sound that came from the depths. The vineyard has a very old aesthetic to it, not unlike old farms of the eastern countries. She remembers clearly as day that she used to find the place charming. Now she expected to find a BDSM collection, live-plucked out from some Ultra Hardcore 18+ movie.

She admits she might have some fantasies like that, but those were just fantasies. She didn't really mean those. She doesn't enjoy those things, no matter what her Mistress says. 

She almost drops the meal. Her face goes pale. She feverently shakes her head, dispeling the thoughts. Berry had an unsettling hold on her, but luckily it will be over soon. Stars, she was so close to leaving without looking at the Devil one last time.

Unfortunately, Mr. Colton asked her one last request, and she couldn't refuse. So she had to bite the proverbial bullet and obey his orders. One does not simply refuse such a nice and handsome man after all. 

Ahh! Bad thoughts! Bad thoughts! She has no strong feeling for the Master, one way or another. Think of something else. Like the- the- the Vineyard help! Yeah, they asked her if she could ask the young girl to meet them for... 'work discussion'. Yeah, right, she wasn't born yesterday. That's why she wanted to leave among other things. So much secrecy. So much debauchery in someone so young. Cloudburst understands that a growing person has needs, but by clouds stars, the girl's insatiable! One time she had accidentally stumbled upon her, on her knees surroanded by six large guys. She could barely recognize her with all that white on her face. The kicker? Her reaction. An order to close the door and prepare her a bath.

She has a lot of time to think before her feet touch the thick wooden balks that make the floor and perhaps she didn't notice anything sooner. Once she's at the bottom, she gags when a putrid smell of fermenting grapes hits her nose. Just like the building the basement walls are made out of regally carved marble stone. There're few small windows at the ground level, now open to ventilate the excess of Hydrogen Sulfide, as they call it. Atmospheric lights cast a warm hue over the bookcase filled with spices, ingredients, and bottles both empty and full. A wooden bucket big enough to take a bath in sits under the windows. But the most important of all - a truly demonic figure of perfectly proportioned Succubus in the middle of it all, sitting at the desk.

Redness spreads from Cloudburst's cheeks reaching her shoulders. It wouldn't be the first time she has seen Boysenberry naked, but every time feels like the first.

"What is it, Cloud?" Berry asks not gracing her servant with a gaze. No, she continues swirling the substance in a bowl with a spoon before pouring it into an ornate wineglass. She let it breathe for a sec, then she takes a whiff. Her mind bogs, and her ass clenches. Ufff, strong brew, she thinks wiping tears from the corners of her eyes. Maybe too strong? Perhaps it would be better to test it before she takes it back to her new scout companions. It would be bad for business if someone got poisoned.

She turns around, finding the perfect test subject.

"What's the occasion? You never visit my Mixing Room." She stands up, presenting herself to the servant. Her nipples are hard, and her pussy is wet, but her face expresses nothing but suspicion. "A meal? For me?"

"Y-your father, m-mam." The maid sweats bullets, despite feeling the cold breath of the Reaper on her back. The soup on the plate ripples, and only her superior sense of balance keeps it alive. "He-he asked me-t-to-"

"Cloudburst." Berry cuts her off, her pupils narrowing. "Didn't I train you to not speak with my father?"

"I didn't start it! I didn't say anything!" She would gulp if she could. She feels icy fingers around her heart. "I only nodded. No words were exchanged."

Berry flares her nostrils. "Ohh, Cloud, so disappointing." The Wine Devil walks towards her, her large tits bouncing hypnotically with every step. The wine swirls in her glass and she intentionally allows some of it to spill and splash onto her flawless tits. Cloud notices the flesh around her nubs of her nipples to grow and darken." You were such an obedient servant, but now? Tsk. I should paddle your ass until it's red like my family wine." Cloudburst is silent, her face is one of panic, and her knees shake. She's ready to throw the plate and run. Run and never stop." But since this is your last night, I'll forgive you." This time the maid gulps. Really? She tries to see any sign of deception, but nothing, Miss Boysenberry looks... friendly? An easy smile on her lips is not unlike her father's. "Actually, why don't we celebrate? Would you care for a drink?" In a quick step, she closes the distance between them, much to the maid horror.

"I-I don't think I should, ma'am." The Blue-haired maid stutters, alarms going off in her brain. "I'm still on work and -"

"Put the plate down." Berry gives an order. The metal plate touching the ground only a second later is a proof of how effective Boysenberry's conditiong is. "Good. Now, take a sip." The young Tyrant puts the wine closer to the older woman's face. The crimson liquid is dark almost as dark as Berry's hair.

Cloudburst tries to keep her defiance, but the smell enters her nose and pierces her brain. Her vision blurs until all she can see are the cesire eyes gleaming in the dim light. Her mid bogs, disrupting the charges between synapses.

Berry hums in interest. It didn't affect her that much, but Cloudburst looks like someone has hit her with a frying pan. Her curiosity picked, Berry presses the cool glass to the maid's lips. She doesn't fight her, which surprises the young winemaker. She expected at least a flinch, but besides a series of deliciously lustful moans, the slave woman barely reacts and drinks her special brew greedily. A dark rivulet forms on her chin, before dropping on her uniform. The more the woman drinks the more her uniform dissolves. Once it's finished Cloudburst's shoulderless top is sold in place only by her impressive cleavage.

Were they always that big? Berry ponders. She remembers this slut showing up in her breasts and ass in a size too small blue dress. She clearly had hots for him, what woman wouldn't. But she isn't so sure, now. Nevermind. Questions for later.

"Cloudburst." Berry speaks up, yanking her attention back to her. "Lift your skirt." The maid obediently do as she's told. Leaning way forward, she grabs the frilly hem of her white apron and lifts it up. The black petticoat looks fairly normal from the sides and back but it's front is cut off, allowing an easy access to her luscious legs soaked with honey. The moisture leaks from pussy lips holding a vibration egg . A thin wire connected the toy to the remote, hold by a frilly black and white garter.

Unceremoniously, Berry rips it off. 

"Aghh!!" The newly born bimbo gasps, pressing her hands to her crotch. "Mistress, please! I-I-"

"Shut up." Berry orders looking at her creations. Not bad, not bad at all. Maybe tone it down, just a tiniest bit -nahh. Perfect in first try, she concludes, putting an arm under her bust. "Congratulations, Cloudy. You've made me very happy. And people that make me happy deserve a reward."

"Does that mean...?" Cloud gives a slow, hopeful, somewhat crazy smile.

"That's right. You can go to the Workers sleeping quarters." Her smile matches Cloudburst. "Have fun. As much as you desire."

"THANK YOU!!!" The accidental bimbo shrills and drops to her knees. And then, much to Berry's shock and disgust starts to kiss Berry's toes. Thank you! "Kiss." Thank you! "Kiss."

Okay, maybe tone it down a bit. It's no fun to break people that are already broken.
