(Cool, we can use them interchangeably if you want, Artemisia is a genus of plant that contains Wormwood, which was my second name idea but thought it was to icky given you might be bimboing her at some point? Also, as It hasn't been discussed yet.

------------
You are a Changeling. Quite a powerful one, which is why you are being pursued by several "interested" parties. But they haven't caught you yet and you still have a bit of time....

Lively. 

That probably would have been the best way to describe the large room you now find yourself in. You've managed to bluff your way into an induction week as a potential new student. By coincidence, there are a number of other students also there from varying schools around Canterlot.

Too many for any one student to lead the tour. Instead, people are being split into one and twos and being lead around by several full time students or staff of Canterlot High.

Could any of these people be the agents sent after you? The Equestrian was supposedly delayed yet Chrysalis's agent could be anywhere...

You don't let your nerves show. Even though you're not an infiltrator by profession, you are still a changeling and one brave enough to defy the Queen as well. You will not show terror.

You're distracted slightly by a strange tang in the air. It's magic. Which isn't wholly unusual given what your intelligence said about this place. It's had more than enough reason to be magically charged and you felt it as soon as you stepped through the mirror...

But there is something else as well...A soft, cloying sweetness that fuzzes your head slightly. A different type of magic? Not changeling or pony but something electric...

You snap back to reality as you realise you are next in line. By good fortune you realise you are perfectly poised to choose your tour guide. Your extensive spying has given you a pretty good idea of whose who.

Who do you choose?

A) The Flower Trio - You'll be outnumbered but by all accounts, they don't have much in the way of resistances. Maybe the best place to start is small?
B) Pinkie Pie - The pink girl is practically *vibrating.* She could be dangerous. She's said to be incredibly unpredictable and on top of that, you can feel the harmonic magic protecting her. She'll be risky, but you could have an in with the elements if all goes well?
C) Ms Harshwhinny - The dour looking older woman looks disgusted that she's been put upon to play tourguide. She's not got any magical protection but sheer bullheaded sourness might make up for that! Still, you would have a foothold in the faculty and then you're only a few steps from the Principals...
D) Flash Sentry -  The handsome young man is smiling genially and having a warm conversation with a attractive young woman in a leather vest that you recognise as Sunset Shimmer. The leader of the elements in this world. She doesn't appear to be participating in the tours yet Flash Sentry could be another avenue to pursue to strike at Sunset.
E) Other?

The Frumpy looking woman scowls as you approach. It's a pretty good scowl actually. You're not sure if even Chrysalis could do better with the woman's look of sheer put-upon weariness and general contempt for all and sundry.

Still, with nothing more than a sniff to let you know her feelings and double clock of her pen,

'Name?' She says tersely and you respond quickly, the stern woman reminding you of your lecturers in the Hive's Arcane University,

'Gossamer Wing, Ma'am' 

She quirks an eyebrow at the "Ma'am" before looking down and scribbling some details down on her clipboard.

You take some time to study her. She's not "unattractive" per se, in fact if she tidied up and stopped scowling she would probably be a very well matured older woman. Her long tan cardigan obscures most of her upper half and the beige slacks aren't helping either but despite some plumpness caused by age and lines on her face caused by stress...

Yeah...You could work with this...

'Come on then.' She says, beckoning you with her clipboard.

You follow, your short, slender body having trouble keeping up with the woman's long, purposeful stride. You wish you could change yourself but your shifting magic only seems to work on and off  and you'd rather not suddenly grow two foot and three cupsizes mid conversation...

Still, as short and skinny as you are, from what you can tell, your soft, aqua skin doesn't seem riddled with pimples and by all the standards of the school you seem "cute but unassuming..."

You also get a view of Ms Harshwhinny ass that is neither "cute or unassuming." It's large, plump even with very little in the way of sag. In fact, it'd look pretty appealing in anything other than brown slacks and the stiff gaited walk of Ms Harshwhinny.

'You'll be expected to join a club. Several have been formed by..."enterprising"...students to help you get a feel for what Canterlot High is all about.' She says the words in the deadpan tone of voice of a woman reading off a script. Apart from the words "enterprising" which she says like she's verbally scraping it off of her shoe.

She hands you a scrap of paper with several clubs on them and their Coordinators, Many of them have already been stamped as filled

-Applied Sciences - MoonDancer and (Sci)Twilight Sparkle. It occurs to you that you may be able to learn more about your powers and how the effect the world here. Your reports mention that the two coordinators were dabbling in it.

-Botany - Lead by Treehugger and Daisy. It mentions that Daisy will be unavailable for the first day due to tour duties. You were never an alchemist. Your inborn talent never forcing you to stoop to the levels of those dabbling amateurs but there may be something to it in this world?

-Cooking - Lead by Pinkie Pie. (Somehow doubling up as a tourguide and a coordinator).

-Sports - Lead by Rainbow Dash and Lightning Dust. This one is probably the least appealing to you. You were never the most physical of changelings to begin with, somthing the Drill'Lings took great pleasure in reminding you of when you were trained  for special operations yet as Ms Harshwhinny guides you past the sports field you feel a *thrumb* of that cloying, overpowering magic coming from the sports shed. It's a fast pulse and it almost bowls you over as a dull but insistent warmth appears between your legs.

Ms Harshwhinny seems to feel it as well, even though she doesn't have your knack for sensing magic. Her breath catches in her throat and a small flush rises to her cheeks, a lock of her tightly wound bun springs free and falls over her face.

It's over in an instant but you *certainly* felt it. You'd need access to the SportsShed to get a better look at whatever the hell that was though...

It also occurs to you, alone with Ms Harshwhinny in the shadow of the gym, that you could work some magic here if you were inclined...

The pulse leaves you monetarily dazed but not stunned enough to feel a slight tickle of the strange foreign magic try to creep into your body. It doesn't feel malicious, it barely feels sentient. Merely a collection of sensations and ideas wrapped in a hazy pink cloud of bubblyness and arousal.

You fight it off, swatting it away on impulse and bringing your magical defences up but it flees before anything more can come of it. It seems...flighty? It wasn't so much an attack, not even a probe just a quick slap on the ass...

Odd...

You feel there is a power there. A deep reservoir of magic that you could maybe use? A power you could maybe use? But what's the stop it using you?

Your thoughts are interrupted by a soft sigh for Ms Harshwhinny. She shivers slightly, eyes glowing a soft pink as a series of subtle changes wash over her. A few of the lines on her face fade, her hair regaining some of it's lustre as it grows a few inches, filling with volume. Several more locks burst free of the tight bun before it cinches tighter, enveloping them once more in an even larger, somehow even more severe bun. That appears to be the end of it. It doesn't *seem* like much and yet...was her blouse and cardigan tighter?

It was hard to tell.

'Ahem-' Harshwhinny says, shaking her head and collecting herself. The pink fading from her eyes, replaced with the same stern stare...

Or was it perhaps softer?

She clicks her pen once more, snatching the paper from you and quirking a slender eyebrow,

She's far to professional to say anything but she's clearly chewing on somthing-

'Are...' She begins hesitantly, her voice for the first time betraying a hint of tenderness, 'I must warn you Ms Wing, Ms Dash and Ms Dust are somewhat...keen, when it comes to sport.'

She's seen your skinny nerdy body and she's worried that you're gonna be broken by the two sports buffs.

You're not to hot on the idea yourself but somthing happened in that shed and you're gonna get to the bottom of it.

Harshwhinny sees your assent and clears her throat brusqly before turning and tromping back across the field,

'This way then-Come on, Chop Chop!'

----------

You sight the motley clump that makes up the sport's club, hanging out at the top of the field. 

There...doesn't seem to be much sport going on...

Instead, two young women are sprinting as fast as they can away from the goal posts on the opposite side of the field towards the group.

As they grow closer, you easily clock the short rainbow haired woman as Rainbow Dash, while the similarly built woman with the shock of lightning golden hair you guess is Lightning Dust. They appear to be at a head, neck and neck before you see a gloating smirk come over Rainbow's face as she surges with a burst of astounding speed in the last stretch.

She easily outstrips Lightning who curses loudly as Rainbow crosses by the soccer posts marking the finishing line. A couple of the sports inductees applaud and clap, a few slapping Rainbow on the back while Lightning looks venomous. Most, having watched Lightning and Rainbow just race each other for the past twenty minutes look either sheepish or bored

Rainbow looks triumphant.

Both faces pale as-

'Ms Dust, Ms Dash!' Ms Harshwhinny says, striding forward and bearing down on the two of them,

'Hey Ms Harshwhinny, You're looking good-'

'What did I say when I brought the last group? You are here to run the attendees through Canterlot High's Prestigious sports facilities-'

The tirade goes on for a while and only ends with Ms Harshwhinny storming away, promising to be back promptly with more recruits and swearing blind that there better be some "team games or somthing of that kind!' when she gets back.

Rainbow looks suitably chided, her blue cheeks blushing while Lightning just looks mutinous. They soon get the gaggle of students into groups and paired up doing various sporty things.

Rainbow coughs awkwardly and walks over to you, holding out her hand. You take it, her grip is firm and she gives you a teasing squeeze before slapping you on the shoulder.

'How ya doing? I'm Rainbow and that's Lightning-' She jerks her head over to the mulish looking Lightning Dust, '-Uh, Sorry you had to see that-Me and Lightning get a little Competitive. I don't know why, I beat her every time-' She says teasingly, softly rocking into Lightning and shouldering her playfully.

Lightning shoves her back, perhaps a bit harder than is warranted but Rainbow takes it in stride.
'Not every time, Remember when-'

'That doesn't count.' Rainbow says briskly,

'Or-' 

'Neither does that time!'

You get the impression this is pretty standard faire for them and yet-

Lightning...

There's somthing off about Lightning. It's barely perceptible but...

You lock up slightly as you sense an innate magic in her, is it StarveHeart?
Or Artemisia or whatever the hell she's calling herself now.

Has she found you already? There was nothing in Lightning Dust's files about magic-

Wait...No...That's not it...

Theirs's just a wisp of pink around her aura...

Dormant or hiding...

Hmm...

'Funny how whenever I win it doesn't count-' Lightning says, her smile showing a lot of gritted teeth and Rainbow gives another cheeky grin,

'Weeelll...We could always go again if you want?'

Lightning blinks, frowning, 'But Ms Harshwhinny said-'

'Aw come on, She won't be back for like, another five, ten minutes? Not even you're that slow Lightning-'

Lightning grits her teeth and says nothing, only nods, accepting the challenge before her face smooths suddenly, a grin crossing her face-

The Pink Aura around her swells, bubbling up as if excited.

'Sure, you're on Dash. First though, I think we're gonna need more balls-'

'That's what she said-'

'-for the club, Dash. For the club-' She rolls her eyes before plastering a grin on her face again, 'You mind grabbing them? I've just go to...stretch off real quick.'

You smell bullshit but Rainbow shrugs and heads off towards the sports shed.

The shed-Where the pulse originated from! You could tag along...then again, Lightning was heading off behind one of the bleachers, a determined look on her face, the pink magic following her eagerly

[A) Tag along with Rainbow
 B) Sneak after Lightning]



(Fucking long one sorry)


[Probably last one for today. Hopefully the thread is around when I wake up. Hope peeps are enjoying.]

It's easy to creep after Lightning. It's not like she's subtle although she does throw a few shifty looks over her shoulder. Still, you manage to stay out of sight as the small woman tucks out of sight. She unslings a small sports bag she was carrying over her shoulder and opens it, biting her lip and shuddering slightly as a soft pink light begins to spill out of it. She shuts it quickly and with another quick, darting look she quickly shucks off her loose fitting shorts, leaving her in a pair of bright yellow panties. With a determined sigh as if she's trying to psyche herself up, she quickly strips her panties off as well. Leaving her naked, her short yet toned legs trailing up to a toned rear, lightning bolt cutie mark exposed. 

Her small quim, framed with a short tuft of golden hair is glistening and she moans softly as she reaches into the bag again and quickly yanks out a pair of bright pink sports trunks. 

The trunks beam with the purplish pink magic and despite the distance, you feel your breath hitch as your pussy warms once more. Lightning, gritting her teeth and trembling against her own lustful urges, quickly puts them on. Sighing in pleasure as they slide up legs and letting out a very girlish squeal as they slide up to her pussy. She shoves her fist into her mouth as the stretchy lycra shorts seem to shift and move, tightening around the girl's legs and ass. Her pussy and ass outlined in lurid detail and then-

'Ooooh~' Lightning moans as she grows slightly, not by much, just a few inches to her legs, her stride lengthening as her knees slam together. 'Ooh fuck-' Her glutes firm, the shorts stretching, showing two perfectly firmed globes of ass tight enough to bounce a quarter off!

She breathes heavily, leaning against the bleachers before suddenly springing up, a delirious grin on her face as she does a few experimental bounces, a few mini sprints with her new, longer and more powerful legs-

'Yesss! Suck it Rainbow-Ah!' She cuts off suddenly, biting her lip and you can see a definite flash of lust in her eyes, her toungue darting out and running over her lips. 

You wonder what exactly Lightning was imagining Rainbow "sucking."

'Ooohkay-Keep it together Lightning-Just one race and you can shove them in a drawer and forget about them-'

Well...This was a development...

It occurs to you that Lightning might be...vulnerable in this state. Not just for a direct confrontation and maybe some questioning but she's a veritable font of magic at the moment and her defences are lowered!

Those tight little shorts seem to be powered as well-You might be able to disenchant them and nab that little spell for yourself...or maybe you wanted to add a little somthing somthing to them yourself...Give the cheater a little more than she bargained for? You don't know the ins and outs of the spell on the shorts but you could expend a little mana and give it a *boost?*

You swallow, brow furrowing in concentration as you carefully weave the spell of arousal. However instead of using your own inbuilt pool of mana, you  tap into the buzzing, alluring magic around Lightning. You thread it through yourself and immediately gasp as you take it into yourself. 

You feel buoyed up by the cosy feeling of a warm hug, your troubles, Starveheart, The Queen, and any thoughts of conquest seem to float away. It would be much easier just to stay here and have some fun! You fight against them, trying to stopper the flow as the cold calculating part of your mind rebels. 

The warm content feeling flows through your mind, warping slightly as what "Fun" you could have begins to twist into decidedly naughty. The warm hug feeling becomes more of a caress...

You feel a burning between your legs that spreads across your own rear and legs. Your twiggy legs fill with a modicum of definition, not enough to even come close to matching Dust and Dash but more than your *had*. You reckon you could actually run without falling over from exhaustion. Your rear also perks up, filling out slighty beneath your light blue skirt. You shiver, as the spell releases and your whole body aglow.

After that, you waste no time-

Your spell, infused with light hits Lightning in the ass as she's trying to pull her baggy shorts on over the tight pink ones. She moans loudly and stumbles, one foot in the baggy shorts as they slide back down her knees.

'What? Oh fuckkk-' She gasps, 'Quit it!' She scolds the shorts as they glow softly. She shoves her hand down the front of them. If you're being generous you could say she was adjusting them but more likely she's just slipped a finger into herself-

She checks her watch, wondering if she has time for a quick frig before running the race but she's interrupted by you-

She looks up, shocked and guilty, pulling her glistening hand out from her tight undershorts and tries to yank the sensible black ones up her legs-

'Oh fuck! What the fuck are you doing back here?' She huffs, covering her guilt and arousal with anger. 'Get back to the group, Can't a girl get a moment of privacy?'

You sense she is *really* horny. Perhaps you could use that?


[Self: 
Bimbo Acolyte - This is probably fine...
[*----]


A) Hard approach. Question aggressively. Use her arousal to get answers. Probably won't endear yourself to her but will probably get the most answers in the time you have.
B) Soft approach. Question Softly. Enflame her arousal and see if you can tease the answers out of her. Won't get as many answers in the short term but you might make a friend!

--------------------------------------

'I-I saw you change-' You gasp, making your voice soft and questioning rather than aggressive, working the shy shrinking violet angle. You have a feeling that any act of aggression would probably  be only responded in kind by the proud athlete. Instead you go for the soft approach, stepping closer while pushing ekeking out a little more power into the spell.

You have a feeling that Lightning probably likes to be the one in charge and acting the submissive while she's this horned up might help establish a link. 

'I-Ah!' She grits her teeth, fighting the boiling pot of arousal she's feeling and tries to pull her shorts up again, the elastic waistband struggling slightly. 

'I don't know what you're talking about!' Lightning says, eyes darting nervously, she opens her mouth to say somthing further,

'I won't tell anyone.' You say quickly, projecting just the right amount of awed interest and taking another step closer, wringing your hands in front of you. You also subtly thrust your chest out, the tight, dark green sweater vest framing a small but perky chest.

Lightning's eyes flick down to it and she licks her lips, eyes dilating slighty as she licks her lips, not quite a leer but more than a casual interest. She's suddenly not as focused on pulling her shorts up.

Jackpot

The yellow haired woman shakes her head briskly, opening her mouth to snap somthing else before shutting it with a click.

Finally,

'Thanks.'

There's a moments silence before,

'Look-It's not cheating. I'm just evening the playing field! I used to win all the time! We were a pair! And then-'

'and then she got magic?' You say, egging on her feelings of resentment and sending another flare of arousal to her quim.

'Yeah! Then suddenly she's got a whole bunch of new friends and she's leaving me in the dirt!'

'That's unfair.' You coo, taking another step forward, hands behind your back and eyes as doe-eyed as possible, 'It's not right she just made you the rebound girl...'

'I wasn't the rebound girl!' She snaps before shutting her mouth again, her eyes lowering, 'I guess I was...'

She sighs and seems to deflate, shoulders hunching, 'Eh...I wasn't a very good friend...We only met because she was manipulated into blowing off her other friends by Sunset...'

You reach out and place a hand on her shoulder, 
'Still...'

'I just wanted a taste of the old days I guess...' She says morosely, 'Ah shit! This was so stupid!' 

She shucks off her shorts again and half pulls down the pink trunks before her eyes go wide, remembering that you're here and she's essentially stripping in front of you!

'Shit-Uh...Gossamer, right?' She says, half frozen as she pulls the tight trunks down her toned legs. She looks torn about whether she wants you to leave or continue to watch...

Residual effects of the bimbo magic making her more flighty, your magic or maybe she's just more open with nudity than others?

A) Stay, quiz her about the shorts. There might be more to learn and sexy fun times might release more bimbo-magic unpredictably! 
B) Stay, Make a move. She'll probably be receptive and you'll have a *much* closer vantage on those magical ass huggers!
C) Leave, Watch what she does with the shorts. You might be able to nab them later!
D) Leave but disenchant the shorts, nabbing the spell for your own repertoire.
E) Throw a little more magic in them pants!
F) Other

Or a combination of above?

(Just for a bit of clearance, again I want to stay away from the crunch as best as I can. The Bimbo Booty shorts are an ITEM OF POWER. These are pre-enchanted items that generate their own mana. Meaning the spell on them "Body Mod -  Fitness" is permanent and does not need to reapplied at the cost of mana, unlike your own minor enchantment spell. There is an initial enchantment cost though, expending one mana for each spell you throw on them.

If you disenchant them, you gain "Body mod - Fitness" for your spellbook but they lose the self regeneration aspect. You can also stack affects on ITEMS OF POWER unlike minor enchanted items that you create yourself.

This might not be so useful to you now as your spell book is limited. You could chuck a decrease inhibitions or increase arousal on them but they already do that pretty well themselves. You could throw an aura of normality on their if you were inclined and stealth any changes. The Magus is big on interacting with these ITEMS OF POWER, unlike the Alchemist and the Infiltrator who would probably be more about working around them.

Final Note: I'm bad at thinking of choices(Not good for a CYOA) so if you guys can think of anything you want to throw into F) then be my guest! )


 [Locked in - A) wins with two votes! Quiz her about the shorts.]
You resist the urge to jump Lightning with a great deal more difficulty than you would like. Hive Damn It, even though you've only tasted it slighty, the giggling pink magic continues to push you to think with your pussy before your mind!

Still, you are a master of your own body as well as your mind and with a few deep breaths you regain control of yourself just in time to watch Lightning, with another furious blush of pleasure yank of the shorts and shove them in her sports bag. You can still feel them, the energy pushing to get out however they seem somewhat spent on firming up Lightning's ass.

She quickly pulls her black shorts all the way back up, forgetting to put her other	 panties back on you notice...

You stand quietly, still the picture of the quiet confidante, peeking through the bleachers as a lookout-

'We clear?' Lightning says, coming up behind you and you feel through your bond she's still incredibly aroused but seems to be the kind to burn off her frustrations through exercise if she can't do somthing more personal...

'Yeah-' You briefly wonder what's keeping Ms Harshwhinny. Maybe she's having her own frustrations after her blast with the rogue magic...

The both of you dart out from behind the bleachers and begin making your way back to the group,

'So...Um...Where did you get them?'

'What?'

'The shorts...They, Um They're obviously the catalyst-'

'Obviously?' Lightning says, her eyes narrowing in suspicion at your reach.

Shit. To far. You're not used to dealing with people who can't see the arcane ebb and flow. To Lightning and everyone else, they just look like pair of pink undershorts...

Granted some very pink ones...

You never normally would have made this blunder. Is it exhaustion, stress at being chased or is the bimbo-magic messing with your head. You can still feel it after burning through it to cast your spell. It's attached itself to your own mana reservoir...Just a small blot of it but it's there...

'Well-Um, You put them on and then um...things happened-' You once again play up your unsure companion façade, 'and um-they don't really look like your style?' You add meekly as she continues to stare.

You wonder if she's normally this on edge or if she knows somthing you don't...Somthing that's got her spooked?

Her suspicion fades slightly but doesn't totally abate. She's quiet for some time and you catch sight of Rainbow Dash in the middle distance, Her arms folded as she taps her foot impatiently.

'There...There was a woman-' Lightning swallows and you feel a burst of lust flare up in Lightning as she says "Woman"

As well as a twinge of fear...

'I ran into her during my morning run, on the outskirts of Whitetail Woods...She said she knew how I was feeling...about Rainb-Ahem-about stuff...She gave me the pants, said they would fix things...'

You stare at her, incredulous,

'and that wasn't the least bit strange?'

'Well-Yeah-I thought she was a dealer at first, I was going to deck her before she started her spiel...'

'and you just believed her-' Your breath catches as a thought flits across your mind-

"Minor Truth." You knew the spell but hadn't been able to quite translate it into working in the human world. But it sounded like someone had...

Lightning didn't seem like the type to take strange shorts off a mystery forest women, no matter how hot she thought they were...

She was cocksure, arrogant but not gullible...

Lightning continues, 

'Yeah, I guess-' She says, her voice sounding unsure as her mind grapples with the spell, 'but I mean, what did I have to lose right? They're cute shorts!' Her voice changes at the last sentence becoming airy and bubbly and totally unlike Lightnings usual voice. A wisp of magic flows across her eyes, an echo of the enchantment placed on her?

'-God, I'm not sure why I'm telling you all this...' 

You could guess, it's possible if their is some strange sexy lady going around distributing incredibly powerful items. It might help to have your "customers" advertise if someone asks...

It occurs to you, you might be able to help  here. 
For the given value of what you consider help and who exactly you're helping...
Also, Lightning spooked and looking for a friend, maybe a bit of honesty about who you are, (with a few details twisted) might go a long way. Blagging yourself as a friendly magic user would alleviate her suspicions as well...

Still, Starveheart is still out there, and so will Honourheart as well sooner rather than later...Plus this third person who may or may not be hostle but is certainly more powerful than you at present

The more a secret is spread, the harder it is to keep...

Lightning Dust Bond:
[*----] You're name's Gossamer or somthing?

HONESTY
1A) Keep quiet. Lightning's a loudmouth.
1B) Lie, You're from Equestria, Investigating Rogue Magic and Changelings.
1C) The whole truth. You're a baddie and you want to rule the world. Why would you do this.

MAGIC
2A - Disenchant Lightning. Remove the Minor Truth. She'll realise what's happened. You'll have removed an agent of Shadowy Hot Lady and thwarted her plans. But Lightning will probably run to Sunset and Co.
2B - Do Nothing. You're not sure how much control Shadowy Hot Lady has over Lightning or what other spells she's cast but you've no reason to suspect she knows about you. It's probably best not to tip your hand.

Locked in 1B/2A

You stop Lightning just before you make it back to Rainbow and the rest, taking her by the arm and looking into her eyes with every ounce of faux-sincerity you can conjure. Reel her in with kernels of truth, like breadcrumbs and soon you'll have her eating out of your hand

'Lightning-' You say intensely before looking down, outwardly nervous, trying to draw out her curiosity. 

'Look-I'm going to need you to trust me. I didn't just stumble onto you-' You say, using a little of your limited shapechanging magic to blush on command, looking embarrassed at the memory.

Lightning blushes in embarrassment also, as well as arousal. Your spell is still raging through her and she looks as if she'd rather be doing other things...

'I'm-I'm from the other side of the mirror-' You say, still acting nervous. In fact it wasn't just acting. This could still go wrong quite easily.

Lightning's eyes widen in shock and more than a little fear and she opens her mouth, but you cut her off quickly, the words spilling from your mouth-

'I'm here to help, I'll explain later-Look-I think that woman did somthing to you. Think about it. Think about what you just told me. I know you know it doesn't make any sense! W-Will you let me help you?' 

You say, raising a hand and allowing Lightning to see the soft green glow emanate from your palm. Her mouth drops open and she takes a step back, looking over her shoulders in an manner bordering on panicky.

Rainbow and the rest of the group haven't seen you guys yet and Lightning's face is a war of conflicting emotions. Not all of them her own either...
