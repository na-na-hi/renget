>life hadn't changed as much on earth as one would have thought with aliens
>the planet didn't end up flying into panic
>everyone had kept their fingers on the triggers but nothing ended up happening
>at least that's what the history recordings said in school
>earth just became a trading post
>we didn't have many inhabitants around and multiple races found the planet interesting, but shockingly, not a threat
>maybe we weren't
>strange thing was the races ended up going native here and there
>humans ended up having the innate talent for not really caring where they stuck their penises/vaginas
>it was a rarity among the stars
>so that was humanity's hat
>big scary killing machines that also appeased sexual deviants throughout the stellar community
>earth governments sort of rolled with it
>hard not to with no real way to oppose races eith tech eons past ours
>we were in the midst of colonizing Mars when they showed us faster than light travel
>overnight we had secret alien sugar daddies who wanted a cabin in New Canada with a life partner named Steve
>or whatever floated their boat
>that led to you
>roughly 2 centuries after the planet was discovered and became a teeming port for all manner of space faring races
>you were young
>had money in your pocket
>bored on a Friday night
>as much as things change, they stay the same
>you were at a bar
>two drinks in
>eyeing the cute green thing dancing to the music
>not a care in the world
>you were working up the nerve to show off Terran diplomacy in its finest form
>occasionally the bar tender would roll over to check the status of your glass
>blurt out the electric facsimile of a demand to know if you wanted another
>music throbbed in your skull
>that dancer out on the floor was not particularly graceful
>but the xeno was by themselves
>opportunity

>you hadn't the faintest clue what they were
>it was a race that vaguely resembled an earth mantis
>obviously humanoid
>green exoskeleton plates formed a natural armor, clothes or the modesty to wear them apparently not needed
>perhaps a cultural thing
>hard to say
>the exoskeleton meant they technically weren't in the nude
>normally bugs would turn off people
>you'd heard horror stories of weird bedroom habits or live in situations
>plus there was just the assumption based off earth life
>hard to see something that looks like a giant spider and not apply it to a race of giant arachnids
>here though, you weren't really seeing a threat
>they came up to your shoulder at best
>no blade like limbs
>just arms awkwardly flailing around
>you knocked back another drink
>humans were sort of unique compared to most other sentients in the galactic theater
>most races didn't start off as persistence hunters
>patience wasn't a uniquely human characteristic but it was one they were good at
>it had been brought up before
>you'd bide your time
>try to put on the charm
>in a minute or two
>hunter you may be, rejection was a bitch
>so maybe despite all the macho man "monkey run up to bug and smash" inner pep talks you were tense
>worst she could say is no, right?

>five drinks into some blue liquor and you were ready
>it was game time
>you were going to treat the bug lady to a magical evening and you were hoping she didn't eat your head like you'd seen of earth bugs on the historic videos
>you were ready
>you were mean
>you were...
>no
>fuck it
>you wouldn't screw it up
>you paid your tab to the bar tender machine
>then focused on the task at hand
>you formulated a game plan
>would she respond well to compliments?
>did she speak your language?
>you wouldn't get far if you had to rely of a series of clicks and chirps
>but you had to grab life by the balls
>that liquid courage ran through your body like fire
>she finally broke the dance when you approached
>you worried you made a bad move when she paused but went forward anyways
>the xeno had her yellow eyes on you
>they weren't like a bug's
>at least from what you could tell
>she'd been so lost in the music she had them closed the whole time
>no idea how she hadn't knocked over a waitress
>you tried not to be a creep and stare
>instead, you laid on the charm best you could and asked if she'd like to dance with you
>she agreed
>one step down
>you'd make a fool of yourself out here but maybe you'd get lucky tonight
