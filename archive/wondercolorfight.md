I wanna preface this little discovery of mine by claiming that this isn't anything particularly important. It's not a hidden Holy Grail of gaming or anything like that - just a little 
completely undocumented game with some... bizarre elements.

I'll keep the introductions short, since this is my first [and probably last] post here. My name is Maxim. I'm a 20 year old Russian guy, and I like to collect unlicensed games. I started
when I was a teen, as some sort of joke, but then it just grew on me. Collecting and documenting those practically unknown games for the Internet to see is something I quite enjoy.

Either way, this happened only a week ago or so. I had gotten back in contact with one of my cousins, and during one of our phone calls he brought up my hobby for collecting those bootlegs.
He said he had a box of old shitty NES games that he doesn't want anymore, and he thought I might be interested. Of course, I accepted - possible new discoveries for free? Why would I turn
that down?

Some time later, the box arrived via mail. There were less games than I expected, but I'm not one to look a gift horse in the mouth. The only thing that caught my eye was a green cartridge.
It had a clear shell, and the sticker was torn off, so the game's name, "Wonder Color Fight" was scribbled on with a marker. I had never heard of that game before. Usually, bootleg games
are based on legitimate videogame series, but the name didn't ring any bells, so I concluded it must've been original, atleast in name.

So I shoved it in my NES, and... nothing happened. I blew on the cartridge and checked if the cartridge tray was dusty or anything, but all seemed fine. I decided to give it a go 
with my Famicom instead, and to my surprise it actually worked. A bit bizarre, seeing how these were usually aimed for the Western market. 

The title screen showed up. "WONDER FIGHT COLOR" was written in a quite frankly less-than-pleasing verdant pallette. Nothing else was onscreen, so I decided to press start, and the game 
begun. I was some sort of blue dog head on short, stout humanoid body - no clue what the character's meant to be. The background was a crudely drawn forest using mostly bizarre shades of 
red. I could walk, jump, and punch. After walking to the right for a bit, I met my first enemy - some red creature. The pallette and horrible sprite art made it practically impossible
to actually tell what it is.
 
I tried to punch it, but not surprisingly the hitboxes were absolutely bullshit, so I got hit quite a few times. My health was portrayed in the top left of the screen with three blue hearts. Oddly, getting hit made them turn red instead of disappear. Out of desperation, I tried jumping on the enemy Mario style. This surprisingly worked: instead of dying, however,
the enemy turned the same pallette as me and stopped attacking. 

At this point I realized what was going on: it's some sort of "color conversion" game, hence the title, bizarre pallettes and my hearts turning red. Either way, the level was mostly a straight line with very little in the way of actual platforming. However, here's the most interesting part. 

I started backtracking, planning to snap some pictures of the game, when I saw it. An extremely tall green sprite staring right at my character. It was fully green, like the pallette was glitched, aside from two dot eyes. Upon it appearing, the game was afflicted with downright vile slowdown and sprite flickering - I'm guessing it's because of the character's size.

It didn't move, and looked way too tall to jump on, so I thought it must've been some sort of roadblock and that was what the punch was for. To my surprise, though, I couldn't interact with it in any way - I could even walk right thru it. Maybe it was some sort of easter egg or foreshadowing - but that was unlikely, as those games aren't known for having thought put into them.

The game went on like this for a while. Just walking to the right, sometimes jumping over generic blocks, and converting red garbled sprite enemies to blue. I met that green figure multiple
times, every single time exhibiting the same behavior as before. However, the fourth stage was a bit different. The background was blue, like my character, and no enemies were to be found.
Not even the green figure upon backtracking was there. Finally, I came to face with what I assumed was the final (and only) boss.

It was my player character, colored red. 

Upon seeing me, it immediately started running, to which I gave chase. The level layout was surprisingly way more platformer-y, and I gathered the goal was to stop my clone. Eventually, I got ahead of him, and jumped from a platform onto his head. He turned blue, and then completely disappeared. 

With the boss defeated, the game seemed to just loop back to level one. Not surprising, considering bootleg games often recycled levels or had no proper ending, but this time something was different. The background was colored green, and no enemies were to be found. Just that green figure. Or rather, those green figures, as there were many of them, each one seemingly replacing an enemy. At first I thought I could finally defeat them now that I've beaten every red enemy, but to my surprise, I still couldn't interact with them. 

The most odd part was that there was no more slowdown, and no sprite flickering. This was really odd - if a single tall green figure was enough to slow down the game before, why don't many of them do the same? The figures were unresponsive as always, simply staring me down as I slowly walked to the end of the level. I was expecting the next level to be a similar green takeover, but something else happened.

It was an entirely pitch black level, in sharp contrast to the game's color theme. The only thing onscreen was one of those green figures, in the middle - replacing my player character. All I could do as it was walk to the right. And walk I did. After a while, I reached another figure. It looked had the same sprite as the green ones, but this time it was blue. A single green line of dialogue in surprisingly poor Russian appeared. "YOU'RE LOSE! GREEN IS NOT WIN COLOR". The game ended with a credits screen, crediting only 4 people by given name.

For a few days I spent most of my time trying to wrap my head around what this meant. Was there a way to convert the green ones? Did I miss a secret ending? Are there more levels or bosses? Why does this not work on a western console despite being made for the western market? As you probably noticed by now, this game raises a lot of questions. And if you read this far for answers, I am sorry, but I believe there really are none. I searched every nook and cranny ingame, played with friends, and even had a pal of mine snoop thru the files. There really isn't anything else to the game. You can't 'win' against the green figures, and there's no way to change the ending. 

I know there's not much to this game, but I really wanted to share it with the Internet. I feel like it's the kind of oddity a few people could get some kicks out of. But really, that's it. I'm putting this out in the hopes that one of the seemingly four people that worked on this reaches out to me - I'd really like to know what any of this means.
