The particular brand of chemistry between Kronii and Ina came as a surprise to many viewers. Both of them were self-admitted introverts and tended towards the quieter side during group collabs, yet, when put together, they effortlessly teased and bantered with one another like close friends. 

Tonight was one such occasion. The game of choice was a puzzle platformer where both player characters were linked by a length of rope, prime material for their budding rapport.

“Wow, you really fell off there? This part’s not even that hard, just play better.”

Ina leaned forward and tightened the grip on her controller. “Ah…my brain’s still warming up. Let’s go again.”

“If you need me to play for you, just let me know,” Kronii continued with audible smugness. “I am perfect, after all.”

Ina had been made well aware of that assertion tonight since it seemed to come up every five minutes. A certain amount of preening was to be expected– it was a central pillar of Kronii’s persona alongside offhand comments about depression, but even used ironically it had overstayed its welcome.

To her credit, Ina just laughed and played along, deflecting her minor frustrations through puns for the sake of the viewer's experience.

The real problem only appeared during their first exploratory steps into the level themed around dreams. All the pillows and mattresses they were platforming over soon led to the topic of bedrooms and, more specifically, the state of Myth’s sleeping arrangements.

“Hey, you said you like sleeping on the floor, right?”

“Mmm, these days, yeah. It just feels more comfortable.”

Kronii giggled and spun her character in circles. “Yeah? Do you even have room to lie down with all the garbage covering your floor?”

“It’s not that bad! It was just a few delivery boxes I forgot to throw out!” Ina responded, her voice clearly flustered.

Kronii erupted into full blown laughter. “Noo, hold on, I’ve seen your room! That place was *carpeted* with trash bags! It looked like you had to wade through it to get to your desk!”

Ina was speechless, tongue tied between warring feelings of embarrassment and betrayal. She had shared those pictures over Discord in confidence, yet Kronii apparently didn’t have any qualms about airing them out for content. 

“And *man*, when we all met up at the hotel with Ame, I could smell you coming from down the hall! I know it was just us girls, but you were *ripe*!”

Ina blushed furiously behind the screen and tried to jettison the conversation. “O-oi! Don’t make me come over there and bonk you! Let’s just focus on the game…”

Tellingly, Ina didn’t deny it. Her personal habits (and personal hygiene) were hypothesized, though never explicitly confirmed by an outside source until now.

The tension in the air and faltering in Ina’s voice finally got through to Kronii; she had severely overstepped in her playful teasing and needed to pull back.

“I’m *kidding*, I’m kidding!” Kronii cleared her throat and backpedaled with all her strength. “Ina smelled very…um, she smelled…okay.”

Well, that didn't help.

The correct choice would have been “like flowers” or some sort of fruity shampoo. At the very least she could have defaulted to “normal”, but Ina’s scent was so far on the other side of the scale that none of those adjectives even sprung to mind.

Naturally, chat was having a field day with this unexpected lore dump.

`my tako can’t be this stinky…`
`INA LMAO`
`wait does she actually not shower?`
`Ina…`
`AYO WHAT`
`was it actually that bad lol`

Liters of premium gasoline had been poured on the “Ina’s a sloppy NEET” fire. The current audience and VOD watchers alike would inevitably take great joy in running that joke into the ground across every facet of social media. Much in the same way Ina never showed her forehead on stream, she would be busy responding to and chasitising dozens of superchats taking “subtle” jabs at her hygiene for the next couple of months. 

The hours following that exchange were quieter than usual. Ina’s mind was clearly elsewhere, mulling on the verbal evisceration her friend had just performed. To everyone’s relief, Ina’s spirits did pick up towards the end. Though not because she had forgiven Kronii, but because she had thought of a way to vent her frustration.

–

One week later, Kronii rapped upon the unassuming door to Ina’s apartment. The invitation she had received was short and warm, a simple request for an off collab at her place, and Kronii welcomed the opportunity to apologize in person.

The timing was strange though. On Saturdays Ina usually kept off the clock, preferring instead to laze about for hours upon hours of video gaming. A certain MMO had been taking the glut of her attention as of late and Kronii couldn’t imagine her breaking off such an addiction so suddenly.

Stranger still, this collab wasn’t on either of their schedules. Guerilla streams are fine, but they’re usually reserved for solo acts.

*Well, maybe she just really likes playing with me. Not that I can blame her.*

Kronii knocked once more. No answer. She was pulling out her cell phone when a soft voice called out from behind the door.

“It’s open! Sorry, I’m still getting ready, but you can come in.”

*Sleeping through her alarms? Why am I not surprised?*

Kronii pushed open the door and passed inside. As soon as it closed behind her, cold fear crawled up the back of her neck. *Something’s wrong*, her instincts whispered, *you shouldn’t be here.*

“Um, hello? Ina?” She pushed her anxiety aside and followed the narrow entryway further inside. Everything was so dark. The ceiling lights hung cold and lifeless, and heavy blackout curtains smothered the morning sunshine. The soft hum of Ina’s computer whirred from the corner, the only sound to distract Kronii from her own shallow breathing.

Her eyes caught a lumpy mass of wool blankets and thick comforters shifting on Ina’s floor. Forget “getting ready”, Ina hadn’t even gotten out of bed.

“Mnngh...” Ina stirred in her half-sleep and ruffled the discolored bed sheets cocooning her slender form. She shoved the sheets off in a huff and sat up on her knees, releasing an immense rolling cloud of aerosolized musk and perspiration into the room. From head to toe, the priestesses gleamed with a sticky film of overnight sweat. “Ah, good morning, Kronii,” Ina mumbled out between yawns.

“Kroyasumi,” Kronii replied, the anchoring feeling of dread growing larger in the pit of her stomach as the smell drifted over her like morning fog. She fought hard not to pinch her nose. “If you’re still waking up, I can wait outsi…” Kronii’s words trailed off as Ina got to her feet and presented her shockingly disheveled body.

A flimsy white t-shirt sat atop Ina’s lithe frame, the material so thin and airy that one could see the small peaks of her A-cup nipples poking against the fabric. Her chest, bra-less and flat as a board, flowed down to her slender waist before flaring out into wide hips and a thick, meaty backside at extreme odds with her other measurements. It was as if all the fat taken from her tits wound up filling out her giant ass and blessing the priestess with a perfectly bottom-heavy figure that strained against her dark purple panties– the only other article of clothing to speak of.

Both pieces looked worse for wear. Blotchy sweat stains marred every inch of Ina’s shirt, especially concentrated around the pits, and the crotch of her low rise panties featured an intensely dark stain glistening with her juices.

Yet easily the most obscene feature was Ina’s massive, unshaven bush, so full and thick that fringes of sweaty pubes spilled out from her panties and tickled her inner thighs. Drops of salty musk and sweat slid down her legs to join the damp bedding at her feet.

Unfazed by her atrocious demeanor, Ina let loose another weary yawn and scratched her armpit. Getting up before noon was always such a hassle.

“Sorry I took so long. I had ten different alarms set but I’ve gotten too good at turning them off. Ahh, that was not a skill I asked for…”

Kronii was in no headspace to laugh along, and was instead slowly backing her way towards the door. As her eyes adjusted to the dim light, the state of Ina’s accommodations grew distressingly clear and her anxiety returned in full force.

Ina’s bedroom was, in a word, disastrous. Grocery bags full of electronics packaging and delivery receipts lie strewn about the floor like bloated mushrooms. Sheets, throw pillows, and blankets were flung over dressers and shoved under cabinets. But the worst offender to her senses was the filthy, reeking items of old laundry draped across the landscape. The fermenting body odor held within those tortured fabrics bled into the stuffy air and nearly stunned Kronii in place. This wasn’t a case of skipping laundry day; these clothes had assuredly not known the touch of soap or water in months. And while there were a fair amount of hoodies, shorts, and skirts, Kronii didn’t spy a single pair of underwear other than the ones wrangled around Ina’s fat ass. Surely they were just buried somewhere else, right? There’s no way Ina would have only one pair…

“No, it’s fine, I should give you some time to get ready,” Kronii insisted, reaching back for the door handle. As soon as she was outside, she’d bolt for her house and take the longest shower of her life. Or maybe jump into a river on the way there, anything to wash this cloying funk off her skin.

The doorknob didn’t move. “*Huh?* Kronii looked down in disbelief. It wasn’t locked, that much was clear, but it felt solid in her hand like it was a decorative piece carved into the door.

Behind her, Ina’s lips curled into a sleepy smile. “Oya, oya, my cute little kohai’s trying to leave already?”

“W-what did you do?” It took everything Kronii had not to collapse into blind panic. It wasn’t just the door now; her entire body wasn’t moving, like corded steel wires had slid between her muscles and bones.

What Kronii was experiencing was the touch of the Old Ones. They were existences from beyond the fifth wall that could shatter minds and bend reality into paper airplanes by merely opening one of their trillion eyes. Manipulating one human body, Warden of Time or otherwise, was a trivial ask. 

Ina ignored Kronii’s question and gestured to her desk. “Come on, you can set up over there. I still gotta eat breakfast but I’ll be over soon.”

Kronii’s body lurched forward like a wind up doll, her gait stiff and unnatural. “Wait! Stop it! What are you doing?” Her mouth and her mind were free to protest, but those entities weren’t of any real consequence anymore.

Her march terminated a few inches away from the edge of Ina’s desk. In the shadowed space below were large, squared-shaped plastic bottles, packed tightly against one another and filled to the neck with clouded amber liquids.

The alien force then dropped Kronii to her knees, and began crawling her body forward. 

*No! No! Stop!* She needed to rewind, to shift back to before she ever came here. Kronii closed her eyes and focused her energy. Golden strands shone like collapsing stars all around her, enveloping her in a pillar of celestial light. There wasn’t any time to be precise, so the deafening gale of tearing recklessly through spacetime rang in her ears as she forced every atom in her body into the past.

The world went white and the roar faltered to a low, rumbling hum.

When she opened her eyes, she found darkness. In front of her was the same cluttered desk in the same dingy bedroom. She had failed. Ina’s power was absolute, and Kronii’s subservience was sealed with such finality that the heat death of the universe wouldn’t sever its terms. Control of time meant nothing in a realm born of eternity.

With Kronii’s will to resist neatly shattered, the invisible presence finished stuffing her busty frame beneath Ina’s desk. As expected, it was a tight fit. The crouching position left her heavy, hanging breasts pressed and flattened against her knees. The outside of her thighs were accosted by Ina’s improvised toilets and she felt their unsettling warmth press into her skin.

Ina finished her breakfast– two cans of Dr. Oopsie, an espresso, and some cookies, and returned to her desk. The smell emanating from her lower body got exponentially stronger the closer she came. Upon reaching her destination, she bent at the waist and gave Kronii an enthusiastic “Wah!” alongside a wave.

Kronii’s razor sharp glare glowed from the shadows like a wounded animal, equal parts anger and humiliation. It was quite amusing to witness The Warden of Time, the supposed all-powerful embodiment of one of our reality’s fundamental concepts, slouched over beneath a hikki’s desk and surrounded by stale jugs of piss. 

“Guess we should get started. It’s gonna be a long day, afterall.”

Ina started lowering herself into her seat but stopped halfway. “Ah, wait…lemme just get these out of the way.” Ina hooked her thumbs under her waistband and slowly removed, or more accurately, *unstuck* her panties from the tangled jungle of pubes smothering her crotch. She shifted and wiggled on her feet while deftly maneuvering her underwear down her thighs, giving Kronii an eyeful of her garment’s abuse.The insides of Ina’s panties were steaming, dripping wet, and had patches of flattened pubes still clinging to the warm inner fabric. One glance was all it took to understand how terribly long they’ve been plastered to Ina’s hairy lower lips.

“There…we…go! *Whew!* That’s better!” She dropped her sodden panties from the tips of her fingers and let them splatter against the carpet.

Upon removal, the full, uninhibited musk of Ina’s unwashed bush collided with Kronii’s nostrils, and the warden jerked her head back like someone flashed a knife at her throat. Small tears pricked the corners of her eyes and a sizable dry heave banged her shoulders against the desk’s walls, bumping and sloshing the surrounding bottles of piss. When the initial shock subsided, she was left coughing pathetically within the dense unmoving cloud of Ina’s fermented NEET stench. The odor was so impossibly pungent that it made the rest of the bedroom smell like a brand new linen closet.

Even Ina, to whom the scent would theoretically be the least offensive, wrinkled her nose and turned away. “Ah…I guess it’s- *cough* -been a while,” she mumbled while fanning her stuffy crotch in Kronii’s face. The only time Ina bathed was when she had to meet up with friends or take extended trips outside, and the last time she had to do either of those was…well, she couldn’t remember, but that certainly explained the situation down there. Weeks of lazy hikki days spent drawing on her tablet, playing video games, and plunging oversized dildos up her sex left her with quite the stink. On the bright side, Ina wouldn’t have to endure her smell for much longer.

She slapped her sweaty bare ass down on her streaming chair and spun it towards her computer. Kronii whined under her breath as Ina’s chair rolled forward and sealed her inside, her poor face now tightly sandwiched between Ina’s plump upper thighs and inches away from her reeking bush.

Ina logged on and queued up a Discord call with Sana, who she had recently recruited into playing. Sana was relatively new and there was much to teach her. Fortunately they both had the next ten hours to spare.

“Okay, just a bit more.” She scooted forward another couple of inches and pushed the greasy pubes of her muff against Kronii’s quivering lips while she waited for Sana to join.

Invisible forces kept Kronii frozen in place, letting her face bake in the heat and stench of Ina’s neglected snatch that had been long sweltering within her unventilated, humid bedroom. Kronii couldn’t decide what was worse and kept swapping between breathing through her mouth and her nose, trading the stronger smell for physically tasting Ina’s aroma on her tongue.

Ina could feel Kronii’s panicked breath, short and hot, blowing against her nethers while she browsed her items and equipment. Considering how much Kronii was already struggling, what Ina was about to do seemed like overkill. But then again, this was the impetus for bringing her over in the first place. If Kronii had thought Ina smelled bad during the off collab, after she’d spent half a day doing laundry and scrubbing herself down with basketfuls of freshly purchased shampoos, it was only right to give her a taste of true degeneracy. It was all for the sake of giving Kronii a little perspective, and make her more appreciative of the lengths Ina went to smell “okay”.

Thus, Ina shifted in her seat and dragged one of her legs upwards. Kronii’s eyes lit up, anticipating a change of heart, when Ina’s right leg planted itself above her shoulder and curled behind her neck.

Kronni’s heart rate skyrocketed. “W-what are you doing? I don't-”

Ina swiftly clinched her leg and locked it tight under the crook of her other knee, simultaneously mashing Kronii’s flustered face deep into her hairy, sopping cunt and surrounding the warden’s head in a sweltering prison of supple thigh flesh.

*“Grrmph!”* Kronii’s nose and mouth dove into layers of crotch sweat, girl cum, and unwiped piss, now entirely smothered in Ina’s smelly folds. Her cheeks were painfully smushed together in a grotesque fish-faced expression, and she could feel dense wiry pubes tickling the top of her cheeks. The trauma shocked her into a startled breath, and Kronii drew thick clutches of sweaty pubes right up her nose that smeared the inside of her flaring nostrils with the disgustingly sour pheromones that had been stewing in the depths of Ina’s sweaty forest for *weeks*. Scores of pearl-sized droplets were snorted off the ends of Ina’s pubes before tracing up Kronii’s nasal canal and pelting the back of her throat. She gagged and writhed hard enough to shake the desk off the floor a few centimeters, but her body ultimately went nowhere.

“Huh? Did you say something?” Sana asked, having recently joined the call. 

Ina stifled her laughter. “No, sorry, I was just getting more comfortable.” She further tightened her leg lock in an effort to smother out any more potential interruptions and forced Kronii into an even deeper kiss with her mound. “This-*unf*-chair sometimes makes noises like that.” She punctuated the sentence with an extra long squeeze of her thighs.

Kronii mumbled her extreme displeasure, not that it would do anything. Her face was hopelessly enveloped by Ina’s sweat-streaked thighs and plump, smelly pussy. Beads of shiny sweat rolled down the soft banks of Ina’s thighs and onto Kronii’s face, adding a salty tinge to the pocket of muggy air swirling around her nose. She glared up at her captor with ire, but it was hard to take her seriously with her nose hidden behind a slick mat of dark purple pubes.

Given the pressure bearing down on her skull and neck, Kronii feared the lack of blood flow would soon knock her out. But the reality was far worse. For while she could technically breathe, the immense stench pouring straight down her nose was so vile, so unbelievably pungent, that her consciousness was melting away all the same. Every inhalation drew Ina’s repulsive musk further down her airways, spreading across her brain like a drop of paint dispersing through a bucket of water. The more she huffed her senpai’s unwashed cunt, the shallower her breaths got, until it was hard to tell if she was breathing at all.

It wasn’t long before the world around Kronii melted away into unfocused blobs of color and sound, and she drifted into the sweet mercy of unconsciousness.

–

An indeterminate amount of time passed, and voices rang out from behind the veil. One giggly and full of energy, the other calm with a slight lisp. Kronii could make out only spots of the conversation at first, and then with more clarity.

“Alright, while you get your gear set up, I’m gonna go to a quick idol meeting.”

*Idol…meeting..?*

Kronii felt Ina’s muscles relax slightly and then a warm, tangy liquid trickled down her tongue.

“*Mrrphm?!*” She jolted awake. Kronii’s senses were fully reignited and went to work bringing her up to date with her nightmarish reality.

“Hmm? Oh good, you’re awake. I don’t have to hold it in anymore…” Ina slouched back in her chair and sighed in relief.

The floodgates opened, and Ina’s hairy cunt blasted a fierce smelling piss beam against the back of Kronii’s throat. The surge of liquid waste splashed off her esophagus and swam over her teeth and gums, ensuring not a single millimeter of Kronii’s mouth was left untainted by the priestess’ long-held ambrosia. The stream grew hotter and stronger each passing second while Ina smiled at her from above.

“I didn’t have a chance to go at all yesterday so…I hope you can drink it in *time*!” Ina said with a wink.

Kronii could only gurgle and attempt to wretch her head free. Ina’s stinking hikki piss was sloshing up against the roof of her mouth now, and there was nowhere else for it to go. With a heavy groan of defeat, Kronii opened her throat and guzzled down the first mouthful.

Then another.

And another.

The flow showed no signs of letting up and each gulp tasted worse than the last. Ina had always preferred soda and other caffeinated beverages to anything as exotic as a glass of water (and even then she barely drank enough to stay reasonably hydrated), so her urine was dark yellow and unbearably flavorful. Every swallow stung Kronii’s tongue and throat with its sharp acrid tang.

Ina reclined ever further and absentmindedly scratched her bush, dislodging some stray pubes onto Kronii’s face while she continued emptying her overfull bladder at her leisure. The sheer volume was obscene; ten seconds had passed and Ina was still pissing like a racehorse! While her friend was clearly suffering down there, Ina’s main concern was whether or not she could swallow all of it. It would be a real pain to clean up afterwards. 

Predictably, her human urinal couldn’t keep up and spurts of pee burst out from the wet seal of Kronii’s lips. It splashed safely within the cradle of Ina’s fat thighs and pooled back down around Kronii’s head, soaking into her deep blue hair and rising dangerously close to the bottom of her eyes. Kronii was in mortal hysterics now, her nose blowing tiny bubbles in the rising pool of golden filth while she tried her damndest to chug everything down. Once used for impassioned singing and hours of crowd-pleasing voice acting, the only purpose for Kronii’s throat now was draining Ina’s backed up piss into her stomach.

On the brink of passing out once again, the firehose gushing into her mouth trickled to a halt. Finally, some breathing room. Seven meaty gulps later, Kronii cleared her airways and sucked greedily at Ina’s piss-stained bush for whatever oxygen she could siphon. Her stomach was heavy and sloshing with Ina’s amber refuse but at least she could breathe.

Ina frowned and squirted out another few spurts into Kronii’s mouth, grinding her cunt into her toilet's face for good measure. “Humu, humu…not bad for your first time.” She cracked open another soda from the 12-pack by her keyboard and took a swig. “We’ll go until tomorrow morning…I’ll probably have to use you a couple more times today, so blame Past Ina for drinking so much of this stuff.”

Kronii sighed and fidgeted in place. The thought of choking down her waste even one more time brought her to the edge of tears, but at least her torment would end at daybreak.

–

The sun dipped below the horizon and street lights lining the main road flickered to life outside. Aside from the amount of empty cherry red soda cans cluttering her desk, nothing much had changed inside Ina’s apartment. She still sat comfortably slumped over in her chair as she had that morning, and Kronii’s face was still trapped snugly between her thighs. The warden had been used nine times since the day began, well over the initial estimate, but never quite got the hang of her urinal duties. Ina helpfully reminded her that anything spilled on the carpet would have to be “taken care of” before she could leave.

The frequent pee drinking sessions had been broken up whenever Ina got too caught up in the sensation of Kronii’s tongue lapping up the leftover piss within her folds, and humped the warden’s face like a sex-starved fujo until climaxing in her mouth. The taste wasn’t much better on Kronii’s side, but it at least cleansed her palette somewhat.

“I think that’s it for me, I still need to eat dinner. Thanks for playing with me, Ina! Let’s do this again soon!” Sana signed off, leaving Ina with her only thoughts and an unwilling toilet.

“Ahh, I should eat, too. It’s been what, nine hours?”

Her legs unlocked from behind Kronii’s skull and spread wide under the desk. She rolled her chair back and finally unstuck Kronii’s poor face from her smelly cunt.

The many hours of battery and olfactory overload left Kronii nearly despondent. Thick strings of gooey crotch sweat hung off Kronii’s face, and a nauseating variety of thicker excess liquids  dripped down her cheeks and neck. Dozens of curly, oily pubes were pressed around her nose and mouth, with some even flossed between her teeth and under her tongue. Her eyes were glassy and unfocused, as if her cognizance as a whole had been blown out and smothered under Ina’s sour mind-breaking musk.

After balancing precariously on her knees, Kronii’s limp, unsupported frame fell forward and collapsed face-first into the slimy crotch of Ina’s previously discarded panties. At least her fat tits cushioned the impact somewhat. Ina shrugged and continued on her way to the kitchen to warm up some leftovers. As long as Kronii could breathe, that was as good a place to leave her as any.

*Hmm, it’s a double XP weekend,* Ina pondered while punching in the microwave timer, *...one more day wouldn’t hurt, right?*
