#Ikari Relationship chart:

##S Rank
>Inatsu Hikuhei:

!!! note Venerable third Hokage. As the lady of the Hakumo, I can’t say I have any problems with him, even if our clan doesn’t operate by the Will of Fire or the standard way Konoha nin does. The second wasn’t so understanding of our ways back then…
!!! note He gives us more free ways to use our specialty and use it well. Given the economic boons and more “tribute” given for Konoha on our part, it is unlikely his successors will act dumb with us, lest they commit political suicide.
Smiling darkly, she takes a sip of her cold tea.
!!! note As Ikari, I say he is not as bad as it could be. Entertaining for sure. I’m too young to have known him in his prime, so all I can see is a reasonable leader who is fun to tease over paperwork.

>Yusuke Hiramatsu:

!!! warning As far as I know, the main reason why we don’t have to worry about Sunagakure. For as strong as a Jinchuriki is, they don’t matter much if they are mad dogs. Should Suna want to bite the paw of a predator, they will be destroyed.
!!! warning Should I say I yearn for this? To just go there and destroy everything? HMMM. For a nation of nothing but beggars in a great desert, they are far too arrogant to think to stand in the same league as us. Kill.

##A Rank
>Taiki:

!!! note A dumb oaf, good-natured, and simple. To say I have met the man on more than a handful of occasions is a flat-out lie even to our standards. I know more about his genealogy tree than the man himself should.
!!! note In any case, I doubt we will ever meet each other save those handful of situations. He is a good bachelor, but only this. In a political marriage, he is a wonderful option, too dumb to mess with politics, giving me free rein, and he can provide me with strong heirs.
!!! note Sigh. Outside of this, it wouldn’t be the happiest of marriages, little is what he can provide me besides genetics. Hm? Does he see me as a little sister? Someone he barely met, at best? What is he? Retarded?

>Konna:

!!! warning Amegakure. Heard they are a spiteful bunch. Don’t want to cross paths with someone from such a depressing place, always raining and with bitter and spiteful people. What I heard of his combat capabilities is another factor to avoid a person like him. It simply is not worth it.

>Mika Katsumi:

!!! info Someone interesting, if wasn’t for the lack of tails and ears, and of course, common fucking sense, believe it or not, we have some of these, I would say she is a Hakumo alright.
The wolf maiden giggles.
!!! info In any way, she is a great catch and is the type of girl to join our branch of missions in Konoha, anbu, and black-ops. I hope we can get her into our fold. Sadly we have so few males to marry off…
!!! info I like her spunk, and the way she carries herself. Her head and self-control are not good if her past is anything to go by, but this can be fixed with a Hakumo overseer, Her abilities are simply far too good to pass up. Hihi.

>Kurumi Yamagumo:

!!! danger Despite avoiding getting into other’s business, this one is like a  sore thumb. We had no problem with the little ravens, but this one is hardly something we can support. She smells like corpses, and as such, there is something wrong.
Uncharacteristically, her face snarls, showing a degree of enmity.
!!! danger Something in her is not natural, and this type of thing is an ill omen. A clan leader reflects its subjects. If the clan leader is rotten and spoiled, what does it tell us about their clan?

>Amami Kai:

!!! note The rare times I went to Yashinohagakure, can’t say I met the man. I hate that place. I hate sand, I hate shores, if I would prefer to go to Yukigakure or even the land of Iron, they suit my tastes far more. Oh, what is it about? That monk, yes?
!!! note I hadn’t met him, but have seen some pictures of him back in a fire temple in the Daimyo’s lands. He is not so bad.

>Mutsuo Aburame:

!!! info A power-hungry member of a noble clan, who wants to raise his clan in the hierarchy. Psst. If there is something that centuries in the Daimyo’s court taught us, it is that the only way to rise in power is not only through military merit but commerce. Samurais were merchants when not in wars, after all.
Once again, she takes a sip of her tea, her eyes tired.
!!! info Everyone of those ninja clans sees the rise to power the wrong way, and as such they won’t be able to ever rise from the gutter they are in. Despite Aburame’s clan's good vision, they are far too limited in scope to reach the highs he wants, and far too blinded by power to notice it.

>Goro Tsuchigumo

!!! note For some reason, one of the few clans we get along. Indeed it is fun to think the foxes and spiders are amicable to each other. It may have to do with the fact they are not as conventional as many other clans, also having physical mutations to speak about, like us.

##B Rank:
>Ray Sisuto:

!!! info For some reason, he hates me. No, scrap that. I’m a Hakumo, there is plenty to hate about us. Contrary to what he may think, I hold no ill intention towards him. Although his arts and specialties are meaningless to most of us.
A small smile appears on her lips.
!!! info Our bloodline limit is not a thing that can be “trained”, as he lacks sage chakra he can’t possibly understand and see the world as we do, and we are far too big, and prosperous, to keep a good track of our bloodlines. But if I have to say, it is cute to see him thinking about small victories, when I barely notice them half of the time. Who were those four brats without parents, again?

##C Rank:
>Oscar:

!!! info He is a barbarian, and there are lands far away from the Daimyos’ grasps. It is… reassuring to know there are lands without the bloodstain of Ninja and Samurai legacy,  but they all have their problems as well. Sadly he can’t speak our language well… I would love to compile the tales of his voyages and of “Arucadia”.

>Kambara Soue, “The Busty Ninja”:

!!! warning What? Seriously! Even mine are not that big! Those ice hikers do some kind of foul sorcery to achieve that level! I swear to you! Besides it, it is another shame that I was not born a male, or have a young one to marry off to their clan.
!!! warning I would love to live in those snowy mountains, away from this place, away from the foliage… but alas, it is a shame they also lack a strong husband to offer me. The snowy mountains… how it is to live with nothing but snow around you…?

>Tengu Yumiko:

!!! note A beautiful brat, seeing her squirm and hide her disgust and hatred towards us is fun, too fun. I wonder how fast her dreams will be crushed by this world. Those with honor, ha, and goodwill do not endure as a ninja. This soul corriding job, only by tainting yourself in the darkness of it can you survive, lest you become another body to be shipped off, or desecrated. 

>Kazuo:

!!! note I thought of adding him to my team, but he is too much to deal with, and I lack the expertise to help someone like him when he starts to break down, metaphorically and literally. He deserves a better teacher than me.

>Sarurata:

!!! note Perhaps he is related to Taiki?

>Zeiji Gorobuyo:

!!! info I’m interested in his dreams. How many clans would throw a temper tantrum should he try to achieve it? Doesn’t matter as long as he achieves this dream of his. It would empower the fox clan by leaps and bounds.

>Kenzo:

!!! note Despite his walled punching appetite, he appears to be in the right direction for the younger generation. Medic nin, who are good at their job are rare, to see someone so talented taking this path is… heartwarming.

##Team 9:
>Nara Suzura

!!! note My most problematic kit, right now. To see the Nara do this to their flesh… to their blood is infuriating. For as mischievous and cruel as we may be, even we have limits to our blood kin.
The Hakumo Lady frowns in fury and outrage, before snapping back in a calm facade, but the start of a snarl appears on her lips.
!!! note We have limits, we treat our kits well, orphan or not, from the Inari, Yako, and other families as well. Our children are sacred, children are sacred and this is why it pains me to see Genin too young sent to die, yet there is nothing I can do about it.
She sighs, looking down at her teacup.
!!! note I guess the reason I took her in is because I see myself in her. Despite my ability as a sage may come in handy to help contain her should she go out of control. I guess… the reason why I want to help her is to not have another one of me running around. I think… retainer, was I always this way?
!!! note Sorry, I’m straying off topic. I want to see her become a person, not a weapon. There are many things I have to fix and help her with… this includes politics as well. I doubt her father will let her become a person and not a weapon.

>Eisen Hokan:

!!! note The one I take pride in knowing is well-adjusted. While the Hokan clan is another noble clan like us, they take care of their children… which is more than many clans can speak about their young.
!!! note He has to walk a hard walk, but not as hard as many will, especially Suzura. His status as a “nerd” will be easy to lift when he becomes a chunin and proves himself, simplistic titles like those disappear fast once he “stops” being a nerd.
!!! note A medic in… he has potential to it, like that kid Kenzo. His… combat prowess leaves much to be desired right now, but I can work it, teach him how to fight from afar, and not fall into the pit traps that are “honorable combat” or “close combat”.
!!! note As a med nin, he won’t have to worry about falling in close combat anyway, and med nin also has ways to compensate for shortcomings in close combat…
A genuine smile appears on her lips.
!!! note Oh my, guess I become too excited talking about his future. I have hopes for him, he proved his ability. I guess my team had the spark for greatness, after all!

>Takatsui Inukasai:

!!! note That kid has an attitude problem, but people with attitude problems are plenty in the Hakumo clan, I just have to work it out of him. Our combat styles also match to a degree, which makes things easy down the line. I can help him enhance his Ink style, and let Ray take care of Blaze style.
She takes a sip of her cold tea.
!!! note While not a true genius, he has the ability and will to succeed. He will achieve great things with that will, if I can fix his attitude. It is daunting to think of someone’s future on my end. Whether he falls in darkness or stays in the light depends on how well I can teach and bestow knowledge… I hope I can be enough.
!!! note Enough to prevent him from falling in the darkness because of an ill-placed tantrum or allure of darkness latching on his ego. Isn’t it pathetic, retainer? I don’t fear a jinchuriki but rather fear a future that may not pass…
!!! info I feel like a fraud, honestly…

>Team 9:
!!! note They are my kits… I don’t know if it is maternal instincts kicking in, or a bleeding heart, but I can’t help but be worried about them, and their future. To want to help them become their best selves… more than I would normally do.
!!! note I heard many teachers just abandon their teams after they graduate… rarely seeing each other. In a way, I think it would be best for them to take this approach with me. I have far too many enemies just for the fact I’m me. I don’t want them to make enemies by association.
!!! Yet, this feeling of disappointment and hollowness stays with me. Fear that they will forget me, that they will abandon me like everyone else did. I don’t want to be abandoned by those kits, the ones I’m training too… in a way I’m seeing them like I see you, my retainer.

##Hakumo facilities:
>Gambling Dens:

!!! info They are gambling dens, although far more advanced than the ones you see in backwater villages. I dare say our dens are better than the ones in the capital! Although we also have many gambling dens under our jurisdiction there as well… you see.
!!! info While people losing money, their possessions, and life there is sad, this is the way of life. If it wasn’t for us, the money and possessions would go to another person, to another gambling den. Better they fall for us, and we acquire their resources, than someone else… This is the way of the merchant and of war as well.

>Whorehouses:

!!! info Those damned… ignore that, almost everyone in this village. They don’t see it as more than a house of prostitutes. While we do sell sexual services, there is much more to it! Our girls and men act as midwives and nurses…
She bites her lips, trembling as she chokes out a scream of anger.
!!! note Midwives and nurses, we also practice traditional medicine, the manufacturing of incense, and talismans. We invest in our whores, they know advanced math, two languages at least… and yet, the image they all have is of dirty prostitutes who only sell sex for cheap, cheap pleasure.
Anger shines in her eyes.
!!! Damned if they are cultured, damned if they know medicine, damned if they are midwives. They are all whores, what do they know about anything but sex? It is so… infuriating.

#Ikari:
“Ah, I see. Me.” All emotion dies in her heart, leaving just an uncomfortable hollowness, a wrenching melancholy scratching at a blackboard. “I guess it is too late for me. Too late for people to change their views.”

The teacup is put aside, and as the Fox sage looks away, she lowers her head on the table, her ears flatten, and her tails fall. “I tried to act nice, to be nicer than our average clanmate, but all they see is a Hakumo still.”

Repressed stress and fatigue start to come out, robbing the regal and witty tone of her voice, leaving only the voice of a twenty-year-old, not the leader of the Hakumo. “Yet all they will ever see is the leader of the Hakumo. Not Ikari, only the fox sage. What weakness and humanity can I show to them? Exploits for my enemies to stab us in the back?”

Slowly but surely, her eyes start to weep. “I’m the inverse of that spider… the inverse. The image of the clan reflects on me, not otherwise.” She clenches her fists, hands trembling, yet feeling so powerless despite the anger fueling them, the bitter and sour taste of worthlessness bleeding her heart dry.

“I wanted… just to be accepted. I wanted a family. This is why I accepted undergoing the sage training, this is why I dedicated my life. To be accepted by our kin, to be adopted in a house… to have a family.” Her voice trembles, words coming out like screeches as she weeps, soft gasps of pain leaving her mouth as she speaks, having to pause and gather her bearings with each word spoken, lest she forgets to speak and let wordless weep talk for herself

“All I achieved was the position of a leader, put away from any sort of meaningful friendship I could make. No one sees me as me, no one sees Ikari, just the Hakumo leader. My true family.. the one I made alongside the fox… I can barely see, bound to the position of the leader here in Konoha, a prisoner of my duty…”

The dam breaks, and as tears start to fall without her control, gasps and sobs come out as well. “I’m a person too. I bleed red, not gold… I am not the answer to problems… I’m not the source of all their hatred towards the Hakumo… I’m just a girl… I shouldn’t… I shouldn’t…. I shouldn’t….”

Any semblance of rationality, of the controlled and withdrawn Hakumo leader vanishes, leaving just a girl, crying, trying to rationalize her life and every choice she made in vain. You jump on the floor, guiding your small paws towards her, jumping on her lap as she cries.

#You:
Her loyal companion, her loyal fox friend. The one who is always with her, on the good, the bad… and the worst. The one who scouted her the first time. You slide your furred body against her tummy, trying to cheer her up.

Sometimes you question, was it worth it? Was it fair to take a child out of the red light districts, where she could grow, not an easy life, but could grow happier than she is right now? Was it hard to train her to become a sage?

Was it any fair to a child like she was? Was it any different from brainwashing an impressionable child? You don’t know… as there is no way to know, you can’t change the past. The best you can do, is to stay with her, and hope her heart may one day heal, and hope this burden will one day lighten.
