#Attack of Titans

Kaylee heard the clap. It was loud enough to shatter the panes of glass in the windows of the building she was standing upon, not to mention the mirror she was holding!

*That’s seven years of bad luck!*

She thought to herself. But the strength needed to create such a shockwave with just a clap, that was far more interesting.
She flew off of the building. She knew that the “pros” wouldn’t want students to be involved in this, but she couldn’t help herself, something inside her demanded that she faced this strength. She saw a woman, standing as tall as Kaylee, with dark skin and a dark stare. Kaylee had never seen another female her height before, let alone one that also had such strength. If it weren’t for the fact that they looked nothing like each other, she might have wondered if she had found a long lost relative. As it was, she saw the woman towering over the pair of heroes. She should have felt concern for them, worry even, but all she could think was how much she had to fight!
With a burst of speed, Kaylee accelerated directly at her target, slamming into her with enough force to shake the building even before they smashed through the wall! The woman Kaylee was carrying didn’t seem phased at all by the brickwork, and with the element of surprise now worn out, she was fighting back. A knee slammed into Kaylee’s stomach, hitting her harder than anything she could remember. Kaylee felt the wind knocked out of her for the first time in her life.
“urgh!”
Sensing the weakness, Maddox reached down, grabbed hold of her sudden aggressor, and threw her backwards in a massive suplex. The mass of the green-haired giantess combined with the force of Maddox’s counter was too much for the poor floor to handle, and with a crash, the pair fell through to next floor.
A blast of green energy exploded out of Kaylee as she punched Maddox to get out of the Mad Ox’s hold. 
*Stronger than I thought you were.*
Maddox thought, as she released her grip and bounced back to get some distance. 
She was a child. A giantess, true, but in was obvious with a glance that this girl was not even of age yet. Youth had not left her, and judging by her tackling of one of The Five, she either had no real experience or had no fear of death. Either way, Maddox intended to introduce her to a real battle.

“That was a good ambush. More experienced soldiers than you have failed to get the jump on me. But that’s over now. Now you’re going to have to put up or –”

Before Maddox could finish her sentence, Kaylee charged her again. But this wasn’t a surprise attack, Maddox had more than enough time to react. She sidestepped, shuffled forwards, and landed an uppercut straight to Kaylee’s jaw. She was surprised though, when she saw that instead of being knocked out like she should be, Kaylee just looked at her and smiled. She threw her own punch, body emanating with Ki, right into Maddox’s chest. The dark-skinned woman was sent flying backward again, the second time in the same minute, crashing into the wall, through it, onto the floor of the behind apartment. Before she could get her new bearings, a giant fist slammed down on her abdomen. Kaylee had launched herself forward, then downward, using all that momentum to strike Maddox right in the gut.
Looking up, she saw the child above her, a cocky grin on her face.

“Is that it?”

Those three words stabbed into Maddox. She had been dealing with some hefty emotions after hearing about Desolator’s planned retirement; her teammates weren’t ready to lose the boss, she wasn’t ready. He had talked about how a child had broken his finger, and now here she was, with a child standing over her claiming victory. NOT how she wished to emulate the legend. Well fuck that!

Maddox glared at Kaylee, absolutely livid, and spat at her.

“Now you’ve done it, you little bitch!”
“No-one’s called me little before!”

Maddox snarled, her eyes flashed, and Kaylee grabbed her head in pain. What was this?
As the student stumbled backward, Maddox got to her feet.

“Oh, headache? Well, it’s about to get WORSE!” Maddox reared back and slammed a full power haymaker onto Kaylee’s temple, sending her reeling.

Kaylee was disoriented; what was happening to her? Her head felt like it was about to split open, even before the blow. She summoned her Ki, but it was harder than it should be, weaker than it should be. Still, she launched it at the criminal, but it was Maddox’s turn to bull charge. Her arms crossed in front of her, she ran through the blast, shoulder checking Kaylee with enough force for another shock-wave to rip through the building. Maddox grabbed her foe’s reeling head and delivered a headbutt to lay her out.
Kaylee hardly noticed it. Something was wrong, beyond the blows, beyond the pain she was feeling for the first time. 
“What – What’s going on?”
“Oh, you noticed? What’s the matter, feeling a little weaker? Enjoy having your quirk nullified!” 
Kaylee felt herself being lifted to her feet. She saw a fist, glove having burnt off from her Ki, filling her vision, before everything went black.

She was in a void. Nothing was around her but pinpricks of light, as though she were in space. She looked all around, trying to find a frame of reference, find anything. A lone light, different from the stars around, was shooting through this void. Bright energy flowed around it, propelling it. Kaylee reached out to it, and like a flash, she was in front of it. It was a sphere, white, with what appeared to be a door. She floated around to the front of it. There was a purple dome on it, acting like a window. Looking through, she saw a… baby?

*Is that…me?!*

She reached out and touched the sphere. As she did, everything went white once more. 

Maddox was confused. She was nullifying this girl’s quirk, at least in part, so she should be weaker, right? Then why, when she had weakened her and decked her straight in the face, was this girl still standing? Her eyes had rolled back in her head, but she was still standing. She began to shake, almost convulse. 
*Did I give her brain damage?*
Kaylee, meanwhile, was off on another trip…

She was by the coast. She could see the sea, but the focus was on the nearby field. That infant, though she looked more like a toddler out of the pod, was battling a group. Their voices were indistinct, sounding like a foreign language. Kaylee couldn’t make out what they were saying. She – her younger version – was fighting what appeared to be a group of heroes, or perhaps vigilantes, and was utterly destroying them. From what Kaylee could sense in this bizarre dreamscape, those attacks were far beyond what she could do even now! What was this?
There was only one left, and by the looks of him, he wasn’t long for the world. The toddler Kaylee floated in front of him, Ki attack in hand, ready to kill him. But with what must have been the last of his strength, he shot his hand out and shouted…something. Whatever he said was lost, as the vision began to collapse. She felt a burning around her head, the weight of shackles all over her body, the sensation that her other self was feeling. Both screamed. Kaylee could feel her power – that former power the infant version of herself used – being buried, locked away, hidden from her. The last vestiges of the vision collapsed, Kaylee began to fall into an infinite blackness, the last thing she saw being a colossal set of doors slamming shut.

Maddox had not been idly standing by as Kaylee went on her little introspection. She had been pummelling the girl – punching and kicking her as hard as she could – with minute apparent effect. It had been almost thirty seconds since she had used her Weakening Gaze, and what seemed the second after it wore off, the other giantess seemed to come to her senses.

“Wh-what?”

Maddox didn’t let any more words leave her mouth; it was her turn to be the interrupter! She swung a full power roundhouse kick straight to the side of Kaylee’s head, finally knocking her out as she crumpled to the ground.
“Well, that was a weird fight!” Maddox panted out. She was pretty badly beaten herself. Even the few hits this strange girl had landed on her hurt like hell. Hopefully there weren’t any more powerhouses upstairs. 
Maddox slinged her fallen foe over her shoulder, before leaping back through the holes the two had made. She needed to get back to her team!
