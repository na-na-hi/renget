>It's egg laying season
>Finana's stomach is bulging, but she refuses to admit anything is different
>you grow tired of her excuses, and carry her into a special room
>you tie Finana up, suspended over a shallow pool of water
>she pouts, but doesn't refuse you as you draw closer
>gently massage her stomach, plant little kisses all over her, fondle her while saying encouraging phrases into her ear
>she's trying to resist, but she grows more and more pliant
>eventually she lets out a little gasp and you catch a lovely egg as it plops out of her
>you lower it gently into the pool
>the gates have been opened, and six more eggs are lowered into the pool
>Finana is red-faced and panting, her eyes unfocused
>you spin her so she can fully see the pool
>you unzip your pants and unleash the beast
>as Finana comes back to herself she sees you furiously beating your meat over the pool
>you start nearing your edge and angle yourself to a better position
>Finana is staring intently, eyes darting back and forth wildly between you and the pool
>you feel surge forward and you fall to your knees as you carefully aim
>you and Finana watch as it settles over the eggs
>after it all floats down, you gently untie Finana 
>you both spoon by the pool, falling asleep watching over your eggs
