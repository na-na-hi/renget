!!!Note General Info
     Surrounding the titular "Clover Guild", made up of /pmdg/ anons isekaied to a PMD world and their native partners.
     Established by Guildmaster Meowstic, who has incredible psychic powers that can hunt down humons due to differences in aura.
     Guild is generally established in a forest near a lake on the Grass Continent in Capim Town. Guild building is inside a tree. There's a map of it!
	 Everyone has pillows and blankets (that aren't made of hay) standard-issue thanks to the efforts of Chespin and Wooper. Due to being made from leaves, they're dark green in coloration.
