!!!Note General Info
     Surrounding the titular "Clover Guild", made up of /pmdg/ anons isekaied to a PMD world and their native partners.
     Established by Guildmaster Meowstic, who has incredible psychic powers that can hunt down humons due to differences in aura (probably?).
     Guild is generally established "in a forest near a lake", on the Grass Continent in Capim Town. Guild building is inside a tree. There's a map of it! This info blurb is woefully outdated!
	Everyone has pillows and blankets (that aren't made of hay) standard-issue thanks to the efforts of Chespin and Wooper. Due to being made from leaves, they're dark green in coloration.
