!!!Note General Info
     Surrounding the titular "Clover Guild", made up of /pmdg/ anons isekaied to a PMD world and their native partners.
     Established by Guildmaster Meowstic, who has incredible psychic powers that can hunt down humons due to differences in aura (probably?).
     Guild is generally established "in a forest near a lake", on the Grass Continent in Capim Town. Guild building is inside a tree. There's a map of it! This info blurb is woefully outdated!
	Everyone has pillows and blankets (that aren't made of hay) standard-issue thanks to the efforts of Chespin and Wooper. Due to being made from leaves, they're dark green in coloration.

Notes/List to do
-Sort out the character list; inactive members go to bottom and active members go to top. Possible purge on members that only made one or two posts? (need discussion, maybe). In that note, also include personality blurb for sorting. Inactivve goes to a different table
-Remake the General Info (and maybe put it at the top of character list?)
-If the one responsible has time, conduct a survey on Guild affinity chart, Story timeline, and Minor characters (notable at least) that appears on the stories to everyone (in thread) and update based on the results and do it periodically maybe once a month or every 2 months?  (PS. Is the Aura Bow Personalities necessary to be put there?)
-Possibly remake the whole writing section table as some fields are more used than others. 
-Maybe put the writing section in a different page and make it multiple pages; i.e, page 1: Pre gathering to Pre Enter the Federation, page 2: Post Enter the Federation to next collab writing (?)
-This is optional and only if the authors are cool about it, would it possible to combine the **completed** multi-part stories into one entry in order to reduce cluttering. i.e The Teams Team Up pt.1, pt. 2, pt. 3 to The Teams Team Up (all combined in one rentry). Then again, it's a bit of a gray area since there's also sequels which are not the same thing and... (requires discussion).
-Lore Quick Reference needs some update.
-Rentry page archive needs update.
