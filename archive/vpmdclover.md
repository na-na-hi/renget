### Where to Start
!!!info What is the Clover Guild?
	The Clover Guild is a collaborative fiction project based on the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon franchise. Originating from 4chan’s /pmdg/ threads, the guild members make characters, write stories, draw artwork, and discuss the series. The eponymous Clover Guild is based in Capim Town on the Grass Continent, and its members include many humans-turned-Pokemon alongside native Pokemon.
	
	For more information, see the [Intro to the Clover Guild](https://rentry.org/cloverintro).
