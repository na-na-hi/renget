Comment: “Desc: After years of searching you've finally found it. Dr. Vatnik's Transformation Raygun. This 'toy' is said to be capable of transforming anyone into any animal, be it feral, anthropomorphic, or humanoid. It was banned before it could be hit store shelves and all copies of it were destroyed. All, except this one. It's fairly straightforward to use: Select an animal, a type (feral, anthro, or humanoid), and shoot. You have the power to change the world in your fingertips, what will you do?”
