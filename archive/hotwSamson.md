>Personal information
Samson was born terribly disfigured. His horrified bunker-babies parents decided to hide their shame by getting rid of him. They felt so little care for him, that they didn't even bother to stain their hands and put him out of misery, instead just dumped him on the edge of the Mutant Jungle and called it a day.
Whether it was lucky for him or not, Samson survived. Found by a mutated she-wolf, who nursed and sheltered him, he grew fast, but not fast enough to achieve full adulthood before the she-wolf died and he was left alone again. His physical mutations were a great boon, but with limited skills he still struggled greatly to survive each day.
One day he found a nest of muta-crabs with four yet unborn eggs. He took them with himself as pets in some primal need to quench his loneliness. Muta-crabs are a symbiotic species that use their miniscule psychic powers to read the needs of their host and try to grow into the form most useful to him to increase their chance of survival. Sensing that what Samson needs the most is something to protect himself with, the four grew their chitin exoskeletons into forms of large machetes with venom dripping down their blades.
That was a match made in heaven. With the weapons as natural to him as extensions of his arms, he became one of the jungle's apex predators, able to hunt even the biggest monsters.
There was however, one hunt that didn't go according to plan. He was following a trail of a human caravan he planned to feast on, but someone got to it first. The Nymphs. The sight of them awoke in Samson something he didn't know existed. He was awestruck as he watched them lure the humans away from the others one by one and butchered them. He could practically taste the blood dripping down their bodies.
However, not everything went according to the Nymphs plans that time. After a couple of their compatriots went missing, the rest of the caravan got more cautious and managed to discover the beautiful mutants. A fight ensued. It was a very close one, and the question whether the blonde maidens will come out of it victorious was not an easy one.
That was until a mass of muscles and sharp chitin fell out of the sky and started shredding humans, heavily tipping the scales of the battle. When the dust fell, only the mutants were left standing. The Nymphs were unsure whether they could or even really want to fight the newcomer, so they just grabbed some human carcasses for a late-night-snack and backed off. And Samson followed.
The Nymphs were preparing for an ambush, but were surprised to find that they found in him something more akin to a pet. He brought them gifts from his hunts, and every time they were in danger, he showed up to support them. Just ignoring him as he followed them around was getting a bit awkward, so eventually they started talking to him. Initially, Samson didn't understand a word they were saying, but was eager to learn, and they didn't mind teaching.
In time he became a sort of part of their group. While they prefer a more subtle methods, having a backup in the ball of whirling blades desperate for their approval and ready to turn anyone they point him at into a splatter of gore didn't sound like such a bad option, even if the way he stares at them can make them feel uncomfortable.
