>Exotic Spirit Root: Separation

In his past life Fēn Jiàngé, a formidable cultivator, delved deep into the esoteric mysteries of the Tao of separation and severance. Through years of relentless training and dedication, he honed his skills to perfection in two of the foundational realms of cultivation: Body Tempering and Qi Gathering. He possessed a prowess that was the envy of many, commanding respect and admiration from peers and rivals alike.

However, his insatiable thirst for knowledge and ambition made him grow more and more reckless. In his pursuit of a Soul Refining technique, tragedy struck. In an unforeseen mishap, he inadvertently severed the sacred connection between his soul and body. The once-mighty cultivator met his untimely demise.

Yet, Fate had other plans for Fēn Jiàngé. His soul, marked by the scar of separation, was granted a second chance. In an astounding twist, he was reborn into the world, a wealthy and privileged heir to a prominent family. Although the material riches seemed abundant, Fēn Jiàngé couldn't ignore the profound sense of an unbreakable tether drawing him towards something unknown.

Yearning for answers, he made a daring choice—to abandon his life of luxury and become a cultivator again. With the wisdom from his past life, his journey was exceptionally fast. Along this path, he discovered the purpose behind his return from the brink of death.

A significant part of his severed soul had found refuge within an ornate fan, an artifact that had been buried alongside his previous body. Fēn Jiàngé embarked on a daring mission to reclaim the fan and unlock the hidden potential it held within. The fan had merged with his soul, giving birth to a marvelous and exceptionally powerful treasure.

>Personality
He presents himself as arrogant, cocky, and insolent, often refusing to acknowledge those of lower cultivation grades as true cultivators and preferring to label them as mere mortals. Fēn Jiàngé rarely misses an opportunity to flaunt his prowess, wealth or talent and his words are often laced with subtle, or not-so-subtle, sarcasm and mockery.

Beneath this facade of arrogance and bravado he possesses a softer, more compassionate side. He is not entirely void of empathy or kindness. It's just that he has grown accustomed to wearing the mask of arrogance as a defense mechanism, a way to protect himself from the vulnerabilities of the world. His reincarnation has left him with an unquenchable curiosity and a sense of longing for the unknown, even as an Ancestor.

#Techniques

>Footwork
**Severing Flash Step**
His footwork leaves no trace, and he can effortlessly traverse any terrain with swift and silent movements. The essence of this technique lies in the art of division. Fēn Jiàngé can displace himself within moments by cutting the distance and space between him and the desired location.

>Barrage
**Single Strike Assault**
Fēn Jiàngé's mastery allows him to divide his strikes, turning a single attack into many. When he deploys this technique, it appears as if his every strike and motion is duplicated, creating a multitude of attacks that converge on the target. It is not limited to a single direction; it can envelop opponents from all sides, making it incredibly challenging to defend against. Fēn Jiàngé's mastery enables him to control the extent of division, making it suitable for both overwhelming a single adversary or engaging multiple opponents. However, the strength of the strikes are also divided, resulting in less individual force.

>Attack
**Cleave**
A technique that disrupts the cohesion of the target's body, rendering them vulnerable to damage. It is incorporated to a normal attack, with a delay between the disrupting effect and the actual strike. The delay is so small it is almost impossible to notice. 

>Barrier
**Partitioned Sanctuary**
The "Partitioned Sanctuary" is Fēn Jiàngé's defensive masterpiece. This barrier technique creates a protective partition, severing the space it encloses from the outside world. Once deployed, it forms an impenetrable barrier that shields Fēn Jiàngé and any allies within its confines. The partition can expand or contract at his will, adjusting to the demands of the battle. 

>Endurance
**Bastion of Dissolution**
This technique endows him with the ability to disperse incoming force, making his body appear almost impervious to harm. While part of the damage will be discarded, most of it will come back to him once he truns off this technique. Though with preparation he can make it so it returns gradually.
This technique also allows him to sever the connection between physical injuries and the pain they cause, granting him an extraordinary resistance to damage. 

>Body Tempering
**Bladeless**
Inspired by the core concept of swords - to sever and divide - Fēn Jiàngé used Body Tempering techniques that revolved around the usage of sabers as a base. Many of those techniques seek to make the user become one with their weapon, but Fēn Jiàngé had a different objective. Cutting the need for weapons from the body, separating it and thus making the user themselves a weapon, making it so that every movement is a potential strike, every limb an instrument of division.

At its core, the technique starts by creating an invisible aura around the body.  The practitioner learns to harness this aura, allowing it to permeate various parts of his body. His fingers become as sharp as the finest blades, his limbs acquire the cutting edge of a master swordsman's weapon, and his skin toughens to the hardness of tempered steel.

>Qi Gathering
**Heaven Carving Qi**
The technique's practice revolves around the practitioner continually separating their Qi from any impurities or obstacles and then merging it again, repeating this process until no impurities or obstacles remain. Through this meticulous process, the practitioner refines their Qi, much like a blacksmith tempering a blade, removing impurities and flaws with each iteration. The resulting purified Qi can be imbued by the practitioner's Spirit Root to incredible levels. In Fēn's case, even his breathing could cut something if he isn't careful. Because of how much they practice it, it also allows the user to gather and refine Qi at ridiculous speeds.

>Trump Card
**(still to be named)**
Fēn Jiàngé's ultimate trump card. It is a devastating attack that symbolizes the pinnacle of his cultivation. The technique's execution requires the practitioner to focus and enter a profound meditative state poised to strike with unparalleled power, making it risky to use in combat. In the moments leading up to the attack, the tension reaches a point where everything around Fēn starts to receive small cuts. , the strike itself is nothing remarkable. Barely noticeable even, at least by cultivator standards. The resulting effect, though, is something to behold. The attack unleashed, however, is of an incredible scale,  and it severs not only the body but also the soul.

The unique aspect of this technique is its ability to alter the very nature of what it severs. It separates the state of being whole form the target struck, the severed parts of a target turn into the default state of existence. This means that the separated portions become the new standard, making recovering form the cut inflicted incredibly hard.

However, the technique comes with a heavy price. Utilizing it leaves Fēn Jiàngé in a vulnerable position, and after using it he'sweakened, as if he has expended a part of his own essence to execute the technique. The toll is felt not only in his physical body but also in his already damaged spirit, as wielding such a power carries a heavy burden.
