I was never the biggest Sonic fan, I've only played the first few classic games and wasn't interested in playing anything after that. I vastly preferred pixelated games over stuff in 3d, so I was content with just that for a while.

Eventually though, I wanted to play more games like it, so I turned to fan games. Most of the ones I encountered were simply low quality, while others were just boring. 

It took quite a bit of digging, but eventually I found one that looked good, complete with sprites!

It was called 'Adventurous little lamb', it looked kinda barren from the few visible screenshots on the site. 
The backgrounds were colorful and bright, and the playable character resembled a Sonic character, albeit one you'd see in the background, with a basic design. There was an odd lack of enemies or bosses, but I didn't dwell on it much.

 The summary for it was thin too. 'Join Gaia on a mission to obtain her friend!'
Gaia must be the lamb character, simple enough. That wording is pretty odd though. Obtain? Maybe they just used the wrong word. It looked a little odd, but hey, it can't be worse than what I've already played!
 Guess I'd better start it and find out, hopefully it'll be memorable, or at least somewhat fun.
