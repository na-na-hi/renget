> These chatbots allow you to accomplish various things, from interacting in a CYOA / text adventure style environment, to visual novel style interactions. As well, many chatbots exist to allow you to talk to various NPCs from many games for longer than their dialogue tree would typically allow.

***

#####A few examples

- [x] As noted on the respective bot pages, complex scenarios require the most intelligent large language models capable of following instructions. You can find more info here https://rentry.org/aicg_meta and use https://openrouter.ai to try out different models. 

######CYOA
- [ ] A generic CYOA prompt addon can be used with almost any scenario or character [can't find any to be linked here]()
- [ ] Some cards have it integrated by design: [RP Taimanin Asagi and Sakura](https://www.characterhub.org/characters/saturnia/rp-taimanin-asagi-and-sakura-9a7e4d74)
- [ ] ~~Agnai adventure mode~~ appears broken

######VNs
- [ ] There's a dedicated frontend for the VN-like experience: https://miku.gg [![https://miku.gg](https://files.catbox.moe/c2ezt0.png)](https://docs.miku.gg/assets/overview.png)
- [ ] Or it can be achieved with special prompting, and enhanced with some coding: [(NSFW) Tomoyo card](https://rentry.org/tomoyocard) [![(NSFW) Tomoyo card](https://files.catbox.moe/oc6n30.jpg)](https://arch-img.b4k.co/vg/1710106280350.png)

######Text adventures
- [ ] You can create open-ended sandbox games with a set of instructions, like [Dungeon Core Simulator](https://www.characterhub.org/characters/styxcity/dungeon-core-simulator-d8ba890f) [![Dungeon Core Simulator](https://files.catbox.moe/txo3y6.png)](https://arch-img.b4k.co/vg/1709929748383.png)
- [ ] Or you can provide a more guided, story-driven experience with a small "database" of background info, like [The Rite of Belwick](https://www.characterhub.org/characters/asterisms/the-rite-of-belwick-f402d86c/) [![The Rite of Belwick](https://files.catbox.moe/anb643.png)](https://knickknack.neocities.org/chats.html?name=belwick)

######NPCs
- [ ] The best models even know obscure characters like [Mario](https://c.ai/c/zQjOee8sdK0SM3lYE9QMFY5A0KxOrbObyWhQGQYLNhk)  [![Super Mario](https://files.catbox.moe/zq2imd.png)](https://desu-usergeneratedcontent.xyz/g/image/1673/90/1673900300318.png)
- [ ] You can recreate any character from any game in text form

######Creamsan
This anon's scripted creations are too advanced for me, but maybe not for (You).
