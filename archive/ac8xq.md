#Why is there so much Paperwork?

The sun rose over Konoha. The village stirred to life as its citizens went about their day. In the center of the city, already hard at work, sat the village’s leader. The third Hokage, Inatsu Hikuhei.

Inatsu stamped ‘approved’ on a routine patrol request. He grabbed the next form. It was a requisition form. Taiki’s team was requesting radio headsets for a routine mi--

Inatsu did a double take. Taiki’s team?! WHAT KINDOF MORON GAVE THAT IMBECILE A TEAM?! Inatsu dropped the form. He held his head in his hands. He had. He’d given Taiki a team. He’d done it because, even though, Taiki was literally the last name on the list to get a team. Inatsu had reached the end of the list. He was completely out of ninja he trusted were capable enough to protect the next generation. As dumb as the muscle head was, he was probably the best pure fighter in the village. Maybe even counting Inatsu. 

Oh God… would the idiotic village elders make Taiki Hokage? All they cared about was strength! Could the man even read?!

Inatsu sighed. He put the nightmare of Taiki being the fourth Hokage out of his mind. He could only hope he'd have more say in his successor than that. He signed the requisition form, there was nothing for it. It was a reasonable request. Maybe he could assign a competent genin to actually lead the team? … Did he have competent genin? Issue for later.

Next form. Konna was requesting his team be sent an additional Chunin escort, preferably a medical ninja. Fine. Inatsu agreed with Konna’s instincts. There was something about this mission that had his hackles up. If another medical ninja made him feel better, so be it.

Next form. Meeting with Oscar, the gaijin. Approved. Inatsu didn’t mind listening to the barbarian prattle so long as it led to the man utilizing his expertise to better the village’s trade situation.

Next form. Ikari wanted to take her team on a mission. Fine. That they hadn’t been assigned another one yet was an oversight.

Next form…

The sun set as Inatsu Hikuhei finally finished the last of his labors. He leaned back in his chair. He frowned. When he’d first graduated from the academy with dreams of sitting in this chair and having his face put on a mountain, Inatsu had imagined more adventure and glory. He’d certainly imagined fewer paper cuts. 

Inatsu sighed, at least he was good at this. His predecessor had been a disastrous administrator. The man had been a great warrior to be sure, the best the village would probably ever see, but Inatsu had wanted to raise him from the dead so that HE’D have to live with the consequences of his administrative neglect. … but he’d learned how to resurrect the fool a little too late. Lucky bastard escaped into the netherworld. Inatsu didn’t care that the technique would require his death as payment. Death would be a small price to pay to satisfy his burgeoning grudge.
