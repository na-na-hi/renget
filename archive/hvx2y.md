Omori and his friends stood against Sweetheart. The princess of the castle used her flail to strike at Omori and his friends. The ground was hurt BAD. Sweetheart laughed at them. Taking a deep breath, Hero stood up. - He then summoned PEARL JAM and healed his party members. Furious - Omori them summoned HIS Stand - SILVER CHARIOT. Sweetheart took a step back as she saw the ghostly apperition floating behind the monochrome boy. Just then, Aubrey's eye twitched as she gripped the Baseball Bat in her palms. Behind the little girl, a massive figure formed. STAR PLATINUM. As Kel grabbed his Ball, a figure appeared in front of him. THE HAND. Sweetheart was now shaking as she backed up. Her eyes shown fear as her now gone smug smile fell into a frown. "S-STAY BACK!" She shrieked as she swung her weapon blindly at Omori's ghost... only for it to go right through. *SHINK* Sweetheart yelled out in pain as her arm was stabbed by SILVER CHARIOT - causing her to drop her flail. Sweetheart was backed into a wall, shaking like a lief in the wind. As the others' ghosts threw themselves at her, Sweetheart closed her eyes.
