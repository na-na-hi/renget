Illuminated by pale light.

Waited on by voracious desire.

Sunny hates this.

He hates this a lot, their stares, their cheers, their faces. Why are they looking at him like that? Why is he here? 

His mind is racing and a painful chilling ooze was slipping through his veins with their every cheer.

Trembling, he feels so small and yet he was the center of it all.

Everyone...familiar, strangers, all girls. Hollering him on, he doesn’t want to do it, he doesn’t want any of this.

…

She’s there. Mari.

Just sitting there.

Didn’t she bring him here? Wasn’t this her doing?

Why is she just sitting there? Smiling at him, like that?

A pleading look, can’t you see he doesn’t want this?

Laughter, nod. Nothing.

He’s not going to do this.

He shakes and shakes. 

Everything feels cold and hot at the same time, utterly unbearable.

Their cheers turn into shouts, impatient.

He’s not doing anything. He stares at Mari, a disappointed frown on her face.

Tears in his eyes, was he crying? He can’t stand this.

Mari was furious. Her gaze freezes and thaws him all at once.

He doesn’t do anything. Fists clench. His world falls into white. Don’t think about any of this.

Something shouts at him. Someone. Familiar. Family. Love.

Nothing but hunger in her gaze, nothing but want. Selfish. So selfish. I hate you.

The pounding noise in his ears grate harder. The lights are off nothing but his spotlight.

Boos, agitation. A command to take something off. Now.

Want and lust. The meal quivers and cries but no help comes. Nothing but purple and sickening black and white.

A shout. Stomping. One of Mari’s friends has gotten ever impatient. The cheering grows louder.

Run now.

He tries but something stronger grabs his arms and refuses to let go. He screams, his tears are streams now.

Take it off, take it off, he hears them yell and he wished he could stop it all.

The white in his mind grows fiercer. Pushed to the edge, a boundary he thought that can’t be reached.

Why isn’t Mari doing anything? Why is she letting this happen? Why does she want this to happen? Why? Why? Why?

Hands grip his shirt, he squirms and shakes as hard as he can.

In the bleakness of his mind, he hears something. Metallic shredding, a chorus, soft request to something horrible.

Nothing stops. His shirt is pulled off, young flesh exposed. Wild cheering.

The mad droning in his head grows louder. His shorts are pulled down, he’s just staring forward trying to make sense of just why everything is so purple now.

He hears it again, a request for violation? Is it?

Hands grope him.

They shouldn’t touch him. They don’t love him. Mari should be doing this. But she’s letting this happen. She wanted this to happen. Does she not love him anymore?

A dream collapses into utter purple. Squiggly squids and funny hands. Cats and hands he wants to kiss and pat.

Is he the only one?

The hands touch him all over, pulling down his last defense of his dignity.

…

It feels so good to be loved.

A moan. A quiver. His voice. His love. 

Her hand...the one touching him.

He holds it right back, surprising the girl when he forces her hand somewhere.

It feels so good. He feels so good to be loved. He’s receiving so much love and he feels so much more.

Laughter? Cheers? They were crowding up on him now, a singular tide of degeneracy.

No, love. This was love. And he feels it making him so much more stronger. A weight presses into his back, then heavier.

He takes so much love the girl touching him crumples over, unmoving.

Silence. A sudden still in the filthy merrymaking.

…

He moans, he feels purple.

He wants more.

And he will have more, isn’t this what they wanted…?

They won’t mind right…? Just a little bit more love...it feels so good for all of them right?

His hands find bodies. They flinch back, confusion and slight fear. Don’t be afraid.

They try to back away, just like he did. And just like they did, he pulls them back in with a force they cannot wrench away from.

Panic. 

Curious hands find warm soft mounds. She limps. She smells like a candy store.

Eager hands find toned comfy thighs. She limps. She smells like a perfume parlor.

Gentle hands find a pillowy firm rear. She limps. She smells like paints and art.

Hungry hands find a toned beautiful tummy. She limps. She smells like bread and home.

Wanton hands find everything and nothing escapes.

Some tried to run from him but they locked everything out just so they could have him all to themselves.

Why was he so scared in the beginning? 

He wasn’t hurting, this was a dream he never wanted to wake up from.

This was love and it feels so good, he feels so great.


Nothing moves except for the one left.

Sunny stares at his big sister with utter adoration.

The sound in his head was like an icepick, again and again he hears the chants, do it again and again and again, love me, love me, love me.

Sunny hears Mari say something, why was she crying? Isn’t this what she wanted?

He leaps for her, wrapping his arms lovingly around her neck and she tries to pry him off, screaming for him to stop.

She drops to the floor, weakened as something is taken from her.

As her consciousness fades away, she feels her dear little brother rip open her clothes with unnatural strength.

Panting. Wanting. Something goes inside her and everything in her screams.

Then, nothing. 

A horrible thing happens to the bodies.
