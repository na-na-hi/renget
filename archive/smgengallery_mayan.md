## ->Mayan Gallery<-

 -> *{Linguistically, make note that Mayan is / was a language that utilised Ejectives and Implosives - as in, the way you inhale/exhale with the syllable indicates a different meaning to the syllable - breathing a word inward can result in a completely different word than aggressively popping it outward. For an easy example, try to 'build up' the word 'Pop' for about a second, then release it - congratulations, you've just annunciated an Ejective P, which will sound notably different than the inhaled version of the same word. While unique characters exist for Ejectives / Implosives; Ejectives can be given like (P'), while Implosives are the opposite ('B)}* <-
 -> *{Also, mid-word stresses exist in this language to signal where you stress the next part of the word more than the last (dumbass = dumb¦ass). These are given either as ˈ or ¦ . I prefer ¦ in this context, so it's not confused with Ejectives/Implosives - after all, it's fucking stupid that you're supposed to be able to tell the (genuinely important) difference between ʼ & ˈ , which is also different from ' . While the details vary, this is usually why some names have spaces in them, while others are treated as one word but with harsh syllables in the middle. If I remember correctly, there's no reason or logic as to which names do / don't get this treatment - Kukulkan / Kukul Kan and Ixchel / Ix Chel would follow the same rule respectively, but we just do them differently because who cares}* <-

 -> *{Due to SMITE being a clusterfuck in terms of Mayan sects, pronunciations may also vary based on region the God was observed in - for accuracy's sake, I should say "it's not 100% accurate"; but also fuck that, nobody gives a shit, we're talking in colloquial terms (especially when we have examples of local natives still practicing the Mayan languages today, even if muddied with time)}* <-
