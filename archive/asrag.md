->"I'll never forgive the Japanese" Edition(1)<-
1: Social Media Presence
Q: Does your MHA have a social media presence?
A: Yeah, but she refuses to put any of it Japanese.
Q: Is it their real name, or their cape name, or do they have both?
A: Sallie keeps hers on the same account due to laziness.  She has a small but dedicated following of westaboos.
Q: What do they post? Who do they follow?
A: Videos of trick shots, rants about gun rights, gun safety tips for aspiring gun owners, and a weekly Q and A where she answers questions about the USA.
Q: Have you been a good hero today?
A: If by "good" you mean "has not gotten written up for a violation by police or school authorities", then yes!

2: How do you feel about your quirk?
Q: How do you feel about your quirk?
A: Views is it as a blessing from God with a capital G.
Q: Is this what elevates you above the rest of the bozos? Is it a curse you wish you never had? Is it just a tool you happen to own?
A: Its a tool for justice and peace in her eyes, even if the results aren't as pretty as cleaner-killing quirks.  Theres a special place in hell for anyone with mind or memory manipulation quirk in her mind.
Q: If you had the chance, would you trade your quirk in for another random one?
No, Sally wants to master her own deadly ability even if it earns her fear from those who don't understand the need for it.

3: Acts of Heroism / Favorite Pro Hero / Thoughts on Potential
Q: What deeds of 'heroism' have you done lately that you want Senpai to praise you for?
A: As much as she hates the honorifics, she does enjoy seeing the upperclassman marvel at her trick shots and her nerves of steel.
Q: Who is your favorite Pro Hero?
A: All American ones few in Japan have ever heard of.  She could go on for hours but knows few in her class or city care.
Q: Who do you think has the most potential, good or evil, among our up and comers?
A: Mirror Devil.  If theres someone Sally is worried will get put down after going rogue, or just losing his mind, its Chris.  No much she can do to help other than keep buying him gun safety books so he remembers not to make a .50 cal round fire it out of a .308 barrel.
Q: What's your favorite snack?
A: Chili-Cheese Fritos.  Has them sent from back home along with other American snacks.
Q: Do you jaywalk?
A: If theres no cars, why not?  She can't wrap her head around the kids who wait at every light for no reason.

4: Ultimate Moves / Gadgets / Willpower/ Night Parade
Q: Have you done anything to help others today?
A: She's great at scaring pushy guys away from women on trains.  Sometimes even without firing a blank in the train.
Q: What's your ultimate move called, what's it do? Have you used it before? Did it work or fail spectacularly?
A: "Seven Trumpets", a quick succession of rubber-tipped .50 cal rounds which requires a stationary target to land.  She's used it, but its not quite as non-lethal as she thinks it is.
Q: Do you plan to commission any tools or gadgets when you get the funds? If so who from?
A: Sally desperately wants permission to test out gloves with compensators and silencers built onto the palms, or heeled shoes with a similar effect.
Q: Do you have exceptional Willpower?
A: This isn't a particularly good thing in her case, since she has done minimal adaption to Japanese customs bescause of how staunch she is in the American way.
Q: What are your thoughts on the Night Parade?
A: (OOC: I have no idea what the night parade is, will answer this properly when I figure that out.)

5: Which of the Pro Hero PCs would your character most want to intern under (I'll even let you pick a teacher if you want since there's not many choices otherwise)? Which would you personally want your character to intern under?
A: If Sally is still stuck in Japan at that point, she'll just pick randomly.  If a piece of plastic is going to determine wheather or not shooting a criminal is murder or heroism, then she wants it done ASAP so she can do Gods work sooner.

6: What kind of hero do you want to become? When you save the day, what do you want the civvies to think? Do you want admiration? Reverence? Do you want them to get hyped up about your existence or do you want to be a calming presence?
A: Sally wants reverance from the public.  What matters is keeping people safe and sending criminals to their maker, not wheather or not she gets on cereal boxes.
Q: What kinda coffee do you like? Doinâ€™ some market research, gotta stay ahead of the competition.
A: Black with a little sugar.  She doesn't like to drink coffee but her dad had a way of making it that she can't quite replicate.

7: Residance 
Q: Let's talk residencies and bases of operation. What does yours look like? How is it decorated? For most folk this could be their actual house or apartment, but for the heroes who run their own agencies it could be their office building, or a villain's secret hideout, a supporter's workshop, etc. What's yours like right now?
What would you want it to be like? 
A: Sally has a tiny apartment that her parents pay for close to school where she keeps books, computers, food, and other nescities scatter about in organized chaose.  The one thing she does make sure to organize is her keepsakes from her parents, like some of the pretty bullet necklaces from her mom, her first bullseye on a paper target, and photos of her and her parents out together.  Its not a place she would ever take a boy she liked back to.

8: Hobbies
Q: You got hobbies outside of doing school/heroics/villainy/whatever? We can't be all business, all the time, right? What do you do for fun?
A: Her guilty pleasure is comp-stomping on FPS games, with liberal amounts of trashtalking.  Its not uncommon for saturday and sunday nights to go 3:00 AM just rising the ranks of whatever shooter she can find that she hasn't mastered.

9: Biggest Personality Flaw
Q: What do you think your biggest flaw is?
A: My impusliveness.  Its what got her here in the first place, and a clear sign from God that she needs to get a better judgment on the force she uses and where she uses it.
Q: Not in terms of strength, but in personality.
A: Her stubbornness makes her very hard to make friends with, especially when her situation has made her so prickly.
Q: Where do you fall short as a person?
A: A creeping thought in the back of Sallies head says she should never kill again, but she tries not to listen to that guilty part of herself.

10: Biggest Personality Strength
Q: We've learned your flaws and your fears. Now I wanna see some big egos. What's your greatest strength?
Personality-wise, that is. 
A: Sally was not raised to be a quitter, even when things seem bleak or dangerous.  Giving up is equivilent to a loss for her, and she abhors losing.  If she's bullied, it just tells her that God is testing her patience and control.

11: Hidden Talents
Q: What are your hidden talents? Things that people wouldn't expect you to be talented at, but you are. Maybe you're secretly a good singer, or a great chef? Could be anything.
A: Sally has an almost emberassingly cute voice when she sings, especially when she sings hymns.

12: Misc. Sports Festival Questions
What are you going to be up to during the Shiketsu sports festival? Will you be attending, and if so, for what reason?
Honestly, Sally was glad she was sick for the stupid thing.  She was fit enough, and to the Japanese shooting isn't a sport so theres no reason for her to go and let the boys see her in those skimpy bloomers they make the girls wear for PE.

13: Most Significant Person in Your Past
Q: Aside from family or friends, what person would you say has positively impacted your life the most? It could be your idol who you strive to follow, or it might be some random guy you never got the name of who gave you some sagely advice. Could be anything, really.
A: An old timer at her shooting range had Sally use her quirk to put down his livestock to teach her that shooting a gun was not a game, and what it looks like to watch something die.  She's still learning to control her quirks power so she doesn't leave a pile of bodies everywhere due to that discomfort with watching things die.

14: Prized Possession
Q: What would you say is your most prized possession? Is it a keepsake from your family? A gift from a first friend? A weapon that's carried you through all your dangerous situations?
A: Sallies most prized possession is he cross necklace her dad gave her.  Wheather or not its really blessed is up in the air, but that doesn't change its personal value to Sally.

15: Regrets
Q: It's natural to regret things in your life. Whether it's something big like never being able to make amends with a family member, or something tiny like selling a collector's item right before it skyrocketed in value, we've all got things we wish we could do better.
So a 2-for-1 today, friends. What is your biggest regret, and what's a really trivial one you still think about?
A: Her biggest regret is getting sent over, not controling her powers well enough to knock the three robbers out, to not have known the law well enough to know what do.  A more trivial one is her regret at being so quiet in class, as she's coming around to this whole "Japanese style school" thing, a little.
