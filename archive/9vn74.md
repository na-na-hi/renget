I put my coat on and take an umbrella outside with me, a light snow is falling over Tokyo. I wander the streets, searching for Kronii. It’s quiet, it’s really quiet. I didn’t know cities could be *this* quiet. I follow long empty streets, looking for the girl who changed my entire world. I know she’s out here…but just where did she wander off to. A department store? A restaurant? No…she said we were supposed to lay low. She wouldn’t wander into any places like that. 

I take a turn and start walking up a hill, the snow is starting to pile up on the ground now. I turn and gaze over at the city…the subtle tones of light from the houses and businesses reflecting off of the snow and into the sky…it’s gorgeous. It’s like the sun is still out and not out at the same time. So calm and quiet, this is the most peaceful world I’ve ever been in. Maybe I can…get a bit closer to the guardrail over on the edge of the road. The snow on the road is completely intact, not a single soul has been around for a while. I look up the road and notice someone standing in place, staring out at the city too. Ah! That’s gotta be her! I walk up the hill to meet them and sure enough, it’s Kronii. 

“Evening, Ms. Time Warden.” I call out

She remains still for a few moments before turning her head towards me. I look down to her feet, there aren’t any prints around her. Had she been standing here for a long time? 

“Hello, my little detective. Come here often? Ufufu~” She playfully laughs. 
I stare at her for a few moments, she looks like Kronii, sounds like Kronii, but is she really Kronii? All day it's been like this. I’m so not used to this behavior; I might go into shock! I clear my throat and smile at her, “Well, I got your message. I was wondering what it was about. Once in a lifetime or something like that?”

“Ichi-go ichi-e, that is correct. Do you know why I sent that to you?” She asks, her voice so calm and cool. I begin to hear my heart beat within my chest. She looks…perfect…She’s perfection, in the literal sense. Only in an abnormal situation would you ever get to see her like this, on a quiet and snowy night, when everybody else has already gone to sleep. I look at Kronii's kimono, it's so flawless...it's actually...The snow it’s…it’s not landing on her… its landing around her. That’s a nifty spell, can’t believe I’m out here using an umbrella like normie.

“Ame?” She calls out. I was so lost in her beauty I had completely forgotten about her question. 

“Ah…right…Uhm... why you sent that to me. I guess to... cherish every moment of my life?” I say halfheartedly, I can’t really think about something on that deep a level right after learning about it.

“Not a bad answer. I’ll give you credit for that. Good job.” She says in that butter like voice, just sliding into my ears and infecting my brain. Ah…what the heck…I’m completely smitten!

“Did you know Ame, that it actually rarely snows in Tokyo. Conditions in the atmosphere typically don’t allow it, but once in a while, things line up *just* right. The temperature has to remain low enough for the snow to reach the surface of the city AND that atmospheric pressure must be such that moist air is brought into the city from the south to cool the upper air in the sky above Tokyo. That lesson is free by the way.”

I stare at Kronii, finding myself rather speechless at the situation. I look at the city for a bit and think. What the actual hell is happening right now? “Uh…wow…that’s pretty wild Kronii. Did you learn that from Fauna, or maybe you secretly just love meteorology. Might have to look that info up myself!” I lightly tease. I’m impressed that she knew that. 

“Well like the saying goes, variety is the spice of life~” Kronii smiles at me and walks towards me, her shoes print deep into the freshly fallen snow. The crunch it makes echoes into the night sky, imprinting the scene into my memory as Kronii takes my right hand into her left. 

“Ame, if you could wish for one thing, what would it be?” 

“Anything I want?”

“Anything.”

I free my hand from Kronii, putting it on my chin and begin to think…anything I want…with a single wish? I haven’t really ever thought about that. A lot of money would be pretty nice but…I don’t really need money…A lot of yummy food? No… that would waste the wish! Hmm…Oh! I drop my hand and slam it down into the palm of my other hand. I know!

“If I could wish for any one thing, I would wish for a peaceful life. If I’m at peace, then I know that all the cases in the world have been solved and there’s no more reason for me to time travel. No more investigations. Just me kicking my feet back on a beach and sipping on some coconut juice.”

“Aha…that’s a pretty innocent wish to have. To wish for a peaceful life…not a peaceful world? Interesting…” Kronii trails off at the end. 

“Well you know, if I ask for a peaceful world, it throws things out of balance right? There needs to be equal amounts of good and bad. That’s what makes us, us right? But if I make my life peaceful, then as a byproduct, the world should be peaceful without affecting that balance!” I raise my chin high, proud of my prolific little idea.

“Ahahaha…well said Ame, I guess you have the idea correct…more or less. I’m actually for this wish, I like it. It wouldn’t exactly work like that, but perhaps one day you can find that peace. I’ll be cheering you on the whole way.” Kronii turns back towards the view of the city and smiles. “Now let’s go back home.”

“Why were you out here in the first place Kronii?” I ask her a question before we start the journey back.

“To experience this moment in time with you Amelia” She replies. She…I…ugh …<3

Kronii walks past me and heads over to the sidewalk and down the hill. I follow her with butterflies in my stomach. 

“Hey Ame…what would you say to joining Hololive?”

“That idol front company thing?” I reply, honestly having forgotten about it as we walk down the hill.

“Yeah. Might be a good fit for you.”

“What makes you think that?” 

“Well I’ve read online that they have talking foxes, magical squirrels, superhuman dogs, basically the works. Why don’t you check them out? They’d probably let you join, might even line you up in your own team of special characters.”

“A team? Of other special characters? But I’m not… very special Kronii…”

“You are to me Ame, and that’s the best recommendation anybody could get!”

My heart…damn…I think I’m…falling for her. No…I’ve already fallen…and hard. I pinch my cheek with my left hand to ensure I’ve been awake the whole time. Join up with Hololive huh…I guess it couldn’t hurt to offer my investigation services to them!
