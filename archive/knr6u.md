>We've been together for a long time now
>I feel like I could dance among the clouds
>Enjoy the feeling of being small and cute in comparison to my American boyfriend
>My American boyfriend... how wonderful that is to say
>I'd resigned myself to never finding anyone to love me
>Let alone someone so wonderful
>He makes me laugh every day
>Treats me so well
>I feel like the happiest girl in Japan
>Wait... I'm not a girl anymore
>I'm a woman
>Thanks to him
>But there's an elephant in the room
>Something I've tried to avoid thinking about
>He'll have to go back to America
>And that time is coming soon
>Now that I've experienced life with him, can I live without him?
>Would I even be a complete person without him?
>I've grown so much thanks to him
>Would I shrink back to my old self if he leaves?
>No, I shouldn't think like that
>I should enjoy whatever time I have with him
>There he is now
>He looks serious
>Is something wrong?
>What's he going to say?
>"The time we've been together has been the happiest time of my life," he says
>"You make me feel alive and whole in ways I didn't think I'd ever know."
>"And I know how much you love our relationship."
>"So would you be happier if you came back to America with me?"
>Holy...
>Can he do that?
>Take me with him?
>Would I really be happy in a foreign land?
>My spoken English still isn't the best.
>Still, if it means staying with him
>"I don't know..."
>His face falls
>"...And I never will unless I try."
>His face lights up
>So does mine
