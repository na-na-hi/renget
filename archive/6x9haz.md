"I know I've said that before, but thank you again for looking after my apartment while I was gone, Okayun!", Korone said as she finished the rest of her curry. Okayu nodded, half-paying attention to the conversation, most of her attention devoted to a mobile game — she was done with the meal way faster, after all. It wasn't really an issue for her and she appreciated the change in environment. Korone grabbed both of their plates and stood up. "I'll do the dishwashing too, as thanks!" 

"Sure, feel free." Okayu nodded, still not taking the focus of attention away from her phone screen. As she said that, she got traces of realization get to her, but it was already too late.

"Why is the whole sink full of dishes, Okayun?"

"You... uh... said you wanted to do dishwashing, I thought you didn't mind?"

"No, no, it's clearly not just today's dishes. Why are there so many? Why are all of them dirty? There aren't enough clean plates either, where are the rest of the plates?" 

"I just remembered that something came up, gotta go, thank you, bye!" 

"What is this? Did you just hide the dirty plates in the cupboard instead of washing them? Why would you do that? There's mold in here. Please come closer."

Okayu ran out of the kitchen. "As I said, bye, talk to you later!" 

"Actually we need to talk right now!" 

For whatever reason she didn't take a turn for the exit - might have been a good decision, turning the keys would have taken too long, she could be caught and... better not to think about that. Instead, she took to the left, into a dark bedroom, and hid safely under the sofa, where she'd wait until Korone calms down and lets her leave. She has her phone with her and enough battery to last her a couple hours at least.

She hid safely under the sofa.

Hid safely under the sofa.

She hid - come on - safely under! the! sofa!

No use. She managed to get under there right down to the waist line. Some parts of her body just couldn't fit any further. She tried a few more times to go further in, then tried to get out (which would be less optimal), and again, nothing, utterly stuck. The situation couldn't get any worse.

A light switch clicked, followed by a "So, what do we have here?"

No, of course it could.
Okayu, once again, desperately tried to crawl out from under the sofa - to no use — then changed her strategy and attempted to do a push-up, with the intent to raise the furniture just high enough to free herself. It didn't work at first, and then it didn't matter, because Korone plopped herself onto the sofa, right over where Okayu was trying to hide, and grabbed her viciously flailing tail with one hand, stroking it gently with the other. 

"Someone's being very sneaky in here, isn't she?" Korone inquired coyishly, tilting her head to the side. "Okayu-chan, who do you think this is?" She gently yanked her tail - not hard enough to cause any pain, but sending shivers down her spine nonetheless. 

"That's me, Korosan. I'm just taking a nap, please don't bother me."

"That so, Okayu-chan? Then where's the rest of you? Could you show your face to me? I just love your puffy, chubby cheeks and want to see them again." 

"Ah, you see, Korosan, I'm currently a bit stuck. Please help me get out."

"Oh, I'll give you one better, Okayu-chan. I'll help you not get stuck in the first place next time! First of all, why are you in this situation?"

"Because there's too little space under this thing, and I can't lift it. Plus you're sitting on it now too, Korosan."

"No, that's not it. Please don't blame my sofa for this, Okayun. How are you to blame?"

"Because I thought of a poor hiding place."

"That's not it! Think more."

"Because I'm a fat cat and my giant, lewd tits got me in trouble once again?"

"Closer, but wrong again."  Korone was absolutely elated. She loved to make Okayu say embarrassing things out loud, and deeply regretted she couldn't see her face getting beet red. "Come on, one last try. Why did you suddenly need to hide from me at all?"

"Because I'm a sneaky, lying, naughty, lewd little kitten who's disappointed you yet again, and I can't take responsibility for my actions."

"That's a lot better, Okayun! And should I be letting you out right now?" 

Okayu's "Yes?" was said with an intonation as hopeful as possible and her hopes were, of course, dashed immediately.

"No, of course not!" Korone giggled. "You're so dumb. Little dummy kitty. You should be taught a lesson first."

Okayu hated to prolong this even more. It was dark, hot, stuffy and dusty and she could hardly keep herself from sneezing. "But I have already learned my lesson, I even apologized! Let me out and I'll make it worth your while~"

"Mmm, that's an interesting offer, you lusty little kitty, but I'm going to entertain myself first. And you didn't even apologize, you just said some true things about yourself! Now, what to do, what to do..."

The sofa creaked as Korone leaned forward, let go of the tail and grabbed Okayu's buttocks, one with each hand, squeezing hard, almost digging her nails in hard enough to leave scratches right through the jeans, then let go, resting her hands where they were, absent-mindedly drumming a simple rhythm with the fingers of her right hand. "Do you like Donkey Kong, Okayu-chan?", she asked, seemingly apropos of nothing.

"Kind of, yeah. It's not my favorite Nintendo platformer, but I played a lot of it." Where was she going with this?

"Do you remember the one that's like a rhythm game? I think it was a Wii game. I wanted to play it." 

"Ohh, yeah, it's for the Gamecube actually. I never played it because it needs special drums and I don't have those."

"Me neither, but I saw a listing for the bongos on Ebay and I've been thinking about spending some money on a pair. It would make for a fun stream, too. But I want to check out how they'd feel before committing and I hoped you'd help."  How?

Korone leaned over further, stuck thumbs between the waistline of Okayu's jeans and her sweaty skin and pulled down — there was no need to unbutton something that couldn't be buttoned in the first place. Once the jeans were a third of the way down Okayu's considerably sized derriere and somewhat modest black panties were mostly visible, Korone grabbed the base of her tail and pulled it out of the jeans' tail hole, and then a quick shake was enough to let the jeans fall down, midway to to her plump thighs. Satisfied with the amount of skin now exposed to fresh air, Korone again put her hands down on each buttock per, in a resting position.

"Do you remember any DKC songs, Okayu-chan? I can put one on YouTube, and you're already serving an important function here, but I just like your voice so much..." 

"Of course, Korosan. Is the DK64 game over music okay?" 

"Of course, anything you pick would be nice."

Okayu started humming the first few notes of the track and, as she expected, almost simultaneously Koro raised her right hand, struck her right buttock, then raised it again, struck again, followed by a slap to the left, and so on. Korone was cupping her hands a little to reduce pain and make the slaps louder, but it still stung. Not as much as the indignity of having her butt played like it's a bongo drum, though!

It was a short track though, and she hummed it to the end, but by the end she was about done, mentally and physically.

"How did I do, Okayu-Chan? " , Korone asked in an innocent, cutest voice.
"You missed quite a few notes, actually. I think rhythm games just aren't your thing."
"Izzatso?" Korone slid off the bed, butting herself right near Okayu's legs. "I think I can learn, just need a little bit of practice. We should try a different song", she said, lifting Okayu's tail with one hand and rubbing her butt in a circular fashion with the other. "
"Which one?"
"Iunno. How does 'Naughty brat cat gets her naughty fat butt spanked bright red' sound?" 
"I'm sorry, Korosan, I don't really know this one."
"Really?" Korone's right hand rose up in the air and then back down, with a heavy, loud slap that sent her skin ringing. It left a bright red handprint, no doubt: Korone was fond of leaving those, as if to mark her property, but the suddenness of it and the coldness of Korone's voice combined to force a loud unholy yowl out of Okayu's lungs, "See? You already know the notes."

Then she got to work. There was no attempt to sweeten the pill to it: Korone was here to hurt her, and hurt her she would. She rhythmically and ruthlessly alternated between her buttocks, making them jiggle with every slap like a jar of jello emptied into a plate. The strikes individually didn't hurt as much as that first one, but that was not a nicety: Korone didn't want to tire herself out before she was done. The pain was piling up though, and Okayu generally kept to the strategy of keeping silent yet letting out quiet whines and sobs from time to time. She surmised it would please Korone more to feel like Okayu is putting on a brave face but her long-overdue punishment hurts so bad that she can't help but break the facade.

Not that it was that far from the truth either.

Koro had incredible stamina and worked like a typing machine. She got to Okayu's upper thighs, hesitated a little bit for whatever reason, then the thing Okayu has been lowkey dreading has happened and the correction became anew, from the top, slapping right on top of fresh bruises. The sharp stings proved almost too much, and it became increasingly difficult to contain her genuine noises. Unfortunately, Korone picked up on that, and on the third encore, when she got to that nice, almost picturesque handprint across Okayu's buttocks, she scratched it with her fingernail (making Okayu flinch and recoil a little), then grabbed her waist firmly under her left arm and left a slap directly on top of the handprint. Then another in quick succession. And another. And the next was one the last straw. Okayu broke down in actual tears.

"Why are you d-doing this to me? You're m-mean. I h-hate it. I h-hate you s-so much! Go away!" somehow rose up and through Okayu's throat like bile, and her heart skipped a beat, awaiting a retaliation. But none came, at least physically. Instead, Korone let go of her grip and instead gently put a finger on her lower back, trailing it down, hitching the panties a bit but not pulling them down, all the way down to... between her legs. Then she sniffed her finger intently.
"Really? You hate this so much? Then why are you dripping wet, you lying lazy bum?"
"That's sweat." Okayu replied in a very unconfident voice. 
"Sure it is." Korone pulled her panties down to the knees in one swoop, spread her legs a little and shoved her face in, sticking her tongue out and letting a drop of "sweat" descend onto it. It wasn't really sweat, it turned out. 

"Well, your crimes are piling up today, aren't they? Instead of taking your punishment like a good kitty and hating every second of it, you decided to get really horny now. What am I to do with you?"

Okayu let out an indecipherable noise in reply. 

"Guess I'll have to punish you in some other way, huh? Alright." Korone spread Okayu's legs a bit more to have a decent enough access to her nethers, then dove back into the wetness. Her tongue was a bit rough and scratchy, but she knew how to be tender nonetheless, playing with Okayu like she was dealing with buttons on a controller and not her wet, puffy pussy. Though she was moaning in pleasure, she didn't let herself get lost in the fog of ecstasy — it was in the back of her mind that Korone would stop right before an orgasm, on the very brink of it, as she was skilled in doing. 

The truth was actually worse, in a way. Korone just stopped abruptly, her face disappeared from between Okayu's legs, and her hand returned to playing a rhythm on Okayu's throbbing, bubbly bongo set. A dozen or so slaps accompanied by yelping and hissing, then it was back to another session of tender oral, and the cycle repeated with no pattern to it. Her spine becane a red hot poker of pain, and a snake of pleasure coiled around it so tightly that she could no longer tell where one ended and the other began. Perhaps that was the point.

As Korone reappeared back from between Okayu's legs, no further pain followed immediately. Not physically, anyway. Instead it seemed that there would be more scolding.

"Say, Okayu-chan, why did you do this anyway?"
"Because I'm a dumb lazy cat that needs to be punished?"
"No." Korone giggled. "I mean, yes, but. You're lazy but not lazy. You did this on purpose, you wanted to piss me off. Didn't you?" Long pause, no answer, another hard slap. "DIDN'T YOU?"
"I... I missed you so much. I thought about you constantly. I wanted attention. I wanted to... I wanted you to be mean to me. I'm... I'm sorry. Korone-chan, please."
"Please what?"
"Please..."
"PLEASE WHAT?"
"Please let me come. I want you to... make me come... so badly." 
"Huh. I'm actually getting a bit tired. Let's see what we can do about that."

Korone grabbed Okayu's foot and yanked off her slipper, then tickled her sole. Okayu giggled out loud, squirmed in her position, thrashed a little, but Korone was holding her leg with one hand pretty tightly as she tickled with the other. That was a fourth, unrelated form of torture that she would have to endure today, in addition to the pain, the humiliation and the denial, it seemed. It was like an all-you-can-eat buffet, and Okayu liked to eat. 

An eternity later, Korone let go of Okayu's foot, and then something cold and inanimate touched her butt. The sole of the slipper. 
A minor side effect of Okayu spending an alarming amount of time sitting on Korone's face was that her girlfriend knew every square millimeter of her butt (and there were a lot of them) up close, every nook and cranny, and knew exactly what parts of it touched the chair (or her girlfriend's face) first. And those are exactly where the sole was touching. It was a message, a deliberate one: "You will think of this moment every time you sit down for a while." Okayu heard it.

"You said you wanted me to be mean, huh? You said you wanted me to make you come? Well, let's find out how much of a little masochist you are. If you will come from pain alone, good. If you won't, that's fine by me too. I forbid you from masturbating to completion today, by the way. Is that clear?"
"Yes, Korosan."
"Now apologize."
"I'm sorry for not washing the dishes and lying to you, Korosan."
"Now beg."
"Please give me a good thrashing, as long and hard as you would like. Please, Korosan, I beg of you, I need it so badly."
"Good. Let's go!" Korone yanked Okayu's tail up with one hand again, and the slipper rose up in the air. Okayu's heart fluttered: what if she was actually not that much of a masochist? What if it's all for naught? But her worries were unwarranted: only about five times after the slipper came down on her soft flesh, sending waves white hot pain through her body, the snake has finally swallowed her whole. 

There was no pain in her screaming at this point - it was pure pleasure. Spurts of sticky liquid gushed from her as she convulsed on the ground, as Korone gently rubbed her throbbing butt and kindly whispered that it will be alright. After she calmed down a bit, Korone stood up, raised the sofa a little, dragged Okayu's semiconscious body from it, then sat down and put her girlfriend over her knee, ass up. There was no threat of further punishment today, only hugging, headpatting and gentle stroking. Okayu drooled, lying down on a cloud of joy. She was a good cat now. She will be a good cat forever. 

Surely.

----

Half an hour later, after a mutual bath (and maybe a little bit of kissing or something in that general area), Okayu was lying down on her stomach, holding a hairdryer with one hand and checking her phone with the other. 

"Huh, twenty minutes. Yeah, I think I'll make it.", she said out loud.
"Where?" Korone's head popped into the bedroom.
"Till the next train home, duh."
"Oh? I think you'll be missing it. I'll keep you busy for some time now."
"What's gotten into you?" Okayu said in a very smug voice. "Did you miss me that much too?"
"Not as much as I missed the CLEAN FUCKING DISHES! GET YOUR ASS IN THE KITCHEN THIS FUCKING INSTANT OR IT'LL GET TO MEET A FUCKING RUBBER SPATULA!" 

Anyway, that is how the Schroedinger's cat paradox is resolved: it turns out that sufficiently good cats can teleport.
