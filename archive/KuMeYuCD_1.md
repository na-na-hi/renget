A strong wind knows a sturdy weed.
 
Meb: The Sentinels were already on their fifth mission.
 
Suz: Gyaaah! The Stardust are here! Save me, Mebu!
 
Meb: Calm down, Suzume. Stop clinging! Gunner squad, take aim! 
 
Sentinels: Roger! 
 
Meb: Fire!
 
Shi: We hit.
 
Yum: The Stardust are little more than targets for my elegant marksmanship!
 
Meb: Shizuku, Miroku-san! Don't let your guard down! The next wave is coming!
 
Suz: Don't come! Shield! I'm deploying my shield!
 
Meb: Thanks, Suzume! You blocked that attack well!
 
Suz: I'm going to die! I'm so going to die! Mebu! Take these things down already!
 
Meb: Gunner squad, take aim! Fire!
 
Suz: Aaah! There's more! This time I'm definitely gonna die!
 
Yum: For how much she screams about dying, she blocks the oncoming Stardust attacks better than anyone else in the protector squad.
 
Meb: Suzume's instincts concerning survival are better than anyone else's. And I fully trust her on that matter.
 
Suz: Gyaaah! Gaaah!
 
Suz: (Just like my name implies, I always whine even during on missions, just like a sparrow never stops chirping. A coward and a weakling. The way for someone like me to survive is to always be by the side of someone strong and have them protect me. It's lame. It's pathetic. But it's my way of life.)
 
Sentinel A: What's on today's lunch menu?
 
Sentinel B: I don't wanna go to the afternoon training...
 
Aya: No serious injuries on your last expedition either. Mebuki-senpai, it's amazing how little injuries there are!
 
Suz: It's all because Mebu ordered a swift retreat. 
 
Yum: I wish I could have taken down more Stardust and add more to my extensive list of achievements.
 
Meb: Miroku-san, you really should hold your recklessness back a little. ...We brought back a pretty small amount of soil samples this time around.
 
Aya: You brought back enough to analyse. And the fact nobody dies is much more important.
 
Shi: Sorry, Kusunoki. If only I could've switched places with SHIZUKU then...
 
Meb: It's not like you two can change places whenever you feel like it. Don't worry. And you always bring back the most samples, Shizuku.
 
Shi: ...Mhm.
 
Meb: Excuse me. I'm here to report on the results of the latest mission.
 
Aki: I've already heard about the results.
 
Meb: I see. Well then, excuse me-
 
Aki: Kusunoki-san. You're doing well.
 
Meb: Eh?
 
Aki: Zero casualties amongst the Sentinels. We assumed there would be need for more replacement members.
 
Meb: I'm sure you did. This Sentinel system was created with the premise of the members constantly being swapped out, wasn't it?
 
Aki: Correct. But for us Taisha, the fact there is little need for replacements is desirable. There is not enough time to train the new sentinels, and thus a high possibility they won't be able to accomplish their missions. 
 
Meb: So you care about the missions being accomplished more than their lives.
 
Aki: Correct. 
 
Meb: In my squad, not a single person will die. This is a vow I've made to myself.
 
Aki: Your vow as the commander of the Sentinels?
 
Meb: My vow as a human. During the Christian era, and two years ago there were casualties amongst the Heroes in the battles against the Vertexes, weren't there? The messengers of heavenly gods? Mankind's natural enemy? As if I care! The age of humans being killed by the gods, the heavens or whatever has to be put to an end!
 
Aki: I see. You're dismissed.
 
Meb: Excuse me.
 
Meb: I can't feel any emotions from that priestess, just like always. Does she really mean what she says...
 
Sentinel C: Oh, Kusunoki-san!
 
Sentinel D: Back from training?
 
Meb: No, I was making a report to the priestess. I'm going to be training now.
 
Sentinel D: Whoa, Kusunoki-san, gotta respect your exercise-mindedness. That's our commander!
 
Meb: Exercise-mindedness?..
 
Sentinel C: By the way, Kusunoki-san, there's something t we wanted to ask you about.
 
Sentinel D: Yeah, yeah!
 
Meb: What is it?
 
Sentinel C/D: What kind of person was Miyoshi-sama!?
 
Meb: Eh?
 
Sentinel C: Kusunoki-san! You've met Miyoshi-sama of the Heroes, right?
 
Meb: I have. We were in the same training facility, after all.
 
Sentinel D: We've never met any of the Heroes, so we were wondering what kind of people they were.
 
Sentinel C: They've got to have superhuman strength, right?  Capable of crushing rocks with their fists and running faster than sound!
 
Sentinel D: Oh come on, it wouldn't be something that vulgar. It's gotta be charisma! A blinding divinity and aura making their entire body glow!
 
Meb: What kind of monster do you think they are?.. But wait, so your image of Miyoshi-san is...
 
Kar: Behold, Kusunoki! This is my strength!
 
Meb: What power! She's not even transformed, and she shattered that rock with a jab!
 
Kar: And that's not all! I'm finally able to glow now!
 
Meb: H-How blinding! What radiant divinity!
 
Kar: A perfect Hero has to be able to at least glow!
 
Meb: Nope. Definitely not like that. At all. Miyoshi-san was definitely strong, but about the same as me. She didn't glow either.
 
Sen C: Eeeh, really?
 
Meb: Yeah.
 
Meb: After that, other Sentinels would occasionally come to me and ask the same questions. And I always responded with "Miyoshi Karin was no different from an ordinary human". But... If Miyoshi-san was no different, then why wasn't I the one chosen?
 
Suz: Time to eat! Today's breakfast is udon and mandarins... Mebu, something wrong? You keep looking around.
 
Meb: Not really. I'm just checking if anyone else is going to ask me about Miyoshi Karin again.
 
Yum: You certainly seem to be asked that a lot lately.
 
Suz: Mebu, you're popular~!
 
Meb: That doesn't bring me anything but a headache.
 
Aya: Not many people have seen the Heroes, after all. I've never encountered them either, so I'm curious too.
 
Meb: Aya-chan, you too!?
 
Aya: Ahaha, don't worry, Mebuki-senpai. If you don't want to talk, I won't ask.
 
Yum: Shall we listen to the magnificent history of the Miroku family instead then? I would even present you with my self-published book, "The 300-year history of the Miroku-family"!
 
Suz: No thanks.
 
Shi: No thanks.
 
Yum: But it is a wonderful book!
 
Meb: Miroku family's history aside, I'm sick of answering questions about Miyoshi Karin already. Maybe we should hang a poster in the mess hall. «Miyoshi Karin was somewhat strong at fighting, is the type who does her studies during the last night and had a mania for supplements and dried sardines, but otherwise was a normal person.»
 
Suz: Yeah, that person looked kinda strong, but didn't feel particularly superhuman or anything.
 
Meb: Suzume, you know Miyoshi-san?
 
Suz: Heheheh. In fact... not just Miyoshi-san, I've met all of the current generation Heroes!
 
Meb: Eh? How?
 
Suz: Before I became a Sentinel, I determined where the Heroes were with my investigation skills that would rival a detective!
 
Shi: You're lying.
 
Suz: ...Actually, the leader of the Hero candidate group I was in told me.
 
Aya: But I thought the identities of the Heroes were classified information? Did she really tell you?
 
Suz: I cried her a damn river! Clung to her until she finally told me.
 
Meb: You must've been really annoying.
 
Suz: And then I went to meet them. There was five of them. Miyoshi-san was constantly eating dried sardines and supplements.
 
Meb: She didn't change at all.
 
Suz: If I had to point out something impressive... She discovered my presence when I was trailing them. Also, she threw a ball pen my way so hard it stuck into a wall.
 
Meb: I can do that much too!
 
Yum: Why are you getting competitive?
 
Suz: There were also Inubouzaki Fuu-san and Inubouzaki Itsuki-san. Those sisters really got along well. Itsuki-san, the younger one, was shy and cute, and Fuu-san looked like a reliable big sister.
 
Yum: Big sister... Like me, I assume?
 
Suz: Yeah, not even close.
 
Yum: Gahaa...
 
Suz: The Inubouzaki sisters were nice people, but I didn't feel anything superhuman about them either. Who else was there... Tougou Mimori-san... Ah. Yeah, that person wasn't normal.
 
Meb: R-Really!? So there is some special quality needed to become a Hero? What wasn't normal about her?
 
Suz: Her body had those... Boings! Boings! I couldn't believe we were the same age...
 
Meb: What, her body!? Did you only look at her body!?
 
Shi: Now that you mention it, one of the Heroes at Shinju-kan had a body that looked like anything but an elementary schooler's. Do they pick Heroes according to that?
 
Aya: Ahaha, I don't think it's anything like that. Was there anything else special about her?
 
Suz: She was incredible at handling a computer.
 
Yum: That does sound impressive, but not particularly related to being a Hero.
 
Suz: And last, there was Yuuki Yuuna-san. That girl was the definition of normal. But she was really kind and warm, I guess. When I said I'm a coward and a wimp others are appalled by, Yuuki-san said I was brave. Cowardly, but brave.
 
Yum: Suzume-san? Brave?
 
Aya: I agree! If you weren't brave, you couldn't have protected others on all of the missions so far!
 
Suz: Hmm.... You think so? I don't really get it myself.
 
Meb: So in the end, there's no difference between Heroes and normal humans?	
 
Suz: Mebu?..
 
Meb: So why wasn't I...
 
Suz: Y-You know, Mebu! For me, you're a Hero too! 
 
Meb: ...Suzume?
 
Suz: Not the tiniest bit worse than Miyoshi-san or Yuuki-san! You're amazing, Mebu! I'm serious!
 
Meb: Aren't you just flattering me?
 
Suz: ...Honestly, there's that too.
 
Meb: Su-zu-me...
 
Suz: D-Don't get angry, Mebuuu~! I mean, if you don't protect me, I'll die! A-And anyway, these are my honest feelings too! Mebu, you really are a hero for me!
 
Meb: Good grief... I'll protect you even without flattery. I won't let anyone in my squad die.
 
Suz: Thank you, Mebu! I'm still alive because you're there! Mebu, you really are a hero! 
 
Meb: Stop it! Don't hug me all of a sudden!
 
Suz: Mebu, Mebu! My hero!
 
Aya: Heehee, Mebuki-senpai and Suzume-senpai get along so well.
 
Suz: To survive, I stick to strong people. But who exactly to be with is something I've always chosen myself.
 
Meb: Shortly afterwards, the Taisha priestess gave us our next mission.
 
Aki: The duty of the Sentinels will now be moving from investigation to the next stage.
 
Meb: So our next task will be different?
 
Aki: Correct. You are to plant this seed in the soil outside the wall.
 
Meb: Seed?
 
Aki: It will react to the Miko's prayer, sprout, and vegetation will start growing. If everything goes according to the theory, the place where it was planted will return to being green.
 
Suz: Miko's... prayer? Wait, you're saying to take Ayaya outside!?
 
Aki: Correct. Such a task being expected is one of the reasons Kokudo-san is here.
 
Shi: Kokudo can't fight. We can't do that, it's too dangerous.
 
Meb: Shizuku is right! In the first place, a Miko couldn't possibly bear the heat in the world outside.
 
Aki: Special Miko equipment has been prepared.
 
Meb: But what about the Stardust and the Vertexes?
 
Aki: You Sentinels will simply have to protect her. I'm sure you can do that, Kusunoki-san. It's you we're talking about.
 
Meb: Just what kind of person are you...
 
Aki: We will be counting on you.
 
Yum: Is the next step reviving plant life in the soil outside of the wall, perhaps?
 
Aki: No. We have neither enough time nor enough seeds for that. The places where the seeds are planted will serve as a bridgehead towards a location called the Kinki region in the Christian Era.
 
Sent: Hng!
 
Meb: Haa!
 
Sent: Aah!
 
Meb: Haah!
 
Sent: Oww...
 
Meb: Next!
 
Sent: O-Okay!
 
Meb: Hah!
 
Suz: Eek... Mebu's acting kinda scary today... She's way too serious about this training... 
 
SHI: You could say that again. She beat the shit out of me too.
 
Suz: Uwah, so it's you right now.
 
SHI: Huh? Got a problem with that?
 
Suz: Not at all, SHIZUKU-sama! 
 
Yum: Now then, Mebuki-san. I, Miroku Yumiko, shall serve as your next opponent! I request a bout!
 
Meb: Got it. Get ready, please.
 
Yum: Today, I shall finally take you down, my rival! Teiyaaah!
 
Yum: Gaaah! ...I yield.
 
Meb: All of you, you lack training! At this rate, somebody might eventually lose their life out there! The Taisha doesn't view us as anything more than disposable tools! None of them will protect us! We have to protect ourselves on our own!
 
Yum: Haah... You you certainly appear to be in an ill mood today.
 
Meb: Miroku-san, do you think this is okay? Our next mission is... nothing but clearing the way for the Heroes! And we all, including Aya-chan, are supposed to be risking our lives for something so worthless!?
 
Yum: Of course, I am frustrated about the treatment given to us by the Taisha. However, I ask that you take that "worthless" comment back.
 
Meb: Are you saying it's not!?
 
Yum: Reconnaisance and gaining control of positions are both things crucial in a war.
 
Meb: That's... right, but-
 
Yum: What we are doing right now is, speaking in construction terms, making a foundation. As a daughter of a carpenter, surely you must understand the importance of that!?
 
Meb: ... 
 
Yum: And besides, if we continue completing these tasks, however minute, and make them admit the Sentinels' worth... Eventually even the Taisha shall be incapable of making light of our lives anymore.
 
Meb: ...You're right. It's just as you say, Miroku-san... I'm sorry, everyone. I was just venting out my anger at you.
 
Aya: Aah... It's nice to be able to relax in the large bath when there's nobody around.
 
Meb: ...Yeah.
 
Aya: Mebuki-senpai, you look out of it.
 
Meb: I guess I am.
 
Aya: Suzume-senpai said you got into a fight with Miroku-senpai. Is it because of that?
 
Meb: That Suzume... What a blabbermouth. It wasn't a fight. I was completely in the wrong, and Miroku-san scolded me for that.
 
Aya: Mebuki-senpai getting scolded by Miroku-senpai... I can't even imagine that.
 
Meb: I was mad at the way the Taisha treats us. And let that anger out on the rest. 
 
Aya: So that's what it was...
 
Meb: The Taisha views human lives too lightly... And on the next mission even you are going to be put in danger...
 
Aya: Thank you for worrying about me. But I'll be fine. I'm even a little glad about being to participate. 
 
Meb: ...Glad? Aren't you scared?
 
Aya: I am. My hands are still shaking. And when we're outside, I might even break down and start crying. But all of you  have to endure that pain and fear all the time, right? So... I'm glad I'll be able to do something for everyone and not just be a useless decoration.
 
Meb: (Even Aya-chan, who can't fight, and should really be more scared than anyone else is being so brave... There's only one thing left for me to do, then.)
 
Meb: Don't worry, Aya-chan. We will definitely protect you. We won't let the Stardust and the Vertexes put a finger on you.
 
Aya: Mebuki-senpai... Thank you.
 
Meb: *Sigh* That's right. Whining like a child won't solve anything. I just need to do what I have to do.
 
Aya: Heehee, that's our Mebuki-senpai. But I think it's fine to be a bit childish. Mebuki-senpai, I think you're trying to be an adult way too soon. And the childish side of you is cute too.
 
Meb: Don't say embarassing things like that, Aya-chan! Jeez.
 
Aya: Ehehe.
 
Meb: Alright, that's the morning run over.
 
Yum: Haah, haah... To run two laps across Daisoku from the early morning... Do you do this everyday?
 
Meb: After this, I do shooting and bayonet training.
 
Yum: You really are obsessed with training.
 
Meb: I didn't expect you to tag along with me for the run, Miroku-san? What brought this on?
 
Yum: I decided that I would commit to the same training regimen as you, Mebuki-san, starting today. To get even slightly stronger, for the glory of the Miroku house!
 
Meb: You're the same as always, Miroku-san.
 
Yum: Of course. I must say, you look much better than you did yesterday, Mebuki-san.
 
Meb: I got a load off my chest. Miroku-san, it's thanks to you.
 
Yum: Hehe! Feel free to respect me even more!
 
Meb: You'll get too cocky, so that's it for now.
 
Yum: Eh? Ah? Well, so be it. While I have my frustrations about the state of affairs, right now we have no choice but to do what we can.
 
Meb: That's what you've been doing all this time, haven't you? No matter what task it was, you didn't let out even a word of complaint...
 
Yum: Of course. The Miroku house, which was originally as esteemed as the Akamine family, is now in ruins. And if it was to restore its good name, I would even eat dirt. My ancestors saved the lives of many people during the large-scale terrorism of DE 72. And I feel proud to be the descendant of such heroes.
 
Meb: Miroku-san... I think I've finally began to like you.
 
Yum: Wha!? ...Wait, what do you mean "finally"?
 
Meb: I think we might be similar. Let's accomplish anything the Taisha throws at us beyond their expectations. Me for the sake of becoming a Hero, and you for the sake of restoring your family. 
 
Yum: Yeah, but of course.
 
Meb: (And so, our mission finally began.)
 
Meb: Protector squad, deploy shields! Defend the Miko from the Stardust!
 
Sentinels: Roger!
 
Suz: Roger!
 
Meb: Gunner squad, focus on taking down the approaching Stardust!
 
Sentinels: Roger!
 
Meb: (The world outside feels even hotter than usual today... Is my battle suit malfunctioning? Or...)
 
Shi: Kusunoki. According to the map on the terminal, this should be the place.
 
Meb: Thanks. Plant the seed in the soil... Aya-chan, it's up to you.
 
Aya: Okay. O gods of the land. Let this day be one a tree root sprouteth. As sprouteth the root, so shall earth make merry. If be earth the wife, then be root the husband. In kind heart...
 
Meb: (The seed is sprouting roots and the greenery is covering the scorching ground. There's a whole field now... Amazing. So many plants just from one seed?)
 
Suz: Gyaaah! Save me, Mebu!
 
Meb: Eh!?
 
Suz: There's something huge!
 
Meb: Ah... That's... The Scorpio Vertex! Protector squad, brace for impact! The tail is coming!
 
Sentinels: Aaaaah!
 
Suz: Mebu, that did nothing! The ones hit by the tail were just sent flying!
 
Meb: Guh... The rest of the officer-types, take the rest and the Miko and retreat! Make sure everyone gets back alive!
 
Sentinels: Roger!
 
Aya: Mebuki-senpai, what about you?
 
Meb: I'm going to slow Scorpio down.
 
Aya: No way...
 
Meb: Aya-chan, go.
 
Aya: You have to return safe!
 
Meb: Everyone, commence retreat!
 
Sentinels: Roger!
 
SHI: Alright, so we're keeping the scorpion bastard here busy then!
 
Meb: SHIZUKU? Suzume? Miroku-san? Why did you stay behind? I ordered everyone to retreat.
 
Suz: There's no way I can leave you alone, Mebu! If you have no shield, who's going to have your back!?
 
Yum: Mebuki-san. No casualties implies that you too, must stay alive.
 
Meb: Everyone...
 
SHI: More importantly, what are we gonna do about that scorpion? 
 
Meb: The worst thing about Scorpio is the venomous stinger on the tail. We need to cut it off.
 
SHI: Can we do that?
 
Meb: The four of us... Will pull it off. I have a plan.
 
Sentinel E: Are you okay, Kokudo-san?
 
Aya: Yeah, I'm fine. But...
 
Aya: (Mebuki-senpai... Please come back safe!)
 
Meb: So you're here, Scorpio! Suzume, you first!
 
Suz: Gyaaah! Save me!
 
Meb: (First of all, Suzume will divert its tail with her shield. And after that, I will jump on it!)
 
Meb: Haah!
 
Suz: She did it! Mebu's right on top of it!
 
Meb: (When I'm on, I'll aim with my bayonet at the joint between the spheres, and slash at it! However many times! It takes to! Cut it off!)
 
Suz: Mebu, look out! The stinger!
 
Meb: (And when Scorpio aims at me with its needle...)
 
Yum: Leave knocking the tail away to us!
 
SHI: Dammit, couldn't these guns be a little stronger!? Even just knocking it away is taking a ton of effort!
 
Yum: I beg that you hurry up, Mebuki-san! We cannot keep this up for much longer!
 
Meb: I know! Just a little more! Haah! Did it! It came off!
 
Suz: We did it! Mebu!
 
Meb: Its attack power dropped significantly. Now we just need to look out the tail swings and retreat while covering for the rest of the squad!
 
Suz: We can finally run away!
 
Yum: I should have been the one to slice its tail off! Mebuki-san, you stole my spotlight yet again!
 
SHI: Hey, you wreck of a princess! Stop blabbering and get your move on!
 
Suz: We did it! We're finally back!
 
Aya: I'm so glad... I'm so glad everyone got back here safely... 
 
Meb: Don't exaggerate, Aya-chan.
 
Aya: I'm not exaggerating! Do you know how worried I was about all of you? *sob*
 
Suz: Aah, Mebu made Ayaya cry~.
 
Meb: Suzume!
 
Yum: Zero casualties. Goal achieved today as well.
 
SHI: Damn right.
 
Meb: You're right. Everyone, I want to thank you. The officers, for safely leading everyone back to the wall. The protectors, for defending everyone. The gunners, for taking down the Stardust blocking the escape route. Thanks to everyone's efforts, nobody died.
 
Sentinel D: What are you saying? We all came back alive thanks to you, Kusunoki-san.
 
Sentinel C: Yeah, it's probably because of your strict training, heehee.
 
Sentinel E: And you make sure everybody stays alive as our commander, too.
 
Sentinels: Yeah, yeah. You're right. Definitely
 
SHI: That's how it is, Kusunoki.
 
Yum: Mebuki-san, I believe you can be proud of yourself.
 
Meb: Everyone... Thank you.
 
Meb: (Before becoming a Sentinel, I always used to be on my own. I got used to being alone. But... Things are different now. I have so many... reliable friends.)
