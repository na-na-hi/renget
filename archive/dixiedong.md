It was a quiet day on DK Island, and it was especially boring over at Candy Kong's neck of the woods. She hadn't seen anyone at her little booth all day and she was so bored that she was starting to nod off. Maybe that's why she didn't notice when someone finally approached until they made themselves known with an overly-dramatic,

"A-hem!"

Candy snapped to attention, looking out over her counter to see... nothing? Nothing except for a pink beret that was just barely poking up from behind her counter. It was Dixie Kong, the adorable little scamp who'd always been by Diddy's side. Candy didn't know too much about the lil' ponytailed ape personally, but if she was a friend of Diddy's that meant she was a friend of hers!

"Well hey there little cutie," Candy cooed in her effortlessly sultry voice, "What can I do for y--"

CLUNK!

Candy's spiel was cut short by Dixie practically slamming a banana coin on the counter.

"Yeah, I'm looking for one of THOSE!" Dixie said, pointing just a bit to Candy's left.

Candy looked over where Dixie had pointed to a small sign with bold lettering that read: "KISSES: 1 BANANA COIN EACH!". She felt herself blush; she'd hung up that sign primarily for her big ape Donkey Kong (or for Diddy if he was lucky) but the idea of smooching Dixie felt a little lewd. Especially with the way she leered up at Candy, sporting a lecherous smile that despite being hidden behind the counter was fully visible in her eager eyes. Still, cash was cash and she certainly didn't wanna come off as rude. She'd give Dixie a little peck on the cheek and be done with it, easy as coconut cream pie.

Candy gave her a big smile as she said, "Alright then sweetie, hop up and I'll--"

Dixie leapt up onto the counter and Candy's jaw dropped. Hanging between Dixie's hairy little legs, wrapped up tight in a hot pink speedo that matched her tanktop and beret, was an absolutely obscene banana bulge. Candy thought for a second that Dixie might've been packing a plantain in those shorts of hers, but the thought was quickly dispelled as Dixie casually rolled down her panties and bucked her hips, letting her sloppy, sweaty schlong flop free. The thing was so long that it nearly slapped Candy in the face when she unpacked it. What DID slap Candy in the face, though, was the stink of the thing.

Candy knew better than anyone that it was tough getting a shower in the jungle, but it seemed like the thought had never even crossed Dixie's mind. The hazy fog of fuckstink rolling off of her cock was so thick that was visible, wafting into Candy's dumbstruck face like the heat off a tiki torch. The odor only got worse as Dixie slipped one of her grubby mitts around the midsection of her halfhard and started pumping it to full mast, splattering greasy dicksweat all over the countertop. All the while she kept looking straight at Candy, smugly watching how the older ape had her eyes completely transfixed on her pungent prick.

"So," Dixie said, wagging her dick at Candy, "Am I gonna get that kiss or what?"

It was about then that Candy realized she was drooling. The thing was absolutely disgusting, Dixie's dong was a banana and a half long and crisscrossed with throbbing veins, fuming fuckreek into the air and practically pickled with her own pungent dicksweat that dripped off in thick salty globs. And yet she was completely spellbound. Maybe it was that heady odor hitting her brain like gasoline, melting her inhibitions away and popping her braincells with every sniff. She started to lean forward before she even knew what she was doing and planted her lips right on the fat, drooling tip of Dixie's dong.

Dixie sneered, "Aw that's cute, but I was thinking you'd gimme a kiss somewhere else... like say, my pelvis?"

Candy felt a hand on the back of her head and before she could react, Dixie grabbed a fistful of her hair and slammed her forward, punching her prick straight down into Candy's gullet. Candy choked, snot and spit sputtering out of her face as Dixie tried to shove the entirety of her massive monkey meat into her unprepared throat. But, despite her best efforts, Dixie managed to only plunge her unwilling onahole a little more than halfway down the length of her dong.

"I thought you were a lot more experienced than this," Dixie huffed, grabbing onto Candy's head with both hands, "Well whatever, I guess if you want something done right you gotta do it yourself! Hope you're not gonna need any oxygen for the next few minutes."

Dixie pulled her hips back, roughly dragging a few inches of her schlong out of Candy's throat before pumping back in deeper. She drew back again, then slammed back in. Every painful, forceful thrust of Dixie's hips served to slam that simian schlong further down Candy's painfully stretched esophagus, all while Candy could do nothing but choke and sputter on the end of Dixie's dong like a fish stuck on a hook. It was a long, painful process and Candy felt like both her lungs and her brain were on fire, but soon enough Dixie had managed to pummel her python deep enough into Candy's face that,

"NNnf, almost, just a little... NNFFH!"

Dixie thrust forward one last time, slamming her crotch right into Candy's face. Her fat nuts slapped up against Candy's chin one last time before tensing up, bouncing in their sack as Dixie gushed out a load of her glue-thick monkey spunk directly into Candy's belly. As she climaxed, Dixie slowly pulled out of Candy's abused throat, pumping ropes the entire time and making sure that every inch of Candy's airway was plastered with a spackling of her reeking jizz. She pumped the last of her load straight onto Candy's tongue to make sure she got a good taste of exactly what Dixie was serving up. Her poor tastebuds were absolutely smothered in the salty, musky flavor and Candy was certain she'd never fully wash the taste out of her mouth. As Dixie wiped her cock off in Candy's hair, she told her,

"Not bad, but I figured a gal like YOU would be waaaay better. All looks and no skill huh? Or maybe you're just rusty. Now that I've warmed ya up, how about another lil kiss?"

Dixie bounced a banana coin off Candy's rack as she was swallowing the last of that tenaciously thick load. Before she could even think about where Dixie wanted her next "kiss", the cheeky little monkey went right ahead and showed her. She spun around, stuck her little bubble butt out, and grabbed Candy to pull her in for an intimate makeout with her musky monkey pucker.

"Hope you don't mind doing a bit of cleanup back there, I really worked up a sweat!" Dixie snickered, "And don't be afraid to show my coconuts a little love too, huh? After all, they did just feed you a hearty meal! Thicker than coconut cream and more nutritious than a golden banana, and you can bet I'll have more for ya once I recharge my lil' barrel blaster."

Candy Kong couldn't even find the energy to be upset. She was so totally broken by that brutal facefuck that she just let herself be dragged up and down Dixie's swampy crack like a sweat rag, planting kisses on her asshole and balls as she went. Her makeup was ruined, her hair was a mess, and she was now carrying what felt like ten pounds in pure Dixie sauce in her guts. There wasn't enough banana coins in the world to justify this treatment, and yet somewhere in the back of Candy's half-melted brainpan she was strangely excited for whatever awful treatment Dixie had in store for her next.

After Candy was done slurping on her asscrack, of course.
