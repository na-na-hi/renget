![A stalwart soldier, dedicated to the protection of his father's holdings and all that live in them](https://archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/6/6e/625Bisharp_Dream.png) 

### General Razor, Blade Breaker ♂
General Razor is the proud son of a prominent landowner who has become too frail to rule. Regardless, Razor is utterly devoted to his father, seeing him as an honorable Commander brought low only by the ravages of time. Having proven himself against all candidates, he commands the Iron Legion effectively to defend the lands (and those that live within them) his father earned through nearly a century of service. Within the Legion, he is revered as his father was; a caring and fearless leader. Despite the warlike nature of his species, he is more than capable of brokering peace deals and other such treaties. 

However effective he is on the battlefield, he always worries about living up to his father's example. In addition, he worries greatly that his youth may cause the other nobles of the Clan Council to not respect him or his opinion on matters. Within the higher ranks of his clan, he is known as the Lord of the Iron Legion, and the Daggersworn Scion of Commander Grandblade the Unifier. To his father, whom he bested in single combat, he will always be Gleaming Helm.

Within Clan Hematite as a whole, he is a somewhat controversial figure. His journeys across the world have led him to believe that should any other faction declare war, they will quickly be defeated due to their lack of development. His home village has been more accepting of some changes, but the other villages fear that he may try to get rid of their traditions. While he tries to balance modernization with tradition, he fears that war is on the horizon. Within 50 years, he believes there will be war or he will be challenged for his position. Should the latter happen, his greatest fear is that should his work not bear swift fruit, his successor will undo all of the progress he has made. His attempts to sway the rest of the council to his view have not been very fruitful either.
