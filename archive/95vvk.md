# A Warning Sign

Gabriel sat in a hoverchair, spinning around in the observatory of his ship. It was quite the spacious room, even when combined with the lounge. The seating was comfortable, with a leather interior, built-in heating, comfy cushions--oh, to die for. And the view... it was beautiful. The quartz glass screen was utterly massive, letting Gabriel see every inch of the cosmos that lay beyond his ship. You could spend hours counting every star. Well, if he wasn't distracted by the myriad of gadgets and screens present in the lounge already. Ah, sweet luxury. He was feeling quite glad about the investment into the quality of his ships. He'll have no shortage of his entertainment!

*RUMBLE*

Gabriel stops spinning in his chair and perks up, looking around the observatory. A Gazer operative raises an eyebrow and establishes a link with the radar room on a small terminal in the corner of the room.

>"What was that? Was that Cedrick? I told him to not emulate flight turbulence. It wasn't funny the first time, and it certainly isn't funny the se-"
>
>"Admiral. Our shields are getting hit. Magnetic bombardment from enemy fleet... two clicks away."
>
Gabriel perks up even further, kicking his feet from the table and onto the ground. He stands up immediately, turning his head towards the Gazer. 
>
>"And *who's* bombing us, Sebastian?"
>
>"...You won't be happy."
>
>"Sebastian. My ship is enduring high speed kinetic bombardment like a drunk uncle in a superhero costume at a 9 year old's birthday party. I'm already not happy."
>
>"A Glaive, four Longbows, eight Sabres and a bunch of other stragglers. They're a Red Da-" 
>
>"**FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCKING PIRAAAAAAAAAATES!** NO ONE MESSES WITH **MY** FAMILY AND LEAVES UNSCATHED! ZETTA, GET MY **FUCKING** COAT!"

Sebastian winces at the volume, then rolls his eyes as if to say "I told you so", going back to running diagnostics checks on the terminal. Zetta walks over to a hanger, gingerly picking up a long black coat with amethyst highlights. Gabriel begins walking down a corridor, tightening his gloves and noting something down on a holographic tablet. Zetta eventually catches up, throwing the coat around Gabriel. He quickly stuffs his arms into the sleeves of the coat, adjusting the hat on his head and popping the coat's collar. 

>"ZETTA, BEGIN PILOTING THE SHIP IN TANDEM WITH CEDRICK. CEDRICK, BE A DEAR AND REROUTE THE POWER FROM GENERAL SYSTEMS TO SHIELDING, ENGAGE FORTRESS PROTOCOL."

Zetta nods, and walks off in another direction into another winding corridor. Gabriel continues to briskly walk before eventually reaching an intercom. He plants his hand against a scanner, and not before long, a mic pops out with a hiss. He taps on it a few times before clearing his throat.

!!! danger "AHEM-HEM"
	"Attention, you dusty bastards. You may have felt that rumbling. Worry not my companions, our lovely ship will not go down due to disrepair! Instead, we are being attacked by our *friends*--the pirates! So you know what time it is? That's *right*! **GET OFF YOUR ASSES**, AND ***MAN THE FUCKING STATIONS! WOOOHOOOHAHA!***"

He practically roars the last bit into the mic, before shutting the mic closed and walking into a command center room. He plops himself down into a seat, pulling up his sleeve to reveal a bracelet embedded into his arm. He hooks it up to the and a holographic interface pops up in front of him

He fumbles around a bit with the UI, before another a message interrupts what he was doing.

!!! info Communication Channel Connected

He adjusts his hat one more time, before speaking up.

>"You know the drill. Train the Anti-Matters onto the Longbows. Railguns on the Sabres, all other guns onto the rest of the peons. But, a request. Spare the Glaive. Rooks, once the combat drones and the lasso have completed formation, pilot the powersuit along with two other operatives. You'll get aboard the Lamprey and then enter the Glaive. Kill them all, but leave their top officers.
> *I'd like to have a word with them.*
A silence hangs in the air, but only for a moment as Gabriel pipes up happily.
 >Cheerio then! Good luck and have fun! Make sure you don't get the blood of *mutts* on you! I'll be in the digital security room if you need me.
He unhooks the bracelet and kills the connection. He cracks his knuckles before leaving the room and heading towards the direction of the digital security room. He was going to slowly strangle every ship in the opposing fleet, before crushing them and scattering them to the solar winds. 

------ 
A few hours after the initial engagement, the opposing ships were obliterated--massive piles of debris and dust now floating aimlessly in space, with the Glaive being non operational, as dead as a doorknob. The defense was a complete success and now Gabriel waited patiently for the leading officers of the ship to be escorted from the ship into the holding cells. He stood up from the seat and proceeded to exit the digital security room, performing a few stretches. Nothing like a stretch after a nice hacking sesh. Walking down another winding corridor, he called for a few Gazers to accompany him to visit the holding cells. Once he arrived, he sat down on a seat located in front of a rather cold and dull looking cell. Peering inside, he saw the visage of multiple rugged and dirty looking men and women, all in fancy overcoats adorned with exotic furs.
>"Good... good evening? Morning? Oh, it doesn't matter. Welcome to the Ars Goetia! Hope your stay has been... satisfactory! Who wants to start? Which one of you is the commander?"
No one even blinked. Complete silence. Gabriel tilted his head curiously.
>"No? No one? Alright. You have one minute to pipe up! Lest you want nails and tongues to start coming off."
They looked very visibly nervous now, but no one thought of speaking up. Gabriel is counting down the seconds in his head, staring emotionlessly at each prisoner through his helmet as if to appraise their worth to him.
>"And... zero. Sure! You wanna play that way, be my guest! Hmm.. take that one, the one with the brown hair and scar on her nose."
The woman perks up, surprised to be singled out. A bead of sweat slides down her face as two Gazers step in, pulling her out and throwing her under Gabriel. Gabriel plants his boot on her neck,  motioning for a Gazer to come over to him. The Red Dagger officer gasps for air under the weight of Gabriel, and he snaps his fingers impatiently.
>"Stick a knife under her nail. *Pop it out*."
Her eyes go wide and she stumbles over her words, spluttering as she attempts to spit out a response.
>"WA-WAIT! I'll t-tell you, I'll tell you! P-PLEASE!"
>
> "Well? Who is it then?"
>
>"It's... it's him. The man with the green eyes, the auburn one. He's the commander. We're just officers working under him."
>
>"Good, good! Thank you. See, it's not *THAT* hard to give me an answer, is it? Anyways, peel it."
>
>"Wh-what?"
The Gazer digs the knife into her finger and her face twists with terror, screaming shrilly in anguish before the Gazer rips the knife out out. A nail goes flying across the floor, blood pouring from her finger. She thrashes around before Gabriel takes his foot off her neck, and she curls up, grabbing her finger. 
>"Sorry, I took no pleasure in doing that. But, c'mon. I asked you nicely! You can't just get off scot-free. Ahem-hem. Alright. Bring him out then."
A Gazer drags the woman back into the cell, throwing her to the side and pulling out the green eyed man. He trembles a bit as he's brought to his knees in front of Gabriel.
>"Welcome aboard the Ars Goetia! I hope we haven't roughed you up too bad. Now, be a dear and tell me--who sent you?"
>
>"...No one. No one sent me."
Gabriel scoffs, looking to the side and putting a hand on his hip as if to say "Look at the nerve of this guy!" before kicking him in the face with his boot which sends a tooth spinning out of his mouth. The man collapses onto his face, groaning and heaving heavily. 
>"You're telling me... a pirate fleet randomly comes up to us after exiting hyperspace, and starts shooting at me before even establishing a comm link, and no one sent you? We're in Sector Z, just a few systems away from Ten Cred--and no one sent you? Let's try that again. **Who** sent you?" 
There's a pause before the man speaks up again.
>"My.. my name is Esteban รณ Dubhghaill. I'm--"
>
>"Get to the point."
>
>"The man who sent me is Doran Murphy, he... he told me that... he wanted to send you a message. Y-you... stole valuable artifacts off him. And... he'd have a bounty on your head."
>
>"A message? Why didn't you just comm me?"
>
>"He... he thought it would get the po-point across if we bombarded you. F-FUCK. That was f-fucking stupid."
Gabriel shrugs.
>"Well, I mean, I guess it did work--but more importantly. NO. I didn't STEAL. I simply got there *first*. I said he could have everything he found. I found it first, so TECHNICALLY, he didn't find anything. Don't you know how finders keepers work? I *find* Herald artifacts on an abandoned moon, I *keep* the artifacts. You're not even Doran, why am I--ugh."
Gabriel helmetpalms, taking a deep breath.
>"If you want to live, go help us set up a comm link in the Red Daggers channel. I have a few choice words for him."

-> Meanwhile... <-

A large bearded man sits alone, signing off some paperwork and idly fiddling with a pen in a large messy office. Trophies were littered around the room, along with contracts and bounties that have been stabbed to various walls with knives. A rather imposing safe sits in the corner of a room, next to a paper map of Ten Cred's star system with key business locations on different planets and moons. He grumbles to himself as he signs another piece of paper. Pirates aren't supposed to do paperwork. 

A nearby computer comes to life as Gabriel's face pops up on it with a crackle.

!!! warning New Communications Link Established
    "Ahem... pleasantries or no.. hmm. Oh, hello Doran! I trust you have been well? I thought our last business deal went off swimmingly! What's the big idea, pal?"

Doran nearly jumps out of his seat, looking at the screen in shock.

>"YOU! You have access to the channel? How?"
>
>"Your officers were kind enough to let me in! How nice! Am I part of a secret club now."
>
>"Those... I'll have them all HUNG HIGH for this. But.. first.."
Doran narrows his eyes and stands up instantly, walking over to the screen, pointing an accusatory finger at Gabriel.
>"You. Lying. Bastard. You said there would be Herald technology for us there. The entire moon was stripped bare when we went there to check."
>
>"Oh, I'm the scoundrel? Those vehicles you provided me were all faulty! I tried to pilot a buggy and it broke down into pieces like a decade old model kit! I figured you'd do something like that, so I simply... had a failsafe. Hoho! And you ate it right up!" 
Doran grits his teeth angrily, silently seething and starring daggers (get it?) at Gabriel, who is laughing innocently onscreen. Gabriel stops laughing, tilting his head at the bearded man before inquiring him.
>"So, what's this about a bounty?"
>
>"Ha. Hahahahaha. You scum fuck piece of *shit*. I've put a bounty on your head for 250M. It'll only go up as you go on with your pathetic. Worthless. Life. You'll have countless people trying to stick your head onto the hull of their ships. There won't be a moment of REST for you."
Gabriel laughs nonchalantly, nodding his head. Doran sneers derisively at the helmeted man on the screen, voice full of contempt.
>"Yeah? That feeling setting in? You're. FUCKED. You'll have someone on your a--"
>
>"Let them come then. One or a hundred, ten or a million. You can throw as many fleets and men as you want at me, it doesn't matter. I'll make orphans of all their children and widows of all their wives! Mercy? None. I'll set this galaxy on fire, if I so wish. In fact, broadcast this message to as many people as you'd like! Let this be a warning sign. It is a non issue!"
>
>"..."
>
>"Silent are we? Brilliant, then that's all for today! Oh, and if I ever see you in-person again, I'll nail you to a cross and feed you to the dogs. Toodles!"
Gabriel closes the comm link before turning to Zetta, yawning.
>"Alright. I'm feeling rather merciful today! Set course for a neutral system. Drop off the officers, I said they'd live, and I'm a man of my word!"
>
>"We killed their men, sir. They'll want revenge."
>
>"Pfft, so? What'll they do? Kill me? HA. Not like they haven't tried to do that already."
Zetta sighs, leaving the hypercomms room. Gabriel leans back and kicks his feet onto a nearby terminal. Bounty, hm? Wonder how big it'll get in the coming years.
