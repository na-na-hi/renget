#/akg/ Terra: The Journey edited MTL

**I am ESL so the english at times(or all the time) may sound unnatural, so keep that in mind**

**What is "MTL edit"?**
**As ESL, I cannot make a decent Chinese-English translation by myself, so I do it this way: I open Chinese original and English MTL at the same time, read the text in Chinese and translate it into my native language(in mind). After that I check the English MTL and write the translation, using the sentence structure generated by MTL.**

**Articles about the countries are listed in the order of my personal interest in them. Order in the original book is different. **
