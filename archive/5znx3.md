#Cold Awakening
##part 1

_A very sharp pain awoke me, it was cold, extremely so, i found myself i was not wearing any clothes, and that i was recieving the cold air against my body directly, rather than sleeping under 2 layers of covers like i used to._

_As i look down to myself i notice, im not even human, my hands and arms are replaced by wings, of a color... Im guessing lavender? With tiny claws And my chest has, not hair, but fur, and only the upper part, and so do my hips, my belly is exposed to the cold, and as im gathering my thoughts, im made even more aware of this, as my body shivers violently thanks to a small draft, i look arround, the space is open, but a wall covered in ice calls my attention, as i can barely see my reflection on it, walking up to it i get to see my face covered in fur, with round yellow eyes and round ears that are connected, and my nose splitting into two and spreading onto my face. The reflection, tough clearly imperfect, lets me understand the situation; im a monster... a POCKET monster... A ==Pok√©mon!== A ==Noibat!== Who knew that being a massive nerd would come in handy like this?_

_Now that i understand what i am... I gotta figure out the where... Im surrounded by ice, and rock,  and there's a hole besides me... With a open roof... So a Frozen Ravine perhaps? There's no roof, so i could fly away in theory... If i knew how to fly. Im barely getting used to this body with this cold. Not going to risk being frozen midair and falling down._

_Right, the cold. Being a noibat, a Flying Dragon type my body is extremely vulnerable to the cold... 
I wasnt even that used to the cold before, it didnt even snow back where i was, being so close to the coast, and i had the luxury to study from home, warm in my sheets... I had it good... Finding myself reflecting on my old life, i look at the imperfect reflection again..._

_...And i see im not alone, spotting a white blur that was not behind me before. A floating, frozen white face, with azure eyes and short, sharp black horns, god i forgot what this thing was called, always tought it was some sort of dex filler shitmon, ==Glaile== or something_

???: "er, Hello?"

_but he did not answer on a traditional way, as i was received by a hostile growl and a attack  consisting of multiple shards of ice launched at me in high speed. that caught me off guard, it was hostile, and it most likely had the potential to kill me._

_I inmediatly ran away, my whole body telling me im in danger, this is what having instincts is like? It feels like its eating away my thought process, wish i didnt have to run, but im actually getting cold feet here, and boy does it hurt._

_Well, guess i should listen to my instincts, i begin to flap my wings, on the attempt to get away, theres a hallway there, so my focus is there, just get away. My body actually lifts off the ground, but i barely lift my own weight, so i dont make it more than a few inches away from the ground. But its enough to get away into the hallway._

_But then things got worse. Something else got in my path. Another. ==Glaile.== And it was blocking my way of escape. **Thanks Instincts.**_

_Tension high, my nerves wrecked, and no longer knowing what to do i try and scream in horror, but to my surprise the following loud noise i made was a screech. one loud and horrified enough that instead left the pokemon in front of me ==confused==,  i wonder what move i used? just as the other glaile was coming into the hallway. I took my chance, to get away, as the second glaile bashed its face against the wall i touched the cold stone beneath me and scurried under him, like vermin trying to escape extermination, the glaile's blocking eachother's progress in said hallway._

_As i enter the next room, im hit with reflected sunlight on my eyes, courtesy of a bright, orange disc on the ground, maybe a ==Technical machine?==. The rest of the room was empty, partially illuminated by sunlight, and having a set of ==stairs== that lead... Downwards. There's no other exit here. And not even another hallway._

_The reality of the situation hits me. this is most likely a mystery dungeon... Meaning that the only exit is diving further in. **oh IM FUCKED.**_

_Well i better improve my odds, that TM there is bright, burning orange, so it must be fire... Or maybe even fighting type but ... I got no idea how it works.
Maybe... You consume it so maybe if i bite it? Do you eat this i... God no that's probably extremely stupid, you were going to put this into your mouth, me, dont do that! You Dumb fuck!_

_The very short moment of peace i had is short lived, i hug the TM in panic, as i see the two glaile's enter the room, with small amounts of scratches decorating both of their bodies._

_Yet my panic stops as the information of the Move in the TM enters my being!
With my body high in adrenaline i use the move without hesitation, a strong wave of very hot air, flows out of me and fills the entire room, the sudden change in temperature breaking some of the ice that's clinging to the walls, with the burning air rushing violently against the ice type pokemon, they drop down onto the ground, hitting the much softer snow wich was slowly melting away, their eyes clearly indicating they are defeated_

"...Holy fuck, that was ==Heat Wave!== I did that?! I did that! Yess! Lucky i had found this TM and- oh"

_Looking down, the disc has lost its orange shine, and much of the reflective look it once had._

"One time use i guess. But it does not matter too- **AWGH FUCK!"**

_One of the glaile's clearly did not take enough punishment, as it rises with a much more angry look in its eyes, the glare of the white face is, frankly terrifying, but i think to myself, if that wasn't enough to beat them then i have a very rough road ahead of me, and my chance of survival here was very much null, still ready to face the dangers ahead, i prepare myself, as the cold frozen face is readying up some sort of breath of ice from its mouth._

_But a ball of fire is shot trough the hallway, blindsiding not just the glaile, whom the projectile was aimed at, but caught me off guard as well, the strong hit knocking the glaile off the air, and launching it onto the wall from the sheer power the blast had, the glaile, now finds his horns burried against the wall, as it looses conciousness, me, left awestruck from the attack, as a soft warm wind careses my face, a small leftover from the attack._

???: "...who the heck?!"

_A trio of female pokemon, enter the scene, a ==Armarouge==, a fire/Psychic pokemon clad in armor and fire, a ==Medicham==, a psychic/fighting pokemon wearing magenta and plump lips, and a ==Indeedee==, a normal/psychic pokemon, with dark purple fur accentuated with white... They were all wearing wearing white scarves, decorated with a cherry red heart symbol, and a golden badge... Even the fact that they are so bottom heavy looks to be in uniform._

_Before i can even say anything, the armarouge speaks out in a reliable, but commanding voice_

Armarouge: "you're not from arround here, little bat. Want us to keep you close?"

_I blink for a moment, before giving them a nod without thinking, looks like my mind is captivated by the trio of females._

Indeedee: "Here, let me heal you up."
Medicham: "Poor thing is probably confused, this mystery dungeon appeared with a earthquake, it wasnt even cold on this area."

_Perfect excuse, i can use that as a abilii... Dont have to tell them the truth..._

Armarouge: "Stay behind us. We will get you out of here"
???: "yes Ma'am... And thank you." _I reply softly. Trying to catch my breath in a small moment of peace._

_i follow behind them, up the stairs, trying my best to be respectful and avert my gaze from their behinds, as we go lower onto the ravine_

_The next room is empty, still nervous i ask them_
???: "S-So- you are?"

Armarouge: "We go by team ==CraftHeart==. My name is Gwen. and these are... my partner Fa, and our short apprentice; Mimi. We are a ==Rescue Team==" 
???: "Nice to meet you all."

_That sealed it. I was on the mystery dungeon universe. And this... Recofirmed it. Now ive-_

Mimi: "So what is your name?"
???: "My name? I... Uh...
...I cant remember. Sorry. I only remember waking up here."

_Shit. I hadn't tought of a name, i was too focused on everything else! The cold! The shock! The fear! **Their buttcheeks!** No, bad, keep it in your... pants? Does that expression even work here nobody wears pants. **oh god those butts are bare**_

Mimi: "I wonder if he just forgot by the shock of the fall..."
Fa: "...I dont think that's quite it..." _The medicham said, squinting her eyes at me._
Gwen: "Whatever the case, we need something to call you... You're rather small, and can move rather quickly... So ill give you the nickname "Bullet" until you remember"

_Ah... Bullet? Not the worst name i could have received. Ill go with it._

Bullet: "Once again, Thank you- ah!"

_I pointed out to a rooms hallway, a ==beartic== coming onto view._
_...yet without hesitation, the medicham quickly jumps up onto the air, and hit a powerful kick onto its face, knocking it out instantly._

Mimi: "...was it even hostile?"
Fa: "I could tell by its aura, it was much different. Speaking of..."

_The medicham strikes a glare at me, it was no mistaking it now. She most likely knew something was off._

Fa: "Your aura is weird, it feels like ours, but like its making small sparks out of you... What are you?"

_i take a deep breath, still unsure if i can trust these pokemon, and now im being questioned like this._

Bullet: "Look, it wont matter if we dont leave this dungeon alive... So, how about we leave, and ill give you a proper explaination? Even tough... I frankly do not know what this "aura" is"
Gwen: "He is correct, we do not have time to waste on this, we need to reach the end of the ==Frozen Ravine==. Besides... he woke up weak, with lacking combat ability, he's anything but a threat."
Bullet:"...Shes correct, but part of me feels... Insulted."
Mimi: "Dont worry about it! Im sure you'll get much stronger soon!"
