###Chapter 1: Inigo

It was a chilly September afternoon at Shiketsu High. Classes had just ended and students were busy running to their respective clubs. Inigo had decided to skip out on soccer practice today. He paused outside the door to Hijack-sensei's office, steeling himself. Then, taking a deep breath, he knocked firmly.

"Come in," came a mellow reply.

Inigo entered, fiddling with his tie. Hijack glanced up from his paperwork with an expectant look.

"You ready, Myoga?"

Inigo cleared his throat, meeting his teacher's concerned gaze. "Yes, sensei. I'd like you to use your  quirk to disable my connection with Gigan. Just for a little bit." 

He closed the door and sat opposite of the Shiketsu teacher. Hijack's brow furrowed. "Separation might be difficult. Are you certain Gigan agrees with this?"

At that, Inigo shifted uncomfortably, avoiding the mini dragon's worried eyes. "I'm sure it'll understand. It's for the best. I need to know more about my quirk if I’m gonna improve. It’s helped me get this far, but I wanna understand it more."

The teacher studied him intently. "Help me understand then. What brought this on so suddenly?"

Inigo chewed his lip. *Bad things are coming and I need to get stronger to protect everyone. If that’s too broad then - I want Gigan to form shields on all my friends 24/7. So no one ever gets hurt.* 

“I want to help my friends,” he said bluntly.

How could he explain his tangled motivations? He thought back to the start. Ever since manifesting Gigan, his worldview had been irrevocably shaped by the construct's presence. Its senses and instincts blended seamlessly with his own, especially now their bond was stronger. But that innate connection made it hard to distinguish where Inigo ended and Gigan began. Who was he without the dragon's moral compass steering him? Did he have any untainted memories at all? He needed to know.

"I guess..." he continued slowly. "Having Gigan with me all the time, I've never gotten the chance to just be myself. There's always this other entity influencing me, even if it's benevolent."

He looked at Gigan sadly. "Don't get me wrong, I appreciate everything you've done for me, buddy. But I need to know who I am. Does that make sense?" 

Gigan let out a mournful squeak but bobbed in understanding. Inigo gave it a grateful scratch behind its chin.

"And..." Inigo started, "My early memories feel foggy. It's possible Gigan has...shaded them positively. I want to recall things as they truly were."

Like that awful night with his brothers when Gigan's scales became crimson. Inigo pictured again the manor slick with blood. But even now the visceral horror he expected to resurface was muddled, softened by the buffer of Gigan's presence.

Hijack leaned back, steepling his fingers contemplatively. "Your reasoning seems sound. However, I must warn you - facing reality unchecked can be an intense experience, especially for one accustomed to a filter. It’s not well documented but studies have shown that quirk users with constructs and companions have them as part of their brain or personality. It would be like cutting off a part of your own brain."

Inigo nodded. "I know, but it's a risk I have to take. I need to do this."

His teacher held his resolute gaze a moment before standing. "Very well.  But only 24 hours separated. Return here tomorrow so I may restore your connection, sooner if you feel ill. Normally my quirk fades away when I stop concentrating, but you can choose to remain disconnected from Gigan."

Inigo exhaled in relief. "Thank you, Sensei."

He sat very still as Hijack placed a palm on his forehead. A faint pulse thrummed through his mind. Then suddenly, the ever-present weight of Gigan's consciousness lifted away. The absence left Inigo feeling hollow and dizzyingly alone.

"It’s done," Hijack confirmed. "How do you feel?"

"It's strange," Inigo replied. "Everything is quieter. I'm kinda cold and numb, but also anxious like I just drank three espressos." He stood up quickly. "I feel like running laps, doc."

"Likely that's your stamina balancing out. Increased caloric intake is a common trait for those who use their quirk actively, especially pro heroes. So normally you eat for two and your energy is split between you and your construct. You'll have to learn to balance that flow," Hijack said as he typed down on his tablet.

"By default it's 1:1. Gigan acts like a reservoir for you. This is why it's still able to function while you're unconscious and categorized as a permanent construct. When you activate your quirk, you pour your own energy into it. It's possible you can reverse that flow with practice or make the transfer process more efficient. This is all theory of course." 

Inigo heard Hijack's voice, but they seemed muffled. He took a deep breath and felt a thin layer of sweat  spreading across his palms. "Guess I'll skip dinner. That's good to know since Gigan was getting a little chubby."

"Anything else? Don't be scared now. I'm here." 

For a moment, Inigo felt a sharp pain across his temple, he glared at Hijack-sensei. No. Masanori Kitamura. Inigo had read his files. Some burnout underground hero was gonna tell him to not to be afraid? Please.

*Scared? You patronizing piece of shit. I came to you for help and now you're looking down on me. Who the hell do you think you're talking to? I know where you can shove your hats-* 

"You're trembling," Hijack pointed out.

Inigo looked down at his hands. He was shaking. Why was he so mad at his teacher just now? Fuck. That was too weird. He closed his eyes and flashes of violence scrolled through his head. Blood. Memories of middle school. He had beaten the other students. The teachers too. Kitamura reminded Inigo of this one substitute teacher. It wasn't his fault. They dared to defy him. In Luccione's words, they were disgusting hollow people. Not worth his time.

"I'm fine," Inigo stammered out. "I'm very sorry, sensei." He said sincerely, biting his tongue and bowing. He needed to apologize. He was ashamed of the thoughts streaming into his head. 

*That's not me. That can't be me.*

"Sorry for what," Hijack mused, not looking up from his tablet.

"For bothering you with this. Thanks for the help. I'll head out and get some fresh air."

"Very well. I have other matters to attend to but notify me immediately if you experience any concerning side effects. Your construct is still with you, but you’ll have to communicate with it vocally if you want to use your quirk."

“I should be alright on my own,” Inigo said, the red fog in his mind clearing. “I picked up something to put it in.” He pulled out a small red and white gacha capsule from the arcade. “Get in the ball, buddy.” 

Gigan looked up at Inigo with sadness in its large green eyes. It was feeling the separation too. With one last supportive mew, it shrunk down and Inigo caught it in the capsule. 

“I’ll be okay. I promise,” he whispered to the ball which shook twice in response.

Inigo stood on wobbly legs, already struggling to adjust. With a respectful bow, he thanked Hijack again and left the office, acutely aware of each footstep without Gigan's senses. Inigo wandered the school grounds aimlessly. The world around him felt muffled and mundane. Colors were duller shades bereft of Gigan's enhanced vision. Snatches of memories resurfaced, devoid of a rosy tint. The laughter he remembered sharing with Junichi and his classmates held a crueler undertone. His brother Satoru's smiles no longer seemed so warm and supportive.

###Chapter 2: Rooftop
Inigo bounded upstairs to the 1-D Hero course room, he found several classmates still gathered there: Noah, Sally, and Bobby were at the back of the room. Ashleigh stood by herself looking out the window as she gathered her things. Inigo froze in the doorway. Without Gigan's presence, interacting with people felt disorienting. He swallowed his frustration and forced a casual grin.

"Hey guys, what's up?" he greeted, hoping he sounded normal as he made his way to his desk to collect his schoolbag.

"Yo Inigo!" Bobby said. "We were just talking about Hijack's wild hats."

Noah nodded enthusiastically. "Yes, it was quite amusing! I especially enjoyed witnessing Sally embrace the honorable samurai spirit."

Sally reddened. "Y-yeah, I got too into it but that was Hifumi's fault!" She laughed self-consciously.

"It wasn't as bad as Noah's weird poem huh?" Bobby chuckled loudly.

Inigo joined in their laughter, but it sounded weirdly hollow to his ears. Stay cool, keep it together, he told himself. He noticed Ashleigh walking out in a huff.

"So what'd you think of hero training earlier?" The angel boy asked Inigo. "Noah thought it was quite intense."

Inigo shrugged, leaning against a desk. "It was alright. My squad totally dominated running up those walls!" He forced his usual cocky grin.

"You mean until you got crushed by Mitsurugi's team?" Sally pointed out with a smirk.

Inigo's eye twitched. "Yeah well...minor setback. Silver medal isn't that bad," he blustered. His classmates laughed and Inigo rubbed his neck grinning. 

He glanced at Noah's textbook. "So uh, you guys studying for the math exam?"

Bobby groaned, "Ugh don't remind me! I'm so not ready for that test."

"Perhaps we could have a study session this weekend?" Noah suggested kindly. "Many hands make light work, as they say."

Inigo mused, "Could be fun, I gotta get to studying myself."

Bobby grinned. "Count me in!"

Sally held up a finger, "You can even bring someone if you want. Plenty of room at the Abrams' house. Noah's place is wonderful."

Inigo blinked twice and then smirked, pointing an accusing finger at Sally. "And by someone - you mean you want me to bring Hoge huh?"

Sally glared, "N-no! Why would I care if you bring Ms. know-it-all!"

"So you can copy her worksheets and check her notes. I see your plan," he taunted. Though it was exactly what he planned to do as well.

"Well if she's gonna show up! She might as well give us the answers!"

{"Ya'll can copy my answers,"} Bobby offered. {"Took me awhile to make heads or tails of all the numbers, but it's all there."}

"Noah is grateful!"

"N-noah, nooo! Not his answers!" Sally panicked.

The spontaneous study group exploded into teasing and arguments. Inigo noticed Orochi rummaging through Yui's desk across the room. He excused himself and made his way to the white-haired girl.

"Hey Orochi, what's up?" Inigo asked, Orochi looked different since he last saw her presenting with Sandatsu a few hours back. There was a touch of sadness there and her hydra heads intimidated him, he had always thought they were cute but now they seem vicious and hungry. He tensed up reflexively.

"Oooh, hey Myoga!" Orochi replied brightly. "I was supposed to meet Yui so we could go to the arcade, but she's not responding to my texts. You haven't seen her have you?"

Inigo shook his head. "Nah, I just got back. I'll look around and let you know if I find her."

"Really? Thanks!" Orochi smiled. Inigo noticed the bandage around her wrist peeking out from under her sleeve.

"How're you feeling by the way? You know things weren't the same when you were in the hospital."

"Oh yeah, I'm much better now. Just a couple more check ups and I'll be good as new."

"That's awesome! We missed you around here. I know Yui was most worried of all."

"Aww, she was?" Orochi grinned. "Well in that case, I better go find her quick, maybe she already went to the arcade. See ya!" She ran out of the classroom. Inigo chuckled and grabbed his bag. 

***

He had a hunch where Yui might be hiding out. He made his way up to the roof. Inigo pushed open the rooftop door, and afternoon sunlight flashed across his vision. He saw Yui sitting alone near a ledge, gazing pensively at the horizon. Inigo climbed up a ladder and approached Yui cautiously. Her duo presentation came to mind. "Hey Shroom-head," he called out. "This spot taken, or are you saving it for Edith?"

Yui glanced up, eyes widening slightly before she schooled her features. "It's a free country," she muttered.

Inigo plopped down beside her. "No jokes about my presentation? Imai and I put a lot of effort in that. I must be losing my edge," he joked lightly.

Yui just shook her head, her gaze fixed on the distance. They sat in silence for awhile before Inigo spoke.

"Y'know, Orochi's looking for you."

"I know."

"You two get into a fight or something?" 

Yui seemed different too. Without Gigan, she looked more angry, more brutish with her wild hair and fangs, practically villainous. He bit his tongue. How could he think that. This was Yui. His first friend here. He pushed back his invasive thoughts, happy memories of their rescue classes, her cat Ako at the beach, and lazy afternoons at the Thanks a Latte filed in to replace them. He smiled.

"No...it's not her. I just can't be happy around her right now. Please don't tell her I'm here."

He placed his hands behind his head. "You came here to think huh? I get that."

"Do you ever feel like you had no choice?"

"What do you mean?"

Yui inhaled sharply. "Like your whole damn life was decided for you before you were even born. And you gotta play the crappy role you were given." She balled her hands into fists. "None of us asked to be here, right? This was just the most convienient path for some of us. There's no way to know being a hero would make us all happy. I'm sure for some of us it's the wrong choice." Her voice dripped with exhaustion.

"I guess." he said gently. "I haven't really thought much about the future. To tell you the truth I never wanted to be a hero," he turned towards her, "but this has been the best time of my life. There's been a lot of times when it's hard and scary, but I feel like it's worth it. Like compared to all the shit I've been through before, I honestly can't complain. And I feel like I don't have the right to question it. It's not perfect, but I wouldn't trade our class for the world."

"I kinda get that," Yui said quietly, struggling to keep her composure. Inigo hesitated, then carefully rested a hand on her shoulder. To his surprise, she didn't pull away. "So why did you join the hero course?" Yui asked, looking up.

"Eh.. you're gonna laugh at me," he said, shaking his head.

"What? C'mon!" 

"Okay! So I joined the hero course to pick up girls," Inigo admited, looking down.

"I knew it! I heard rumors you and Gigan are always doing perverted stuff!" Yui accused.

"Hey! I don't do that anymore!" Inigo said in defense, "I guess all I really wanted was someone to get close to. Also! Gigan doesn't do that stuff. It stops me from that if anything. Gigan's always leading me to do the right thing to the point that it's annoying. You're lucky you don't have a quirk that can talk."

Yui held out her hand and a single red thread spun out from her wrist, "Sometimes it does feel like my quirk can talk and guide me. Not like yours can, but like - it got me here."

"That's true.. Hey, what's with all the questions? You bummed about something?" 

"I have a lot of things on my mind. Y-you can get lost if you want!" Yui growled.

"Oho- I know!" Inigo smirked and reached for his phone. "Maybe this'll cheer you up." He scrolled through a list and handed her him phone. "I was monitoring the herotag Capture Cloth on Herogram during summer break. Check it out. You have fans, y'know! They even made fan art. There's this one confusing one with Noah, but don't worry about that." He pointed to comments talking about her prowess in the tournament. "Half of these are from the tournament, but there's even more fan messages from people you helped out in the beach and the summer festival."

Yui held the phone and read.

Inigo continued, "To be honest, I looked you up to see which of us was more popular. Guess I lost that one, but I'm coming up fast. I'm spreading bad rumors about you so I can be ahead."

"You asshole," she said as she punched his shoulder a little too hard. "I've never seen these before."

"Yeah there's a whole network of hero student fans out there. Most of them from our school. There's shockingly a lot of fans who are really into Ashleigh and some sort of sweep. I think Imai's been making multiple accounts, but I haven't confirmed it."

Yui handed him back his phone, "Thanks, not like I care if I'm popular or anything." 

Inigo took his phone back and shrugged, "Hey! That's what makes you cool!"

"What did Orochi want? Did she need anything?"

Inigo stood up, "Pretty sure she wanted to hit the arcade, but I can tell her you're not feeling it today."

Yui rolled her eyes but couldn't suppress a small chuckle. "...I guess I could use a few rounds of Street Brawler."

She allowed Inigo to help her to her feet. For a moment they both stood there wordlessly, just staring at the sky. Yui struck him on the shoulder before walking away.

"Ow! Hey what was that for?" Inigo rubbed his arm. 

"For being annoying and not leaving me alone! See ya!" Yui yelled as she left the roof.

Inigo grinned. He hoped Yui was okay. At least now he knew he's still a reliable friend even without Gigan. The friendships he made here were real. He heard his burner phone buzzing. Frowning, he looked at an alert telling him to come to his Uncle's hideout.

and in a flash, take you far away —
such that when you rise
it won’t be you that wakes
but a shadow self - Matsuo Daiichi, 850](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/41/fe/16/41fe160790a3bbed075396826868fc0a.jpg) <-

###Chapter 3: The Dragon
Inigo walked into the Yakuza  building, the familiar insignia of the Dai Ichi Kai - a dragon curling around a chrysanthemum - adorning the wall of the first room. He was recognized immediately by the men milling about. They bowed respectfully as he passed, though he noticed many sported injuries amongst the new hires.

He approached one of his uncle's men, a young man three years older than him named Hideki, who was sporting a black eye and split lip. "What happened here?" Inigo asked with concern.

Hideki sighed, "Got into a scrap with the Tendo clan over turf down by the docks. Bastards came at us while we were making collections."

Inigo shook his head, "Why're we fighting another Family's gang? We're all part of the same syndicate."

"They've been trying to muscle in on our territory for months. This time they brought pipes and chains." Hideki spat blood. "They got the jump on us this time, but we'll teach them their place."

"There'll be no retaliation until my uncle gets back. I'll talk to my elder brother about the Tendo clan. "

"Thank you," Hideki bowed his head. "I'll pass word to the others."

Inigo proceeded further into the building, dragon statues and tapestries marking his family's reign watching him pass. He felt uneasy without Gigan. At last, he reached the main hall, where a burly, tattooed man with four arms sat at a table, meticulously counting the month's profits, no doubt carving out his own personal slice.  This was Gorou, his uncle's second-in-command and the current leader.

"Daichi-sama, good to finally see you," Gorou greeted without looking up from counting bills. "How gracious of you to respond to our calls." His voice bordered on mockery. 

"I can't stay long. I'm here to discuss my uncle's trial," Inigo said flatly. "Where is he? And what's happened to the Five?"

Gorou didn't look up, merely shrugging. "Your uncle's trial is still ongoing, but I heard the bastard's gonna survive. As for the Five, they have been...reassigned. I wouldn't worry yourself over it."

Inigo frowned, the infamous band of mercenaries had practically been an extension of his uncle's will. Their sudden disappearance was troubling, especially since the incident with Christopher and Kaylee.

Before he could press the issue, a sight in the corner caught his eye - by a dark leather couch laid a girl's body covered in bags of ice. Even in that state, Inigo could tell she was young, probably around University age. 

"Who is she? What the fuck happened?" He asked sharply.

Gorou snorted, "Some college junkie who OD'd on some new Chinese opiate that's been going around," He leered. "Ain't she a pretty little thing though?"

Inigo's hands curled into fists. "Why are we allowing drug shipments into our territory? You know the clan forbids it."

"Times changed, kid. We don't have the men to keep it out Kyoto."

"It's poison!" Inigo spat. "Look what it's done to her."

He approached the body, heart heavy at the sight of her pale, lifeless face. 

"Why is she here?" Inigo whispered.

"Her parents are some big shot corporate types," Gorou lit a cigarette casually. "Paid us good money to make her disappearance seem legit. We got fake passport, eyewitness accounts, hotel bookings, the works. Easier to pretend she's alive and ran off than admit their princess had a drug problem."

Revulsion simmered in Inigo's gut.  She couldn't have been long out of high school. Did she have friends wondering where she was? Family that would be shattered by her loss? Inigo yanked down one of the curtains and covered the naked corpse.

"We need to find out how the drugs are getting in." he commanded. 

Gorou shrugged again. "Rumor is there's a bent cop looking the other way during shipments and leaking confiscated drugs."

Inigo's jaw clenched. This had gone on long enough. "Handle the disputes with the Tendo clan. I'll look into this drug business myself. Look into finding an informant."

"For the right price you can get anything these days," Gorou sneered. "We might even make some money from the dead girl before we get rid of the body."

"I want her treated with respect. Find a better place to put her in, none of this open house bullshit," Inigo commanded.

"C'mon kiddo! She's dead." Gorou looked up at him and cackled mockingly. "Besides the boys love it." He gestured with two of his four arms to his bodyguards in the room. "Gives them something nice to look at."

Inigo grabbed Gorou by the throat and slammed him down onto the table, sending stacks of cash flying.

"You will show respect, or so help me..." he growled, squeezing tightly.

Gorou clawed at Inigo's hand, face purpling. "Your uncle...was right...you're soft..." he choked out.

With a roar, Inigo hurled him halfway across the room. Gorou crashed into the wall and slumped down with a pained grunt. His men started forward, but Inigo silenced them with a glare.

"Stay back! This snake deserves what's coming."

He stormed over to Gorou's prone form, hauling him up and dodging Gorou's punches, before delivering a vicious knee to the stomach. As Gorou doubled over wheezing, Inigo grabbed him by the hair and twisted his head to the side.

"Look at her!" He commanded, forcing Gorou to face the dead girl's body. 

Gorou grimaced, blood dripping from his mouth, even with four arms he couldn't loosen Inigo's grip, "Fuck... She's just...worthless trash."

With a snarl, Inigo slammed Gorou's head into the floor. "We don't profit off poisoned children.." He kicked Gorou in the ribs. "Where is your honor?"

Coughing weakly, Gorou bowed his head. "I'm only....dealing with what...your Uncle left me...." He gasped out and wheezed painfully. "...Please.."

Inigo's lip curled in disgust. Even now, Gorou didn't understand - there were some lines that shouldn't be crossed.

"Now," Inigo said coldly. "Tell me about the Five, or you won't be walking out of here today."

Sensing his seriousness, fear shook Gorou. "Okay, okay! I heard they were sent to Nagoya. I hear they were given strict orders not to interfere with the hero license exams. They're working with the Shie Hassaikai gang. I don't know the details!"

Inigo released Gorou in revulsion. So Satoru is interested in Nagoya, at least the Five was further away from Shiketsu.

He stood over Gorou's broken body in contempt. "You are right about one thing - I'm soft because I cling to notions of right and wrong. The code set by the Five Families. If I hear any of drug dealing happening under your watch. I'm taking your fingers." He nodded at the guards. "Get him out of my sight."

As Gorou was dragged away, Inigo turned on his heel, no longer able to stand being in that place with the dead girl's accusing eyes following him. She could've been any one of his classmates. A grasping sadness filled his chest. He had failed her, but he would not fail again. He stopped by Hideki on his way out. 

"Hideki, I want the girl brought back to her family. Make sure she's seen. Send flowers for her funeral."

He kept moving, not waiting for a reply to his order. Too long had he believed he could gently guide everything - now he saw the cancer with unfiltered eyes. Gigan had shielded him from the worst of it all, but he wasn't a little boy that needed coddling anymore. 

###Chapter 4: Hope
Inigo grabbed one of his stowed skateboard and burst out of the building, desperate to get away. The image of the corpse and Gorou's broken body haunted him as he sped through the streets. His hands trembled. Damn it. Did he go overboard? He let the anger get to him. And now he has to find out who's letting drug shipments through, on top of the two-page essay he needs to write. He picked the wrong week to quit Gigan. 

Taking a deep breath he put on his earbuds and to calm himself down with his mixtape. Talk of the Town by the Pretenders rang in his ears as he skated through the backstreets of Kyoto. Inigo kicked off, his skateboard rumbling beneath him as he carved through the urban jungle. He popped an ollie over a fire hydrant, ran through a busy street full of cars, then nosegrinded along a stair railing, sparks flying from his board. He bumped past an Oyster-headed man who was holding a birthday cake and several balloons. "Sorry bout that!" Inigo yelled through his music as the cake went splat on the sidewalk and the balloons flew up in the air. Inigo reveled in the feel of the wind whipping through his hair as he zipped and zigzagged down the busy sidewalk.

Spotting a parked cookie truck up ahead, Inigo crouched low and built up speed. At the last second, he grabbed the truck's side mirror and allowed himself to get pulled along, cruising effortlessly as if waterskiing behind a boat. Letting go, Inigo used a lamppost to slingshot himself into an alleyway. He kickflipped over a pile of boxes, scratching the nose of his board on the landing. With a final ollie off a stoop, Inigo soared over three trash cans stacked precariously. He landed clean and coasted the last stretch to his destination.

When he reached Valiant Park, Inigo abandoned his board and began scaling the side of a building, seeking distraction. The capsule on his belt shook twice. "I know, buddy. Things are just a lot easier when you can fly, but I'd rather be alone right now." As he climbed, the afternoon sun came out of gloomy September clouds and lit up the Kyoto cityscape. He stared off into the distance while perched atop a water tower. He still felt ill but at least he could breathe. Running around Kyoto with only half your brain was a dumb idea. It's not like he had much a mind to begin with. He placed his arms behind his head and laid back. His mind raced with confusing thoughts. He wondered if he could still catch Hijack and get his quirk restored today. All of this was useless.

Inigo was so lost in thought that he didn't notice the figure ascending the water tower below him. It wasn't until she was halfway up the rooftop that he noticed the familiar muting of sound; Hoge in her Maru costume was climbing up too. 

Crap. She wasn't scheduled to train tonight. Did she change it? Panic gripped Inigo. After what he's witnessed today, he couldn't face Hoge without Gigan's filter. How different would she be? How much of her was a lie? Worse, he didn't want her to see this moody angry side of him in case she changed her mind about him. Keeping his eyes averted, Inigo scrambled back down the fire escape and climbed down the opposite side. He broke into a run and went through several dark alleyways. Good. He'll text her later about it. It's time to go home, he hoped Junichi's wasn't ther- Ow!

Suddenly, Inigo felt a sharp pinch on his hand. Whirling around, he found Hoge standing there, her helmet in one hand and an annoyed look on her face.

Inigo panicked, quickly shutting his eyes before her quirk revealed her, "D-did you bite me!?"

"Baka. Why are you ignoring me?" she demanded.

"Etto, I'm doing training Hifumi thought me. It's blindfold fighting." he lied. "Guess I didn't see you there."

Hoge's voice came clearer. "Hmmp! I know you're lying to me," she said matter-of-factly. "Your eyes were open when I bit you. Now tell me what's going on." Inigo backed up until he felt a brick wall behind him. Trapped, he reluctantly opened his eyes. 

Even without Gigan's filter, Hoge was just...Hoge. The same girl he cared deeply for. With her here, it was like he was connected with Gigan again. The world bloomed a shade brighter and the familiar thumping in his chest came.

"Yeah, sorry," Inigo said quietly, his face slightly red. "I know I seem off. I got something done today." he stammered, averting his eyes from her questioning gaze. 

Hoge's expression softened with concern. She stepped forward and placed a gentle hand on his arm.

"What's going on?"

Inigo took a shaky breath, gathering his turbulent thoughts. "It's this experiment with Gigan. Hijack helped me disconnect from my quirk. Being disconnected from it...I feel like I'm going crazy," he admitted quietly. "My mind races all the time, jumping from thought to thought. I get irrationally angry over small things."

He slumped back against the wall, shoulders sagging.

"Without Gigan keeping me balanced, I can't seem to function right. Interacting with people is strange." Inigo looked down.

"Maybe I should call Hijack-sensei and end this early. I wanted to understand myself better, but I overdid it thinking I could handle 24 hours right off the bat."

Hoge reached up and flicked him on the forehead. 

"Ow! What was that for?"

"You're being too hard on yourself, Ini. This was always going to be difficult."

She tilted her head and looked at him like she was walking him through a math problem she already knew the answer to.

"Gigan is an integral part of you. Of course you feel off-balance without it. But you've made it this far already. Ending the experiment early won't teach you anything."

Inigo peered up at her. "You really think I can make it through the full day?"

Hoge nodded encouragingly and her matter-of-fact tone changed into diffidence. "Maybe - Gigan helps keep you in check, but you're.. still you. Compassionate, driven, earnest..." Her cheeks colored slightly. "You have an indomitable spirit."

Inigo blinked in surprise, touched by her faith in him.

"When it gets tough, remember why you started this," Hoge continued gently. "Learning about every part of yourself will only help you become an even better hero." She gave his shoulder a firm pat. "So no giving up yet! You still have hours of learning ahead of you."

Inigo grinned. No matter how unmoored he felt, Hoge's presence kept him anchored. With her by his side, he could probably do anything. "You're right!" he said, standing up straighter and grinning. "Giving up now would be the easy way out. I told Hijack I could handle 24 hours, so I'm going to see it through." He met Hoge's gaze, resolve burning in his eyes.

"Hey, can you do me a favor?" On impulse, he removed Gigan's containment capsule from his pocket. "Here, could you hold onto Gigan for me?" he asked. "I want to see if I can handle things solo for a bit. It's not exactly self-isolation when I can summon him anytime. Plus Gigs trusts you, it'll probably do whatever you say."

Hoge nodded, tucking the capsule away. Inigo squeezed her hand and stepped close. "Stay with me until sunset?" he murmured.

Hoge drew back reluctantly. "I can't. I've made last minute adjustments to my schedule. I'll send you a copy. I have fifteen minutes left on my training so I have to go, Ini."

Inigo let her hand go, trying to ignore the ache in his chest, "I get it. Training for the exam comes first. I'll just be here, alone and quirkless." He fell back  with a jesting smile melodramatically.

A sly smile spread across Hoge's face. "You lied to me before, Myoga," she purred, backing him against the wall once more. "Fufufu- I think you deserve punishment."

Inigo's pulse quickened as Hoge pressed close, her body flush with his. He raised a brow. "It's not gonna be like when you found out I was giving dance lessons to Curie-sempai right? I don't even know how you replaced my shoes with only the left ones."  

"No." She trailed a fingertip down his chest agonizingly slowly. Inigo and leaned in, he shuddered, expecting her soft lips to meet his... But at the last second, Hoge pulled away with a smirk. "This is punishment," she declared. "No kisses for lying." Inigo groaned in protest. "You're kidding! That's just cruel!"

Hoge silenced him by placing a finger to his lips. "Maybe next time you'll be truthful with me," she said airily. Turning on her heel, she sprinted off and effortlessly scaled the wall behind her, disappearing into her quirk without another word. Inigo slumped back against the wall, cursing under his breath. She was getting more powerful, the closer the exams got. Her skills were unmatched. Still Hoge...was still Hoge. He was relieved about that. 

Pushing off from the wall, Inigo continued into the street. After a few minutes his world began to dim again. How did he miss her already? He felt more alone now that even Gigan's capsule is gone. At least his anger was all gone too, replaced with a daze of unsatisfied yearning.

###Chapter 5: Music

Inigo wandered through the busy shopping district alone with his thoughts swirling. He kept his hands in his pocket as he passed by various novelty shops meant to appeal to groups of tourists. He didn't feel like going home to his place just yet, who knows which uninvited guests would be there. His run in with Hoge reminded him that he was basically the same except less tempered. 

When Christopher had copied his dragon quirk. Christopher's personality hadn't fundamentally changed - he just became more impulsive and emotional. The construct itself hadn't overtaken his mind, just intensified certain emotions and instincts already within him. So did that mean Inigo's true nature was angry and callous without Gigan's empathy tempering him? The thought left a bitter taste in his mouth.

Lost in his thoughts, Inigo almost didn't notice the lone figure sitting hunched on a bench up ahead. It was Imai. Inigo quickened his pace, taking in the shorter boy's slumped shoulders and downcast eyes.

"Yo partner, why the long face?" Inigo asked lightly as he approached.

Imai glanced up with a weak smile that didn't reach his eyes. "Hello, Myoga. Just resting for a moment." He reached into his ears and pulled out his earbuds.

Inigo plopped down beside him. "Figured I'd say hey after we did that kick-ass presentation. You all set on which duo you're doing an essay on?"

"Yes, of course." Imai straightened. "Apologies if I seem distracted. I have...personal matters on my mind."

Inigo followed his subtle glance toward a large group of tourist kids whispering nearby, pointing at Imai with taunting grins and mocking laughter. Inigo noticed the wide berth everyone seemed to give the three-eyed mutant boy.

"It's fine, if I wait a bit they'll leave and I don't have to walk through them," Imai said.

Anger sparked within Inigo. "Don't let those jerks get to you," he said fiercely. 

Imai blinked flatly, "I appreciate the sentiment. But I'm quite accustomed to such treatment."

“C’mon! We got this! Just copy me.” Inigo declared, standing abruptly. He grabbed Imai’s wrist and pushed towards the crowd, putting on his meanest face and delinquent stance. Inigo's other hand curled into a fist. 

“ORA! Who the HELL do you think you’re staring at you, little shits!? BAKA YAROU! Don't make me stomp ya! Get out of the way!” Inigo yelled, being especially careful not to step on any kids.

The children scattered as they passed, many of them crying as they rushed towards their chaperones.

“That’s….what I was trying to avoid,” Imai said disappointingly with a faint sigh as he stared at one of the panicking bullies.
 
"It’s better they learn early or they’ll just get worse. Trust me, I know from experience.” Inigo let go of Imai’s wrist as they cleared the tour groups. 

“That’s not always true,” Imai said, looking away.

 Inigo could tell Imai just wanted to move past the unpleasantness, so he decided to change the subject.

“What were you listening to back there?”

“Some old jazz. Lee Morgan,” Imai said casually with a bit more interest.

“No way! I have his album back home. I listened to him all Summer long.”

“That’s lucky. I only found this one track so far. It’s hard to find old music from before the hundred years of chaos.”

“Guess, you’re right. No wonder my family kept all that ancient stuff hidden,” Inigo pondered.

As they walked together, a shop at the end of the lane caught Inigo’s attention.

"Yo. You wanna go to that music store with me?"

Imai's expression brightened visibly. "Ah yes, Melody Lane."

"Great, c’mon! You can show me what they got!”

 Imai paused outside the entrance, suddenly self-conscious. "I've, uh, actually never been in here," he admitted.

Inigo gave him a small, reassuring smile. “Cool, the Dastardly Duo will explore together."

Imai nodded with amusement. Grinning, Inigo held the door open with an exaggerated bow. "After you, good sir!" Inigo felt better knowing he had company. Still, glancing at the quiet tri-clopsian boy he wondered what Imai was thinking.

**Imai POV**

The afternoon sun glints off the storefront windows as Inigo and I approach the music shop. Despite my reluctance, I allowed Myoga to drag me here after school. "Time After Time" by Cyndi Lauper filters out onto the street as Inigo pulls the door open. The overhead bells jingle, announcing our arrival. I hesitate at the threshold as nostalgia washes over me. How long has it been since I last set foot in a music store?

As a child, I would wander through shops like this with my mother, pondering which new CD to add to my modest collection. Nowadays, digital downloads have made these outings obsolete. Yet standing here surrounded by records, I'm reminded of simpler times.

Inigo darts towards the rock section, his gaze hungry like a kid in a candy store. I drift towards the classical music selection, letting my fingers trail delicately across the CD spines. My eyes scan the titles, searching for a rare find or forgotten gem. Back in middle school, I prided myself on having the most obscure taste in music. These days, I hardly have anyone to impress with my eclectic preferences. 

Truthfully, I haven't kept up much with new music lately. My playlists remain populated by the same artists I discovered during my isolated middle school years. Not to say, I haven't enjoyed some new songs through Katsuragi's anime-centric musical taste. Music was a refuge, transporting me from the long empty hours after school. The headphones created a barrier keeping the outside world at bay. After manifesting my quirk, I became fearful of getting close to others. The music wrapped me in a cocoon of sound where my differences didn't matter.

I pick up a vinyl copy of Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata. I haven't heard this one in awhile. A brassy jazz tune suddenly erupts from my pocket, jolting me from my recollections. I fumble to retrieve my still-ringing phone, the lively jazz notes seeming out of place amidst the mothballed classics.

"Moanin' by Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers," an excited voice states. I turn to see that Inigo has materialized beside me, staring at my phone screen. "Love that ringtone!"

I suppress a sigh, accepting the call from my mother. Our conversation is brief as I inform her of my whereabouts and late arrival home. Hanging up, I glance sheepishly at Inigo, who is still hovering. "You like him too?" I ask, unable to mask my surprise.

"Are you kidding? It's one of my favorites! Check it out!" Inigo responds enthusiastically. Before I can reply, he is steering me towards the jazz section, already pulling out records and providing eager commentary.

I listen with quiet curiosity as Inigo gestures animatedly, expounding on release years and session musicians. This passionate expertise is wholly unexpected from the boisterous boy I pegged as a Top 40 follower. Yet Inigo speaks about chord changes and improvisation with the ease of a seasoned enthusiast. Perhaps I misjudged him.

"Growing up, I kinda got stuck in a big and empty house," Inigo explains, his tone growing somber. "Everyone was always busy with the family business, so I spent a lot of time alone."

He traces a finger over a classic jazz album cover, eyes distant. "One day when I was exploring, I found this old room full of vinyl records and movie reels that belonged to my grandfather. It was like discovering a treasure room."

Inigo's face lights up, reliving the memory. "I started playing those old records on the antique turntable in there. Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong. It was all pretty new to me but felt familiar too, you know?"

I nod in understanding. 

"After that, I got hooked on jazz and started collecting records. The old films were cool too. I'd watch Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn while jamming to Miles Davis or John Coltrane. It wasn’t too bad until I got out of Ishikawa and found out the internet exists."

Though Inigo recounts this brightly, I detect the melancholy underlying his words. “I get it. I had the same experience. I saved up for my first music player when I was five. There is a timeless quality to those old jazz legends. ”

"That's cool. Oh man, we gotta listen to this one!" Inigo suddenly declares, brandishing a John Coltrane album. I open my mouth to protest, but Inigo is already dragging me into the shop's listening booth, his grip surprisingly strong.

>Recommended music: https://youtu.be/R_f_mMJAezM?si=d7NUMFsOylWdXMZg

As the velvety saxophone notes swirl around us, I feel my body involuntarily relaxing. I close my eyes, absorbing the sensuous harmonies and angular rhythms. Beside me, Inigo bobs his head enthusiastically in time with the pulsating drums.

"Not bad, right?" he remarks during a drum solo, flashing me a grin. I nod slowly, the trace of a smile tugging at my lips despite myself. Inigo's zeal is almost infectious.

Over the next hour, we make our way through a random assortment of albums plucked excitedly from the stacks by Inigo. As the final mournful notes of "Goodbye Pork Pie Hat" ring out, I'm struck by a realization. I've actually been enjoying myself here in this booth.

“Hey Imai, can I ask you something?”

I nod for him to continue.

“Why aren’t we friends?”

I halt mid-album switch, blinking at him. “What?”

Inigo shrugs, shoving his hands in his pockets. “I mean, you seem like a cool guy. And we clearly dig the same tunes. So how come we’ve never really hung out before?”

I stare at him, caught off guard by the query. In truth, I’ve kept my distance from most classmates, interacting only as needed. This listening session with Inigo is the longest I’ve socialized with him so far.

I weigh how to respond, discomfited by his forwardness. Sensing my hesitation, Inigo tilts his head. “Sorry if that was weird to ask. Forget it.”

“No, it’s...a fair question,” I reply slowly.

Inigo perks back up. “Yeah?”

I try to gather my thoughts. “I suppose...I’m just not the most outgoing person. Making new friends has never come naturally to me.”

It sounds like a weak excuse, yet it’s the most benign way to explain my inherent guardedness. 

“Huh, me neither!” Inigo declares. I shoot him a skeptical look and he laughs.

“Okay, maybe I come off super social. But big groups could wear me out too. Right now, especially.” He smiles self-consciously and looks away. “I’m kinda going through something, so I wanted to make a friend to see if I still can.”

I’m touched by the odd admission. Does Inigo hides his own shyness behind boisterous bravado? Yet he still tries to connect. Unlike me, isolating myself as problems arise. I take a breath. “I have been closed off since starting at Shiketsu.”

Inigo nods encouragement, sensing my difficulty voicing this.

“I suppose...I worry about letting people get close,” I continue haltingly. “Then feeling like I have to hide part of myself from them. It’s easier to just keep my distance.” There. I alluded to it without explicitly naming my quirk. Inigo doesn’t push for more details.

“Yeah, I get that,” he says. “But maybe there are people you wouldn’t have to hide from.”

I ponder this, hesitant to hope. Would Inigo still seek my friendship if he knew about Mindbreaker? He shoots me a knowing wink and looks out the booth. 

“I’m gonna ask how much this cost. You wanna go half in with me?” He holds up a Horace Silver Quintet album and I nod in response.

**Inigo POV**

Inigo sauntered up to the counter, vintage jazz record in hand. “What’s the damage for this beauty?” he asked the cashier.

The woman glanced up from her magazine, her expression vacant. “5,000 yen,” she droned. Inigo grimaced. He was strapped for cash this month. As he went back to Imai, Inigo looked through a mirror and noticed the cashier remained frozen like a statue. “Hey, I think something’s up with her,” Inigo muttered to Imai. “Can you peek into her head?”

Imai shifted, conflicted. “Invading privacy isn’t right.”

“I know,” Inigo insisted. “But she’s acting weird.”

Imai shook his head. “Let’s just go,” he said firmly.

“Imai… she could be in trouble. Isn’t it strange that she hasn’t moved since we got here? She's also pale as fuck. C'mon bro.”

With an irritated sigh, Imai subtly activated his quirk. After a moment, his face visibly tensed. “There’s a man with a gun in the backroom. Her husband's held hostage,” Imai whispered. “She’s being watched through the security camera. She’s waiting close up after we leave.”

Inigo cracked his knuckles. “Let’s go then. But we’ll be back through the side door.”

They exited the shop and snuck down the alley to a grimy window. Inigo jimmied it open and they slipped inside, finding themselves in a cluttered storage closet. 

“I don’t know about this. We should contact the law enforcement,” Imai whispered.

“It could be too late by then,” Inigo said, crouching towards the corner.

They crept down the hall until muffled shouts became audible. Pressing their ears to the door, the boys made out a reedy voice issuing threats. 


Suddenly, a cry of pain rang out, followed by a sharp smack.

({He’s distracted. On my mark.}) Inigo heard Imai’s voice in his head.

Inigo nodded back.


({Now!})


Together, they threw their shoulders against the door. It burst open and they tumbled inside. Two hostages were tied up inside. A thin, greasy-haired man in a leather jacket whirled to face them, brandishing a pistol.

“Drop it, creep!” Imai commanded. The man’s hand spasmed open under Imai’s mental control. Inigo tackled him before he could recover. They crashed to the floor, the gun skidding away. Inigo wailed on the man.

Suddenly, a shockwave of energy pulsed from the man, blasting Inigo and Imai backwards. The man leapt up, blood dripping from his nose.

“You kids wanna play hero?!” he shrieked. He slammed his fists together, unleashing another concussive blast.

Inigo and Imai dove behind a shelving unit just before the shockwave obliterated it. The man cackled, drunk on his own power. Inigo peeked out and rolled aside as another shockwave demolished the spot he’d been.

“We gotta get closer!” Inigo yelled over the destruction.

Imai nodded. “I’ll distract him - you take him down!”

Imai came out of the corner to look at the man directly and the man screamed in pain and grabbed his head. “Stay out of my head, freak!” A concussive blast sent the tri-clops teen flying into a stack of boxes.


Inigo charged out, leaping into a backflip to evade another blast. As the man focused his attack on Inigo, Imai crept out from under the boxes and cause the man’s leg to twist down. Timing it perfectly, Inigo tackled the man’s legs just as he powered up again.

They crashed down in a tangled mess of limbs. Inigo pounced, pinning the man’s arms. Their opponent thrashed and flailed.

“Get off me, you motherfucker!”

Inigo brought his knee into the man’s gut and rolled with him. “Shut it! You ruined a perfectly good date, bro. The cops are taking you away!”

The man just cackled maniacally. “By the time they get here, I’ll have pulverized you!”

To Inigo’s shock, the man began straining against his hold, inch by inch wrenching one arm free. Inigo desperately tried to subdue him, but his skinny frame hid freakish strength.

With a burst of power, the man freed an arm and clamped it over Inigo’s face. Inigo’s head was smashed against the hard floor, stars bursting across his vision.

“Imai...do something!” Inigo grunted, struggling to restrain the man as his concussive power built.

Desperate, Imai scrambled for the discarded pistol. He pressed the gun to the man’s temple. “Stop, or I’ll shoot!”

The man just cackled. “You don’t have the guts!”

Steely-eyed, Imai thumbed back the hammer. “Try me.”

Their opponent glanced at Imai. Imai’s quirk flared inside the man’s head telling him to surrender. With a growl, the man stopped resisting.

Inigo ran his fingers through his hair and sighed in relief. “Nice work, partner.”

###Chapter 6: A Song


Soon the police arrived to arrest the villain, and the store owners were questioned while the two boys hid in the back. The owners had agreed to keep their involvement a secret since neither of them had a hero license yet.

“That was crazy..” Imai said worriedly, still holding the gun. “I can’t believe we took that guy down. I almost shot him.” Inigo clapped his back. “We make a good team! Couldn’t have done it without you. Oh and-” He grinned and pointed at the gun. “The safety’s still on. You couldn’t have shot him if you tried.”

Imai smiled. “It worked didn’t it?”

“Yeah, it did! It’s a victory for the Dastardly Duo! Next time I’ll bring my vampire cape,” Inigo grinned and shot him finger guns.

***

After the police left with the robber, the shopkeeper approached Inigo and Imai with a grateful smile. "I can't thank you enough for saving my store," he said warmly while bowing. "I’m Mr. Kujo and this is my wife, Reo. Please, let me show you my appreciation."

Inigo spoke out, “Don’t worry about it, Kujo-san. I’m Myoga Inigo and this is Soujyuuro. We’re hero students so it’s kinda our job.”

“Please there must be something.”

“Well, you can give us a discount on a record,” Inigo grinned. “That’ll make us even.”

“Please, choose any record you want!” Kujo-san said eagerly.

Inigo and Imai smiled and picked out the record they tried to purchase earlier.

“Here you go,” Imai said, handing the record to Mr. Kujo.

Kujo-san shook his head. “I’m afraid, this is record is different from the others. You need a specific music player to play this. You see the blue lines at the edge. This uses an inverted player.”

Inigo’s nodded. “Naruhodo. I really wanted to listen to this one.”

“That’s too bad,” Imai shrugged. “We’ll just pick another one.”

“But if you’d like to listen, I do have the music player in our studio room.”

Inigo perked up, “Really? Can we?”

Kujo-san smiled. “Yes, of course follow me.”

He led them to a basement room filled with a variety of musical instruments. Inigo's eyes lit up at the impressive collection of drums, guitars, brass and woodwinds.

"Whoa, cool! You've got a lot of stuff back here," Inigo remarked, gravitating toward the shiny drum set.

The shopkeeper beamed. "I used to play in a band when I was younger. Feel free to try anything you'd like. I'll be upstairs cleaning up."

Inigo started browsing the dusty room, he drifted towards a shiny drum set as if drawn by an invisible force. He ran a gentle hand over the snare drum, feeling the tension of the taut skin.

"Found something you like?"

Inigo turned to see Imai had wandered over, a polite smile on his face. Inigo rubbed the back of his neck. "Ah yeah, I used to play a bit," he admitted. "Helped me blow off steam back in the old farm. Doubt I could still keep a beat."

"I'm sure muscle memory remains. Please, give it a try." Imai gestured invitingly to the drum set.

After a hesitant pause, Inigo settled onto the stool and picked up the sticks. He bounced them experimentally on the snare a few times, then launched into a lively beat, keeping things simple. The familiar motions came rushing back.

Inigo glanced up to see Imai watching him, head tilted appraisingly. They gazed into each others eyes for a moment.

"Impressive. Your rhythm is quite steady for being out of practice."

Inigo laughed self-consciously. "It's just basic stuff. What about you? Play anything?"

Imai's gaze drifted over Inigo's shoulder. Inigo turned to follow his line of sight, spotting a polished grand piano tucked away near the room's back wall.

Comprehension dawned on Inigo's face. "No way, you play piano?"

Pink tinged Imai's cheeks at being so easily read. "Just a bit of classical pieces. Nothing like your skill."

Inigo hopped up eagerly. "Bro, I gotta hear you go! C'mon." He grabbed the surprised boy's arm and steered him over to the elegant instrument.

After another shy pause, Imai took a seat at the bench. He took a settling breath before placing his hands delicately atop the keys. Then the shop filled with the heart-wrenching melody of Chopin's Nocturne No. 2 in E Flat Major.

Inigo sank onto a nearby chair. Imai's slender fingers danced across the keyboard with grace and emotion, bringing the complex piece to tender life.

When the last poignant note faded away, Inigo let out a low whistle.

"Imai, that was insane! You totally killed that."

Imai ducked his head, appearing simultaneously pleased and flustered by the effusive praise.

"You flatter me. It is merely one of my favorite pieces to practice."

Inigo leaned forward eagerly in his seat. "But for real, you gotta keep going! What else can you play?"

At Inigo's infectious enthusiasm, Imai transitioned fluidly into Debussy's enchanting Clair de Lune. The sweet notes rippled through the shop like moonlight on water. Inigo closed his eyes, fully immersed in blissful listening. But soon an idea struck, and he grabbed the drumsticks resting nearby. Moving quietly so as not to disturb Imai's playing, Inigo settled back at the drum set. Then he began to accompany Clair de Lune with soft, syncopated percussion. Imai glanced over in surprise but didn't miss a single note. Buoyed by Inigo's delicate rhythms, the atmosphere between them shifted. A spark was kindled, igniting the air with creative energy. Almost unconsciously, Imai's playing became infused with a new liveliness, while Inigo responded in turn by picking up the pace.

Their musical conversation continued as one song organically transitioned into the next. They moved through free-form jazz that Inigo initiated, with Imai nimbly improvising embellishments. At last they concluded on a resounding crash of cymbals, grinning at each other breathlessly across the space between piano and drums.

Inigo let out an exhilarated whoop. "Dude, that was awesome! We gotta write that song down."

Imai smiled, relaxed in a way he hadn't been before. "Yeah." He picked up an empty music sheet. "What should we name it?"

Inigo smirked, "How bout the Dastardly Duo's 1st Song!"

Imai shook his head, "That's a terrible title."

"Hey it's a work in progress! Plus we still gotta finish writing it." He looked through a stack of music sheets. "Let's see if I can find a pencil. Oh wow! Hang on, bro. Do you know this one?" He held up a music sheet and Imai nodded.

"I believe so."

"It's Peace Sign."

Expertly, both boys started to play, each one picking up the other's pace. Their initial tentativeness was shed, replaced by instinctive interplay honed by years of solitary practice.

As they played, Inigo heard an anime song coming from Imai's phone. Without missing a beat Imai turned his phone off with his left hand and continued playing. Inigo frowned.

"So what's the deal with you and Ashleigh?" he asked loudly over the music. "You two have been off lately."

Imai's played on. "We had a disagreement about my quirk. She doesn't get it."

"About how you use it? Or don't use it?"

"I haven't used it in weeks. Katsuragi thinks she knows better."

"Hey man, fighting over stuff like that sucks, but you can't avoid the topic forever."

Imai glowered, his playing turning discordant and harsh. "I don't want to talk about it."

"There you go, holding back again. You know we've been classmates for half a year now and I barely know anything about you until today!"

"I like to keep private. There's nothing wrong with that."

"How come you're not part of any music club? When it's clear you love music!"

"I'm too busy."

"I don't buy it. This whole thing with Ash. Is it about Mio and her quirk?" Inigo picked up tempo on the drums.

"...." 

"I did a background check and I read the letter Chris gave to Gigan. I know about Mindbreaker. Why do you hide it?"

"It's hard... living with a quirk like mine, especially once people know what I could do," Imai called out as he played, picking up his tempo as if they were racing.

"You think it's easy for all of us?" Inigo yelled. "We've all got our demons, powers or not! That's why you gotta let us in, bro!"

"I...don't know if I can," Imai admitted as his fingers blazed through the keys. 

Inigo smashed the cymbal loudly. "You can't be scared of your quirk. Don't you trust yourself, Imai?"

"I trust myself. It’s the world who looks at me differently. I can’t be fearless like you."

"I’m scared all the time. It sucks when I fail but you don't get anywhere being passive. If you hadn’t gone after Mio, you wouldn’t be where you are with Ashleigh now. Who knows how many others Mio might’ve hurt. I had high hopes for you! And then you just stopped!"

"I knew it! I shouldn't have come here with you. This was a mistake. You're always inserting yourself where you don't belong. Do me a favor and mind your own business, Myoga! And stay away from me."

Inigo glared, shakily. "You make me sick. I never liked you Imai. You get on my nerves! Standing separate, thinking you’re doing us a favor by not using your quirk’s potential."

Imai slammed the piano keys furiously. "You have no idea the tightrope I have to walk because of my power!" he shouted over the music. "I can't afford mistakes like you! If I don't stay in control, my mother will never trust me. I can't lose her....she's been through enough."

"Today, when the store owner looked at us. She was scared wasn’t she? We saved them using **your** quirk. If I hadn't been around, you would’ve ignored her." Inigo felt his anger building.

"That’s not always the case....."

"Then when is it the case!?"

"...."

"Are you waiting for another Mio to pop up in plain sight? How long was she hidden because you wouldn't open your three dumb eyes?!"

"FUCK OFF!  I DON’T KNOW! OKAY!? WHAT THE HELL DO YOU KNOW ABOUT ME HUH? I DON’T KNOW WHAT IM DOING! I JUST STRUGGLE IN VAIN LIKE AN IDIOT! I DONT HAVE ANY CLOSE FRIENDS LIKE YOU! AND - AND NOW ASHLEIGH MIGHT BE GONE TOO! LIKE IT OR NOT IM STUCK WITH THIS QUIRK - WITH THIS EYE - AND PEOPLE WILL ALWAYS LOOK AT ME DIFFERENTLY LIKE I'M A VILLAIN! I HATE IT! MY MOTHER IS ALL I HAVE! I HAVE TO SHOW HER THAT I'M NOT LIKE FATHER! I DON'T NEED A LESSON FROM YOU! WITH YOUR DRAGON QUIRK! WHO’S MEANT FOR A HERO!"

"SCREW YOU IMAI! I HATE MY DAMN QUIRK TOO. I HATE IT! I HATE HOW IT FILTERS MY MIND, HOW IT MAKES ME QUESTION EVERYTHING. HOW IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE I DON'T DESERVE WHERE I AM… MY QUIRK IS ALL I AM TO PEOPLE. IT'S THE ONLY REASON MY FAMILY WANTS ME. IT'S THE ONLY REASON WHY I'M IN THIS SCHOOL. I DON'T GET GOOD GRADES LIKE THE OTHERS. I'M NOT BATTLE HUNGRY OR A GYM NUT! I'M JUST A BOY WHO LUCKED OUT AND GOT A ONE IN A MILLION QUIRK. I DON'T DESERVE TO BE IN 1-D. BEFORE I CAME HERE I WAS NOTHING. "

"..."

"..."

They glared bitterly at each others with tearful eyes still continuing to play.

Imai spoke out first, "Then you’re wrong… cause I’ve seen what you do… the way you help others. You deserve to be in the hero course."

"So do you... and at your full potential, Imai. You don't have to hide. Your mom's not the only one you have. Ashleigh, Chris, Hoge, me! Everyone in 1-D has your back bro. You can try counting on us, but you can't sit back and keep us out... I'm dragging you along whether you want to or not."

Their eyes slowly met in understanding as they played. There was still much left unsaid between them. But the bridge of music had been crossed, bringing their divergent souls a bit closer.

The sun was starting to set as the impromptu jam session continued, casting an amber glow over the music room. As he wailed on the cymbals, Inigo felt lingering irritation wash away, leaving him energized yet serene. Glancing over, he could see a similar sense of catharsis on Imai's face as his fingers flew across the keys, unleashing cascades of haunting notes.

Their playing was far from perfectly harmonious, still erratic and discordant in places. But those imperfections lent the performance an organic spontaneity, like a living conversation between their hearts. Without needing to discuss it aloud, the song organically shifted, giving way to slower tempos and softer tones. The anger that had fueled their playing earlier was spent, leaving behind a residual sense of peace.

As the final notes rang out, Inigo knew the barriers between them were lower, if only by a few bricks removed.

"Hey...we should do this more often," Inigo said, twirling his drumstick lazily. "I gotta admit, I dig your moody piano."

The corner of Imai's mouth quirked upward. "You're not too bad yourself."

"It's late and we should go, but do you wanna jam again tomorrow? We can finish writing the song."

"Yeah. You're on. If you promise not to start crying mid song."

Inigo gasped in mock offense before breaking into laughter. Imai's reserved chuckle soon joined in. The last rays of sunset streamed through the music room windows as the two unlikely friends left together, the lingering strains of melody trailing behind them. Their song was far from over, but this jam session had brought them a little closer in tune.

###Chapter 7: Closure
>Recommended music: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNlzwyFxCoY

Inigo took a deep breath as he sat across from Hijack-sensei in the familiar office. After 24 chaotic hours, it was finally time to reconnect with Gigan.

"How are you feeling, Myoga?" Hijack asked, studying him intently. "You look more centered than yesterday. I trust you found this experience enlightening?"

Inigo nodded slowly and smirked, "Yeah you can say that, it was pretty wild. I learned a lot about myself and my quirk." He absently rolled Gigan's capsule between his palms. "Being without Gigan, it was like half my brain was missing. I felt so alone and angry all the time. At first, I wondered if that meant my true self is just an angry jerk without Gigan's influence. But the more I thought about it..."

He trailed off, searching for the right words. "Gigan isn't some separate entity that lives in my head. It's as much a part of me as my arms or legs. Just, you know, a part of my brain."

Inigo smiled down at the capsule. "Gigan helps with my empathy, my compassion. Aspects of myself that I need to work on. I was so focused on finding my 'true' self without it that I didn't get that it already is me." He looked up at Hijack-sensei. "Gigan and I are two parts of one whole. I think I get that now."

Hijack smiled, leaning back in his chair. "Well said. I'm glad to hear you've gained greater self-understanding from this experience." He steepled his fingers contemplatively. "Our quirks shapes who we are in ways we don't always realize. Being a hero means accepting every part of oneself, even those influenced by our powers."

Inigo nodded, "I still have more to learn about my quirk. But Gigan isn't something I should try to eliminate. Going forward, I want to nurture that part of myself, not reject it."

Hijack placed a steadying hand on Inigo's shoulder. "You've impressed me with your maturity, Myoga. Are you ready?"

At Inigo's determined nod, Hijack placed his palm against Inigo's forehead once more. A familiar thrum reverberated through his mind. Then like a missing puzzle piece clicking into place, the comforting weight of Gigan's presence settled back within him.

Inigo exhaled slowly, warmth and clarity rushing back in. He glanced down to see Gigan materializing on his shoulder, nuzzling against his cheek with a happy squeak. Inigo's heart swelled.

"I missed you too, buddy," he murmured, giving the mini dragon an affectionate hug. Gigan looked up at Inigo with its large white eyes and lifted up one of its claws.

Inigo raised a brow and felt a low buzzing in his head. Focusing on the noise, he flared his quirk and felt the world dim, like when he was seperated from his construct. "Huh?"

Gigan mewed and floated in mid-air in front of him. *I see. You're trusting me to see with my own eyes if I want to? Thanks buddy, but I'd rather we stick together for now, okay?* Inigo called on his quirk again and the world grew brighter. Gigan squeaked and landed on his right shoulder, nuzzling him affectionally.

"Interesting development," Hijack said, noting the change through his quirk.

"Is that normal, sensei?"

"Not typically, so be careful."

He looked back at Hijack. "Thank you, Sensei. I know disconnecting construct users can be risky."

Hijack waved it off. "You demonstrated responsibility by limiting it to 24 hours. Just promise me no elaborate experiments without supervision." He gave Inigo a knowing look.

Inigo laughed, rubbing his neck. "You got it."

After a final grateful bow, Inigo exited the office with Gigan perched contently on his shoulder once more. Making his way down the hall, Inigo felt more whole than he had in days. With Gigan by his side, the world seemed to regain its color and music. Stepping outside into the afternoon sunlight, Inigo spotted two familiar figures standing by the school gates up ahead. A grin spread across his face.

It was Imai and Ashleigh. The two were speaking intently, Ashleigh's eyes downcast while Imai gestured emphatically. Then Ashleigh looked up, nodding as a shy smile graced her lips. Imai's shoulders relaxed as he pulled something from his pocket - a flash drive. Ashleigh accepted it graciously before pulling Imai into a sudden hug. Imai tensed in surprise before gingerly returning the embrace. Inigo chuckled under his breath. It seemed the moody musician had finally opened up. He was happy for Imai. Beneath that stoic facade, the guy had a lot of love to give once you cracked through. Now if he could just find his own muse he'd be ready to play.

A figure suddenly materialized beside Inigo, startling him from his thoughts. Speak of the devil - it was Hoge.

"Skipping soccer practice again?" she asked, one brow raised.

Inigo grinned sheepishly. "Yeah, but I got a good reason this time."

He nodded toward the reconciled couple. Hoge followed his gaze, comprehension dawning on her face as she took in Ashleigh and Imai's tender moment.

"I see. Well, I'm glad they worked it out." A small smile turned up the corner of her mouth.

Inigo's heart swelled looking at her. On impulse, he pulled Hoge into a hug.

"Uwha-?!" Hoge stiffened, caught off guard. Inigo just chuckled.

"Thanks for everything, Hoge," he said sincerely. "You really came through for me yesterday."

Hoge glanced away, cheeks pink "Hmph. Well, someone has to look after you." But she gently returned the hug before stepping back.

Nodding toward her camera bag, Inigo asked, "Off to photography club?"

"Yes. I'm taking candid shots of people today," Hoge affirmed. 

Just then, a voice called out. "Hey Myoga! You ready or what?"

Inigo turned to see Imai walking towards them from the gates, Ashleigh beside him.

"You bet!" Inigo called back with a grin. He waved to Hoge. "See you later!"

With Gigan fluttering behind him, Inigo jogged off to join Imai. The two boys laughed and chatted animatedly as they headed into town together.

Behind them, Ashleigh and Hoge watched their respective partners depart.

"Huh. Since when did those two get so chummy?" Ashleigh wondered aloud. "I'm a little jealous."

Hoge just shrugged, a bemused smile on her lips. She turned towards Ashleigh with her camera held up. "Katsuragi-san, I want to take photos of you."

Ashleigh looked unsure, "Oh, umm...okay." 

The two girls went their own way as Inigo and Imai made their way towards the music store.

Inigo grinned, "Bro! I got a bunch of ideas.. Picture this: you do a killer piano solo! We go into the bridge and then we hit them with this key change,  Bam! It'll catch them off guard, but in a good way."

Imai rubbed his chin, "Hmm. I was thinking we slow things down a bit, maybe strip it down to just bass and acoustic guitar before the chorus."

"Eh, bass and guitar? We're gonna need other members."

"I supposed so. Do you know anyone, Myoga?"

"I'm glad you asked!"

The two boys fell into relaxed conversation as the Dastardly Duo walked the sun setting behind them. Though there were still challenges ahead, bonds had been strengthened and connections reforged. For now, the future seemed bright for the two young hero students.
