## FAQ
### What is Limbus Company?
Ligma Company is a game developed by Project Type-Moon, developers of Colonoscopy Corporation and Legend of Ruinia. It's about reimagined literary characters living in a dystopian hellhole called ~~South Korea~~ The City, hired by the titular Sugma Company to scour the ruins in search of Golden Boughs for an as of yet unspecified goal, while driving a bus that runs on human lives.

### Do I need to play the previous two games?
The sweaty lorefags in the threads are going to tell you otherwise, but no. Dante (also known as literally you) has no knowledge of what happened in the previous two games. The setting is explained to newcomers in the introductory chapters. There are also barely any spoilers to the first two games in the first 3 chapters, so you can just feel free to jump straight into Limbus.

**However**, just because you can skip the previous two games, does not mean that you should. Both Lobotomy Corporation and Library of Ruina are incredibly fun games in their own right that attracted a devoted fanbase even before the gacha dropped. The games are worth checking out, you can play them between the story updates for Limbus. And you'll want to beat them eventually, as the later chapters are bound to have at least some callbacks to the previous games

### What can I expect from this game?
First and foremost, a great story, characters and setting. Project Moon excels at those. On top of that, jank, but fun gameplay that might not be very well-balanced. Library of Ruina during its early access phase kept releasing difficult updates, which were then subsequently nerfed because of Stemfags crying because they couldn't handle a bit of difficulty. 

Also note that, unlike other gachas, we're going to get a set of 12 static characters, for whom we're going to roll for different "outfits" that change how the characters behave in-combat. This is a bad thing in terms of character diversity, but it also means that the characters are going to be well-developed throughout the story, instead of characters being introduced and forgotten constantly, like is the case with other gachas. 

### I heard that the game has a required reading list
Yes, and the books are all classics/great fun. You can find the recommended translations [here](https://rentry.org/ligmabooks), and the full list, which includes the previous two games, [here](https://files.catbox.moe/tgo7m4.png). They're not necessary to understanding the setting, but they're great fun. Some of them, like Metamorphosis, Stranger and Hell Screen, are very short.

### Can I use steam trading cards to fund my gambling addiction? 
Yes, you can. You can convert steam trading cards to steam wallet, and use it to pay for Limbus purchases. The tools below allow you to automate the process.

## Rerolling guide
Necessary setup:
- You need either a phone or an emulator. An emulator allows you to run multiple instances
- Boot up the game
- Create a new guest account
- Play through the tutorial

Now that you're in the main menu screen, you perform the following loop:
- Claim lunacy and tickets from your mailbox.
- Claim lunacy from beating the prologue.
- Roll on the Standard or Focused banner.
- If you're satisfied with your current rolls, bind your account to Google/Apple, and merge your account with Steam
- If you want to reroll: click settings\->account\->close account button
- You'll be booted to login screen. Create new guest account, skip the tutorial and repeat.
You'll want to leave the beginner banner for after the reroll, as it guarantees at least one 000/EGO

# Gameplay
## Mechanics
For now, all we know is that we're getting regular story nodes with mooks, abnormality boss battles and something called MIrror Dungeon, which should be a roguelite way of farming materials. The combat systems are explained in the following videos

## Excel sheet with ID and EGO list
You can find a link with a list of Identities and EGOs, as well as their stats and skills in the link below. It also outlines what some status effects do, and explains some other combat mechanics. Really handy..

## Activities
### Story
Self-explanatory, the main draw of the game. If you beat battles in 10 turns or fewer, you'll get an EX rank, which unlocks extra lunacy rewards. Costs stamina.

### Dungeons
The final level of a chapter. You go through a series of rooms in order to obtain the Golden Bough. Costs Enkephalin Modules (you can exchange your stamina for those) to enter. Contains abnormality battles on top of your regular combat encounters. Very long, but you can save at checkpoints, leave and resume later. Beating the first two is important, as it unlocks tier 3 0 identities and Mirror Dungeons. 

### Mirror Dungeon
The weekly farming stage. There are currently three levels to it - MD1, MD2 normal and MD2 hard. The first one costs 3 modules to enter and rewards you with 10 Battle Pass XP. MD2 normal costs 5 modules to enter and rewards you with 30 Battle Pass XP. MD2 normal is the most efficient way to grind. 

MD2 hard mode can only be completed once a week, costs 18 modules to enter and rewards you with 150 Battle Pass XP. Its huge rewards are offset by it being difficult to complete without a proper strategy. 

On top of the usual rewards, you also have three weekly bonuses, each one granting you 250 lunacy and multiplying the mirror dungeon rewards by 1.5. Entering the hard mode dungeon costs you all three weekly bonuses. 

### Farming stages
Unlocked sometime before chapter 3. Both can be either fought normally, or skipped for extra enkephalin cost if you hate farming. Just note that skipping is less efficient than fighting normally - you don't get as many rewards. 

XP stages have 3 levels - 8, 18 and 28. The higher the enemy level, the higher the rewards. 

Thread stages have 2 levels - 20 and 30.

### Refraction Railway
Endgame hard content. Happens once a season, and you have a month to complete it. It also rewards you with an extra banner based on clear speed that can be used in dick measuring contests.

# Monetisation
Most of the information is from the following video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeMOUVu_HM

## Identities
https://www.prydwen.gg/limbus-company/identities/

This is the main thing you'll be rolling for, it's equivalent to other gacha's units. There are three rarities, denoted by the number of **0**'s. Lowest is **0**, highest is **000**. I think I've seen some anon's theory that it's related to the Kabbalah, but I lost the post somewhere.

1 roll costs 130 lunacy, meaning a 10-roll costs 1300 lunacy. There's also a daily roll system for paying users - 13 lunacy for a single roll. 

You can level up your identities by playing the game or using XP tickets. You can also upgrade them in a different way, using a process called uptying. Think of it as promotions. This gives them new moves, improves their speed die and general stats. Uptying costs threads.

## EGO
This is equivalent to weapons/special moves in other gachas. There are 5 slots for each of the 5 rarities - ZAYIN, TETH, HE, WAW and ALEPH. Each one invokes a different attack and cost a different amount of in-battle resources, with ZAYIN being weak but cheap, and ALEPH being strong but expensive. 

They also change your resistances to different types of attacks. Those factors mean that you shouldn't just focus on the highest rarity EGO, but rather take into account the lower rarity stuff, too.

You obtain EGO both from the gacha, and from the battle pass.

Similarly to identities, you can upgrade EGO using threads. This process is called threadspinning. XP tickets cannot be used on EGO.

## Dupes
We assume that the dupe system will replace the pity system. If you obtain a dupe of an identity, it'll be converted into shards for a specific sinner. If you gather 400 of those, you can convert them into any **000** identity of your liking. The same goes for EGO - all rarities cost 400 shards. **00** identities cost 150 shards.

When rolling, the dupes of identities will be converted into the following number of shards:
**0** | **00** | **000**
:----: | :----: | :----: 
3 | 15  | 50 

As for EGO, rather than being converted into shards, it'll be removed from the rolling pool after you get it for the first time.

## Announcer packs
For now, only Korean voice packs are confirmed. That won't stop me, I need my dose of hagnnouncers, Binah fucking when.

## Battle Pass
The current battle pass price is $11 for 3 months. 
You level the battle pass by completing missions and going through mirror dungeons. The rewards from the BP include Lunacy, EGO, Thread, shards, XP tickets and stamina boxes. Also announcers. 

## Daily roll
An important aspect for evaluating the prices below is the daily roll. You get to roll once a day on each available banner for 10% the price, but you only get to do so with paid lunacy.

## Monthly
You can buy two monthly packs - for $3 and $7. The cheaper one gets you 130 paid lunacy, and 1170 free lunacy spread over 30 days. The $7 one gets you 650 paid lunacy and 1950 free lunacy spread over 30 days.

## Individual currency
You can buy the following currency:
- 70 for $1
- 294 for $4
- 1014 for $12
- 2147 for $24
- 4103 for $42
- 8336 for $80

Not that on your first purchase you'll receive double the lunacy

## Other
You can buy monthly extraction pack for $10, monthly training packs for $31, new manager's onboarding pack for $22 and Season 1 Orienteer Supplies for $60

## Summary
If you want to do 10-pulls on limited banners, go for the monthly packs. If you want to do daily 13 lunacy pulls, go for standalone lunacy packs

## Is it worth spending lunacy on enkephalin refills?
Surprisingly, yes - if you have the Battle Pass. Because you can spend enkephalin modules on mirror dungeon runs, and they net you EGOshards thanks to post-60 battle pass levels, means that you can spend lunacy directly on EGOshards. The lunacy-to-shards conversion efficiency depends on your current max enkephalin (determined by your manager level), but it ranges from 0.269 at 100 max enkephalin to 0.404 at 150 max enkephalin. This means that, in order to get enough shards for a 000/EGO, you need to spend anywhere between 990 and 1486 lunacy. From the moment you reach 115 max enkephalin, converting lunacy to enkephalin and just farming and farming a 000 is cheaper than a 10 pull - 1292 lunacy for a 000.
Only do it once a day, subsequent refills cost extra lunacy. Also note that you need to do a fuckton of grinding, expect like 5-6 Mirror Dungeons a day if you factor in your natural enkephalin regeneration.
