##### Friend Code Database FAQ

!!! Info Note: the FAQ is work in progress.

- What are the benefits of adding people via the Friends system?
	- The main advantage is to be able to borrow your friend's students for raids (Total Assault), Joint Firing Drills and event world raids (Allied Operations).
	- By using the Friend system and the Club system you have access to a maximum of 60 player's borrowed students. (30 for Friends and 30 for Club) In theory this means up to 120 students to select from.
	- You have the ability to offer your students for club members to borrow, there is a passive gain in credits as well as per use of your student.
- I'm low level, will people add me?
	- There's benefits to high level / experienced players to add lower level players to offer their students for borrowing which earns them credits.
	- So there's an incentive for both new or experienced players to have a mixture of people on their list.
- What is the purpose Friend Database?
	- The primary purpose is to provide a quick, streamlined way to find users from /bag/ to add via the Friend feature in Blue Archive.
	- Additionally, if you require a specific student for a Total Assault (Raid) or Joint Firing Drill, you can find a list of users and which student they are offering to borrow.
	- Lastly the intention is to take some of the burden off posting Friend Codes in the general itself.
- Do I need to sign in or share any personal information to use the Google Form or Spreadsheet?
	- No. No sign in or email is required and as a result no emails are collected. This applies for both the form and sheet.
	- When accessing the Google Sheet you are shown as anonymous.
- Where do I find my Friend Code?
	- Go to the settings menu in the top right of the home screen.
	- Select Friends.
	- Click on ID Card top left and note your Friend Code listed next to your level.
- Why do I need to provide my Club ID?
	- As the Friend feature allows you to add people outside of your club to use their borrows, the Club ID is required to make it easier to avoid adding your club members.
	- This avoids duplication by wasting a slot on a club member.
- I made a mistake when submitting my info, can I fix it?
	- Immediately after submitting your information there is a link to edit your response. Please bookmark the link if you think you'll need to edit in the future.
- What if I don't want to submit my info?
	- This is purely optional in the same way as having a club added to the rentry.
	- Close your eyes.
- I have a suggestion for the current Friend Database or a future version, how do I share it?
	- You can tag the OP  or add "rentry" to your post in the current general thread and I'll look at it. (I search each general thread for rentry to capture any club updates.)
	- I can't guarantee any suggestions can be added right away without messing with the current implementation, so even if the suggestion goes ahead it may need to wait until the Friend Database is reset/wiped.

#### Club Info

- What are clubs/circles?
	- They are the guild / clan system in Blue Archive. Benefits of club are listed in the FAQ below.
	- They can hold a maximum of 30 players.
- Public vs Private
	- Public: anyone can apply and join the club as long as there's a free slot.
	- Private: you apply to join the club, your request is visible to the club leader and they will need to accept you.
!!! warning Majority of the clubs in the list are likely to be private, please allow some time for a leader to accept your request.
- Leaving / Joining
	- After leaving a club, you aren't able to join another club until after the next daily reset. (Less than 24 hours.) At which point there's no restriction.

#### Club FAQ

- How up to date is the list of clubs?
	- the list relies on people posting updates in the general, if an update is posted it'll be transferred to this list.
	- the general is checked daily and the last update is quoted at the top.
	- to help players looking for clubs, reporting on your club status from time to time is useful.
!!! warning While clubs are listed as full, club owners can and do routinely clear out inactive players.
- What are the advantages of being in a club?
	- 10 AP daily by accessing the club menu.
	- ability to borrow students from club members for the use in raids (Total Assault), Joint Firing Drills and event world raids (Allied Operations) at the cost of some credits.
	- ability to offer your students for club members to borrow, for each student there is a passive gain in credits over time as well as per borrow of your student.
- I'm low level, should I bother joining a club? Will I get accepted or kicked for being low level?
	- yes, it's worth joining a club at any level, even if only for the 10 AP per day.
	- majority of clubs are accepting of low level (or any level) players.
	- for clubs that are full or close to full, the rule of thumb is if you're active you won't be removed.
	- if you apply to a club, it's good practice to put "bag" in your profile greeting or identify your student profile avatar in the thread - this helps club leaders ensure they accept the right person. It's optional and not required.
