#The Great Bulk, Part 3: Visions of the Future
##On the Trail
After Hitmontop, we secured a few more bounties for ourselves. While catching A-Rank criminals was more of a challenge, it also brought in more income, which obviously meant more supplies. Makuhita and I both now both set out on our missions with a couple of Reviver Seeds, a few Heal Seeds, some Oran Berries, food, and whatever additional odds and ends a particular job might require. It was always good to have a safety net. Our latest job was to catch a thief known as Thievul the Shadow, nicknamed as such due to his ability to steal items unnoticed and slip through the fingers of the law. His talent for such was so great, he was active for even longer than Cacturne.

He had last been seen heading towards Redkiln, a town that, like my own hometown of Oasis, was located in the Midlands. However, while my town was located to the west of Holey Meadow, Redkiln was located to the northeast. Naturally, the two of us travelled there, hoping to stop him in his tracks.

Redkiln was larger than I remember my hometown being. Buildings made of brick dotted the area, bringing to mind what the town was known for – ceramics, pottery in particular. I even had some stoneware from Redkiln back in my old home, before my partner stumbled over it and smashed it to pieces. 

Speaking of Makuhita, he immediately lost sight as to the purpose of our arrival, splitting off from me and socializing with the locals. I, however, kept my eyes on our goal. I went around and asked residents for any information that would be useful – sightings of strange Pokemon, reports of robberies and attacks, and so on. Two patterns quickly emerged.

The first, was that the only strange Pokemon they recalled seeing was Makuhita himself.  One Raboot complained that he fell on one of her pots, although he was quick to compensate her for the damage. The second pattern was that there had recently been a series of thefts, which followed a predictable pattern. The more affluent individuals of Redkiln would fall asleep, and during the night, their valuables would all be stolen. One Dusclops who slept with his coinpurse under his bed even reported having it pilfered!

Pokemon with more acute senses of smell reported only the scent of dirt, the only clue the thief would leave behind being a single card with a footprint on it. I didn't have any copies to analyze, nor was I an expert in footprints, but it sounded similar enough to our target's usual course of action for me to know who it was.

Thievul was here. I just needed to get a list of potential victims who hadn't been hit yet, and we could start from there. We had enough Poke and food to last us for a couple of weeks, if I got onto Makuhita enough for his gluttony. As I prepared for another round of questioning, something large impacted me, and I was sent to the ground. Looking towards the object's direction, I could see what it was. My companion had returned.

I got up, glaring at him. “What do you think you're doing?” I harshly reprimanded. “You went to slack off with the locals, and you're still as blind as a Zubat. You need to watch where you're going!” Even though Makuhita was a friend, now, he still needed to be more focused.

He simply shrugged. “Yeah, Asana, I know. I'm a klutz, and I'm sorry for it. I swear I wasn't this bad before the concussion,” he said. Makuhita took a few seconds to think. “Anyway, I learned a few things. Rich folks have been getting robbed, and the richest one who hasn't been hit yet is some lady named Espathra. She's a former explorer and a “seer” of some sort, and she's loaded as heck. It's irresistable bait for our outlaw! We should go talk with her; maybe guard her place for a few nights.”

It was clear I was wrong about him again – he wasn't wasting time at all.. I nodded in agreement, and I let Makuhita lead me to Espathra's dwelling. The dwelling was much larger than any of the others I had seen; a titan hewn of brick with twin statues flanking the front entrance. Even if they were made of stone, the two Corviknights standing guard were so realistic, one couldn't help but feel intimidated by their gaze.

##Tea for Four
As soon as we arrived at the door, I could hear the clicking of footsteps. It opened, revealing a rather strange bird Pokemon. They towered over the both of us combined; even if I stood on Makuhita's shoulders they would dwarf us by at least a foot. Their elegant, bright plumage gave the impression of a fancy dress that only the wealthiest Pokemon could afford, while their body plan was similar to that of a Dodrio, although with one head rather than three.

The bizarre Pokemon before us bent her neck downwards, her unfocused gaze staring at the spot between us both. “Ah... It isn't often I get many visitors. Welcome to my home,” she welcomed. “I am Espathra. The two of you are a Meditite and a...” She trailed off, looking more closely at Makuhita. “Why, I don't think I've seen a Pokemon of your kind before!” She exclaimed. “I've been everywhere, so tell me, traveller, who are you exactly?”

Her behavior was as eccentric as her appearance, but my partner either didn't notice, or didn't care. “I'm just a Makuhita, lady,” he said. Espathra squinted her eyes at him, silence hanging in the air.

“You don't look like one, though,” she said confusedly. “May I examine you more closely?” She asked. Makuhita nodded. Espathra raised a talon and gently took hold of my partner's gut, balancing delicately on her other leg as she did so. She squeezed it lightly. “Leathery skin; fat with muscle underneath... You feel like a Makuhita, but you don't -look- like one, dear,” she said, withdrawing her leg and returning to her previous posture.

This was one of the most unusual interactions I've seen, even stranger than what my friend puts me through on a daily basis! How could she claim to “see” Makuhita, yet have to feel his flesh to verify his species? He was identical to any other of his kind, except for one aspect...

His Aura. The texture of it was unlike any other. “Are you able to only see his Aura?” I asked.

Espathra gazed towards me, and nodded. “Being born without sight is especially crippling for me, but in return, I can see that which others cannot. I'm no Master, but I served as the eyes of my team for many decades. Come on in, it isn't often I meet someone else who walks the Path!” She gestured for the two of us to enter.

We walked in, and were swiftly guided to a dining room. Makuhita and I sat, while our host remained standing. “Indeedee, we've got guests!” She shouted. “Please fix the three of us some tea!” I heard footsteps much lighter than even my own, a flash of dark blue running by us and into the nearby kitchen.

“That's one fast butler you have!” Makuhita exclaimed. This elicited a tense reaction from our host, Espathra narrowing her eyes at him.

“Dear, that isn't my butler. You're lucky he didn't hear you call him that, or he would've flung you across the room,” she uttered. “He's my husband, and was one third of our old group, Team Watchers. Now, tell me, why did the two of you venture here?”

“To put it briefly, a certain thief has been active here lately, stealing from richer Pokemon while they sleep,” I explained. “My partner thinks you'll be his next victim, and according to the intelligence I gathered, he's extremely meticulous and stealthy. He even covers his scent.”

Espathra looked a bit concerned by this development. “Neither Indeedee or I were the heavy hitters of our team. Any protection you can offer is appreciated, and on top of that, you both are quite interesting, especially that Makuhita.”

My partner stared at her, seeming a bit tense. “I don't know why you're taking such an interest in me. I don't have anything interesting for you to learn about me; I lost all my memory after I fell off of my buddy Asana's roof and landed head-first.”

I groaned in annoyance at Makuhita's behavior. He always had to use that same tactic, didn't he? “He always comes up with a new concussion-related excuse every time you ask him about his past,” I explained. I began to count on my fingers. “One time, he said it was that outlaw Cacturne that hit him. Another time, his sidekick. Another time, he said it happened after a Meowth threw a pot at his head after he swiped her meal. Yet another time, it was a freak sparring accident with a Machop, then it was a rockslide that impacted him head-first, then he said he got something called “CTE” from a Hitmonchan, then it was-” I trailed off, interrupted by the realization that I was out of fingers. “You get the point.”

Espathra giggled as I recounted Makuhita's numerous amnesia backstories. “Your friend sounds like quite the character, and his Aura's so interesting, too! A blazing bonfire of red, some pink, a dash of fuschia; it's clear he's a stubborn one who forges his own path! It served him well, too. For someone so young, his Aura is awfully worn, yet it stands unwavering, like a statue standing proudly in the face of Father Time.” The avian hostess looked straight at my partner, her expression beaming. “It isn't often I see someone your age, who has gone through so much hardship. It's even less common, for them to have taken it as well as you.”

My friend was completely silent and was visibly uncomfortable. Something Espathra said must've bothered him. “I, uh... Don't go reading my mind, okay?” Makuhita asked. “There's some memories I'd rather leave behind. I've gotten past all that hurt, but I still don't like lingering on it for too long.”

Espathra's mirth vanished. “Oh. I wasn't reading your mind. I can't even use psychic abilities, save for one. I suspect the same birth defect that rendered me blind is responsible for that.”

“Save for one?” I chimed in.

Espathra nodded. “I can see the future, although if you want a reading, it won't be tonight. It takes a lot out of me.” She pointed a talon at me. “As for you, what's your name?

“I'm Asana, and Makuhita doesn't have a name,” I replied.

“You're a very guarded Pokemon, aren't you?” Espathra asked.

I forced a straight face, in an attempt to hide how her reading unnerved me. “How do you know that?” I replied.

“All Aura comes from the soul, dear,” she began to elucidate. “One's personality and experiences are imprinted upon it. I was born with the Sight, and with my eighty-seven years of experience, the marks your psyche and experiences leave behind are as clear as day to me. The hues of your Aura are more balanced than your friend's, yet it is also plain; barren almost. Not much has shaped it. The silver in yours is just barely dominant, with a mixture of two blues dimly shining from behind it. Tell me, are you a busybody? The type who'd rather coop themselves up with their work, rather than bother with getting to know others?”

Espathra's skill at reading Aura was transparently at a level leagues beyond my own. She might not have been capable of reading our minds, but in a way, she could see deeper than that; being able to elucidate the natures of our very souls. “Yes,” I said with some hesitation. “I'd rather train, than do what Makuhita does. I don't know how he can stand talking with so many strangers in a single day, it'd drain me if I were in his position.”

As our hostess was about to reply, Indeedee walked into the room, carrying our tea via telekinesis. He sets the tray on the table and takes a seat himself, looking toward his wife. “Don't mind me,” he told her. “Continue with whatever you were speaking of.”

As Indeedee used his psychic abilities to pour us our tea, Espathra continued where she left off. “I can see the wall you put up around yourself. It's crippling you, in more ways than one. Tell me, when was the last time you felt genuine joy? When was the last time you had any experiences that impacted you, or made you grow as a Pokemon?”

As I wracked my brain, I could feel Indeedee's mind reaching out to it. “What are you doing?” I asked. He began to add sugar to all the tea cups save his own, his demeanour unchanging. “I was retrieving information on how you and your partner prefer your tea,” he said. “I only read portions of the mind that are relevant on how to best accomodate my wife's guests; to pry into personal matters would be a dire breach of etiquette.”

Espathra nodded. “My husband takes etiquette very seriously. I've seen him throw Pokemon out for offenses as minor as tracking dirt in!”

I briefly wondered how someone as nonassuming as Indeedee could be a threat to a grown Pokemon, but I pushed those thoughts aside. “You wanted to know when I was last happy, right?” I asked. “Before I met Makuhita, I really can't remember any happy times. I was always off by myself training, or stuck working the caravans as a sentry. After, he helped me reach a milestone with my Aura that I had been struggling with for years without even knowing it, and I felt happy then. I also felt the same the few times he's made me laugh. He's the only friend I have, and I don't know how he puts up with me.”

Makuhita snickered. “Well, it's because I know you can do better than you are now. How many times were you plotting to murder me while I slept, just because my snoring kept you awake?”

“Twice,” I answered honestly.

“Well, that's a lot less than you could've otherwise!” He replied jovially. “Even if you're kinda like a living cactus sometimes, I know you're good deep down. If you had no empathy locked away in that head of yours, I'd be a pile of bones in the desert.”

I shook, my friend's words digging into me. “Don't call me good,” I barked. “I'm not some hero like you think I am. I nearly doomed us both back on our first big job, and I blamed you for it! Then, you persuaded that outlaw to reform, while I would've just let Magnezone throw him into a cell and be done with it. What sort of “hero” can't see the good in others?”

Makuhita's smile grew wider. “You might not consider yourself some paragon of goodness, but you *can* be better, Asana. You aren't damned to repeat the same mistakes all your life.” He stretched for a moment, yawning as he did so. “I know that truth well. If I stayed the same person I started out as, you wouldn't even recognize me.”

The four of us were silent for a few moments, taking the time to sip the tea Indeedee had prepared. Makuhita had a bit of difficulty due to his lack of fingers, instead lifting his cup up with the ends of his arms. Espathra, meanwhile, gripped hers with a talon, balancing masterfully on her free leg. She bent her neck downwards, taking a sip, before setting her drink back on the table. Surprisingly, Indeedee was the next to speak. “Your friend's right,” he said. “Nothing is set in stone. The future can be changed; even fate itself can be skewed if you're creative enough to twist words of prophecy. My wife knows a hundred and one stories of how Pokemon over the ages have done so... It's quite ironic, knowing a history buff that can't read.”

I still hadn't said anything, my friend's reassurances rattling me to my core. The conversation had grown quiet, only for the stillness to be broken by Espathra. “The tinge of one's Aura is only a starting point; a template. Even the most timid of Pokemon can find their spine; the most violent something they wish to love and protect from the bottom of their hearts,” she began. “There are many good Pokemon out there waiting to get to know you, and if you ever want to walk the Path to its completion, you need to come down from your fortress of solitude.”

The hostess takes another sip of her tea, continuing. “Many who I've seen walk this road are martial artist types, much like yourself. They know that honing your Aura takes hard work and dedication, just like training any muscle of their physical body, but due to the lens with which they see the world, they miss the whole picture.”

Espathra tilted her head upwards, revealing a faint smile. “True mastery requires you to know and be honest with yourself, and to open your heart up to others. Every friendship made; every life touched is a brick in a tower climbing skywards. Think about it in this manner: You can't tower above the rest, without a foundation to stand upon. The hardiest of bird Pokemon would get tired, trying to reach beyond the sky. Those that float would likely take multiple lifetimes to get there, and even then, exhaustion would reach them eventually. Breaching the heavens on your lonesome is a fool's errand.”

Sitting her now-emptied tea down, she finished her speech. “Aura is far more than a mere weapon or tool. It can bring others together. It's a way to see the unseen; know truths that are buried beyond the eyes of the layman. Perhaps if combat wasn't so deeply intertwined with Pokemon-kind as a whole, more would see things the way I do.”

The bird's philosophy was unusual, but even if I were to throw out what was related to Aura, she would still be right. I was living in a psychological prison. Still, one question was at the tip of my tongue. “If you know so much, why aren't you a Master yourself?” I asked. “Did you simply wish to walk your own path?”

Indeedee and I continued to drink our tea, the other two having already finished theirs. “To use Aura beyond the Sight is quite impractical for me,” Espathra said, her reply sounding slow and deliberate. “Due to the circumstances of my birth, only expelling it through my talons is feasible, due to my eyes and frills being cut off from me. If I wanted to do it, I'd have to stop moving, raise a leg, and fire, leaving me open and vulnerable.  In addition, when I try to concentrate my Aura in my eyes, they react in the most unusual manner.”

She looked downward, her mood becoming much more solemn. “It lights the spark, activating my buried psychic potential by force. Then, my visions come. It's the only time I can see *anything* normally, and my eyes burn through nearly all of my Aura in the process. It's like running a marathon, without lifting a talon. Sometimes I wish I was born normal, but then again...”

She stared at Makuhita. “The cards I was dealt shaped who I was. If I was a regular Espathra, I wouldn't have become an explorer. I wouldn't have met my husband, or made all the memories I had with my team. You can always shape pain and hardship into something positive.”

My partner nodded. “That's the story of my life, right there,” Makuhita stated. “I wish I had someone like you growin' up, Espathra; someone who was a real role model. The only things I had were my buddies and my little brother. If it weren't for them, I wouldn't have strived to be someone better.”

Makuhita's normally upbeat nature became more subdued, giving way to a distinct sadness. It was an unusual sight to see, as before tonight, I didn't even think it was in his emotional repertoire! “It's easier to fight, when you've got something worth upholding; someone worth protecting. Dr-... He's always had trouble standing up for himself, and I worry about him sometimes. My friends are important to me, too, but they know how to take care of themselves. My brother would've loved it here, even if this wo-”

He stopped himself again. “...Err, this place can be rough at times. I tried teaching him the best I can, and I'm always afraid it wasn't enough.”

“All young must leave the nest one day,” Indeedee replied. “All you can do is have faith in him, Makuhita. You guided him, but now, he'll need to apply the wisdom you gave him and grow in his own way.”

My friend sighed. “You're right, although I think we've wandered pretty far off-track. Since you weren't here when I told your wife, you do know about the recent robberies, right?” Makuhita asked.

Indeedee nodded, Makuhita continuing his explanation shortly after. “Well, you and your wife are the juciest targets the culprit hasn't hit yet. I was thinking we could stay a few days and have Asana and Espathra keep watch in shifts. Our Pokemon is sneaky, but the both of them could sniff him out easy with their Aura stuff. Your wife can take the first part of the night shift, and Asana can do the second, since she tends to wake up early anyways. We've even got our own food, so you wouldn't have to feed us,” Makuhita finished. “How does that sound?”

Espathra appeared to be deep in thought. “Certainly, dear, although we can easily feed you both. I can even offer the both of you something,” she added.

I looked at Makuhita, then at her, knowing she was ignorant of the burden she was putting onto herself with her offer of free meals. “That isn't a good idea,” I said. “My friend is a shameless glutton. He almost rendered me bankrupt with his eating habits, before we began our bounty hunting career.”

Espathra smiled at me, unphased by my warning. “That can be easily fixed! Indeedee, can you look through our old gear for a Stamina Band?” She asked. Indeedee nodded, and walked off. “Your friend is no problem for me, Asana. As for my offer, I'd love to teach you both what I know about Aura, although it would be comparatively little to a true Master. I can only plant the seeds; it'd be up to you both to tend to them.”

Makuhita was the first to show skepticism. “I can't tell what my partner even means half the time when she talks about that stuff. It's like trying to explain what music is, to someone who's born deaf.”

Espathra giggled in reply to my friend's doubts, clearly being amused by his analogy. “Anyone can walk the Path with proper guidance and diligence, Makuhita, and I have a special brew that'll help. An old friend of mine helped devise it. She was our third member, in fact. Hatterene loved collecting and concocting recipes of all sorts. Whether it was food, tea, or medicine, she was a font of knowledge.”

“What happened to her?” I asked. “You make it sound like you lost contact with her.”

“She's so much of a busybody that she refused to retire,” Espathra said. “She's well into her 90's and she's still traipsing around old ruins. Now, are the two of you interested in what I have to offer?”

I nodded in an instant. Makuhita took longer to think it over, but he soon did the same. Indeedee then returned, affixing the Band he retrieved onto my friend's wrist. “It's settled, then,” Espathra stated. “I'll begin tutoring you both tomorrow. I'll wake you up when it's time for your shift, Asana.”

With that, the four of us finished our day. Makuhita and I went to sleep in the guest room, my mind at this point having learned how to tune out his loud snoring. Meanwhile, Indeedee retreated to his and Espathra's bedroom, away from the noise. Lucky him.

##Day 1 - Assignment
Espathra woke me up late for my shift. I kept watch for a few hours, silence being my only company. I didn't detect any unusual Auras approaching her home, and the night was uneventful. As night turned into morning, Indeedee was the first to awaken, meeting me as I settled down from my vigil.

“Care for some breakfast?” He asked. “I can make dishes for all sorts of palettes.”

I shook my head. “No, I only eat a berry a day. It keeps all six of my senses sharp.”

Indeedee frowned, but quickly composed himself. “Well, I could make some tea and get you your daily meal. I keep all sorts of berries stocked up.”

I nodded at him, a smile creeping up on my features. “Tea sounds nice.”

I felt Indeedee nudge at my mind again, and then run off to the kitchen immediately after. I navigated the house more slowly and deliberately, looking at the numerous paintings throughout the house's walls. Most of them were portraits or depictions of various ruins, although one close to the dining room itself caught my eye.

It was of Espathra, flanked by her husband and a third Pokemon. The third was cloaked in a strange, dress-like natural covering, leaving only their face visible. Atop their head was a body part akin to a pointy hat, a tentacle dangling from where the point should've ended. Indeedee was grinning towards the perspective of the painter, with both of his thumbs up. He exuded a vibrant energy and confidence that, in the present, seemed more subdued.

Espathra's wings were extended, almost looking like a theater curtain providing a backdrop for her companions. Her expression was hard to read due to her avian features, but she seemed content.

The third Pokemon, clad in blue and pink, seemed far more uncomfortable. Her gaze was shifted downwards and her head was turned away, awkwardness clinging onto her like static electricity. All three in the painting had a badge affixed to them, depicting an open eye. Considering the name of Espathra's team, and comments she made, this must've been Hatterene.

As I continued to focus on the painting, I felt Indeedee tap my shoulder. “The tea's done, Asana,” he reminded me. “I see you're interested in our group painting. Come, I can tell you more about ourselves in the dining room.”

The two of us walked to the dining room, and sat. Indeedee handed me a small tray with my cup of tea, alongside a rather bizare, large blue berry. I stared at it. “This is big,” I said. “Its size is so great, I'm not sure if I should even be eating this. I usually only eat Orans.”

Indeedee snickered. “Well, it's okay to live a little sometimes, Asana. Plus, it **technically** isn't breaking your dietary rule. I think your reluctance will melt away, once you try it. Besides, it's bad etiquette to refuse a host's generousity, and you know what happens to those in this house who tread on that sacred principle, right?~”

I shrugged.

I could see a dangerous, mischevious glint in Indeedee's eyes. He flipped from being unassuming to ominous in an instant, sending chills down my spine. “I'll use my telekinesis and give you a one-way flight around the Sand Continent! Now, chow down or face my wrath.~”

I gulped, and took the strange berry from my tray. I took a single bite from it, and immediately, a sour taste flooded my mouth, a spicy backdrop adding complexity to its flavor. My eyes widened, as I realized something – this was the best thing I had ever eaten! I was tempted to devour it all in quick succession, my discipline only barely managing to restrain myself before I took a page out of Makuhita's playbook.

Indeedee clapped, his Aura simmering with smug satisfaction. “I was right again! I knew you'd love that Belue berry, although they aren't exactly common. Go ahead and eat up; I'll tell you all about the Watchers while you do.”

I took a sip of tea, and then began to slowly eat my berry in silence, chewing slowly and savoring each bite. “We were an exploration team dedicated to exploring old ruins and deciphering their secrets”, he began. “My wife was the leader. She used her Aura sensing abilities to detect hidden passages and find details that would be lost upon any other Pokemon. From those we've met in our travels, I think my wife views Aura very differently compared to most. They mostly viewed it in the context of fighting, battling, and so on. Essy's vision of it is more esoteric than that. To her, Aura allows its user to see the unseeable, alongside the strings of love and fate that bind all who meet together, like the web of an Ariados.”

Indeedee continued. “I, myself, was the one who organized supplies, read old inscriptions, plotted our courses, and so on. Since my wife couldn't read, I had to pick up the slack in that department. When we had to fight, I assisted our main battler, Hatterene. She was an introverted sort like you, but she was a natural at combat. I'd always charge the rooms we were in with psychic energy, and helped to amplify her damage output tremendously. During peaceful times, she was an excellent cook and medic. She didn't open up to many, but to those she trusted, she had a heart of gold. You could rely on her no matter what.”

I had finished my food for the day at this point. I took another sip of my tea. “Did you learn from her? Makuhita's the only friend I've had, and yet, I feel like he's already taught me a lot.”

Indeedee nodded, smiling at me. “She taught me everything I know. A good companion is priceless; worth more than all of the treasures in the world.”

“If it weren't for Makuhita, I wouldn't be alive,” I replied.

The room fell into an awkward silence. Neither I or Indeedee said a word, the two of us simply soaking in the gravity of my words. It was only disrupted by the arrival of Espathra, who waved a wing at us both. “Good morning!” She said excitedly. “Asana, are you ready for your instructions?”

I nodded. Espathra guided me to the front door. As we passed through it, I could see the statues guarding her entrance stare at us both. Their presence still made me feel on edge. We walked a few feet away from the front, and my mentor looked down at me.

“Do you have a training routine?” She asked.

“Yes,” I replied. “I do my yoga in the morning, after I've woken up. If we aren't busy with a job, Makuhita and I fight later in the day. He might not seem like much, but I have to use every ounce of force I can muster, just to keep him down. It's the only way I can train Expression, although I know you probably won't be able to help me much there.”

Espathra thought to herself. “Perhaps during the times when your partner isn't around, you could try more active forms of exercise? Considering what little I know about Expression, try tinkering around with the two together, and you may find results. Although, while you stay here, that won't be your focus.”

I was confused. “Focus?” I asked. “I don't understand.”

“Do you remember what I said last night, Asana?” She asked. “You have the discipline, and the work ethic. Yet, you lack the final piece of the puzzle. Since you have a hard time getting to know others, I'll send you to some Pokemon around town.” Espathra handed me a badge showing an eye wide open – the same as the ones in the team portrait I had examined earlier. “If they're skeptical of your intentions, show them this. They'll know you were sent by either Indeedee or myself. We're not leaders, by any means, but we're very well respected.”

I looked at the badge and it returned the favor; unblinking as the gears in my head turned. “I don't understand how loitering around with a bunch of strangers would help me. Yet, if Makuhita will be busy, I suppose there isn't much else for me to do,” I mused. Looking up, my eyes met Espathra's. “I'll give your methods a chance, as unorthodox as they are. Are there any Pokemon in particular I should start out with?”

Espathra nodded. “Mhm. There's a Polteageist that could teach you a thing or two. He's one of the local potters; one of the best in fact.”

I still felt skeptical of her. I breathed in deeply. “Understood. Tell me where he is located, and I will meet up with him once I am done with my exercises.”

“The potters work in the center part of town near the kilns,” my mentor replied. Armed with this knowledge, I departed, intent on getting my morning routine out of the way.

##Day 1 - Imperfect
I arrived at my destination, looking for Polteageist. I found him working a strange contraption – it was comprised of a larger wheel, connected to a smaller one on top with a pole. By kicking the lower portion with one of his legs, he caused both parts to rotate, as he shaped a bowl on the upper wheel. I approached him, waiting for him to stop. When he did so, he looked up at me. “The heck do you want?” He asked. “I'm tryin' to work here. Art doesn't make itself!”

I observed him for a few moments. The teapot he lived in was of noticably lesser quality than most of his kind, being white with a few specks of blue paint dotting it. I showed him the badge that I was given. “Espathra wanted me to learn from you, for whatever reason. I don't know if she wants me to help you make pottery, or just speak to you. She was rather vague.”

Polteageist frowned. “That old kook sent you? I should boot you out, but I do owe her a favor. I guess I'll show you how to make something basic, pass on something she told me, a long time ago.”

He floated away from his miniature potter's wheel and grabbed a hunk of clay, it strangely not growing wet in spite of his body's liquid composition. He placed it on the center of his wheel and began to float a bit off of the ground, one of his stubby legs extending unnaturally. He began to kick the lower portion of his workstation, it rotating as he began to shape the clay.

Only now, did the clay appear to wetten. “Watch me closely, girl,” he commanded. “You gotta center it when you're starting. If you're lazy and make it without the proper prep work, it'll only bite you in the ass later on. Anyone else would need to wet their hands before they do this, but that's the neat thing about being a tea ghost – I'm always wet, and I can choose how my body interacts with the world around me. I can leave nothin' behind when I touch something one second, and leave it soaking wet the next.”

Once the mass had been properly centered, he began to push on the center lightly, making a small indentation. Using his fingers, he began to pull the outer portion up. “Next is the walls of the bowl. Keep 'em thick, you'll need it for when you pull them out.” The diameter of the bowl grows wider, and then, to my surprise, some of the liquid that accumulated inside of it gets soaked up by his hand! “You'll need to clean up any excess fluid. Again, my body's useful for this, while you'd need to have something like... A sponge, I guess.” 

Polteageist takes an oddly shaped, sharp piece of metal, and waves it around with his free hand. “This thing's a rib. I'm gonna use it to trim the inside of this, like so.” He then begins to trim the interior, making the inside of the bowl look neater. He then takes what appears to be a piece of wire and cuts under the bowl, and gently removes it from his wheel, setting it aside. “This little bastard's gotta dry for a while, but I don't want it -too- dry. It needs to get to a certain point that people in the business call “leather-hard”, due to its consistency.” He points at me. “Now, you. Espathra's girl. You never gave me your name.”

I snapped out of the trance I was in while watching Polteageist worked – I was always like that, when I had to absorb a lot of information at once. “I'm Asana,” I said. “Before we start, on an unrelated note... Have you been robbed, recently?”

My teacher for the day scowled, his anger barely restrained. “Yep. Bastard snuck into my home and took the cash I had that wasn't locked away in my secret stash. It was the second-worst robbery I've ever been a victim of.”

“Second-worst?” I asked.

Polteageist made an approximation of a nod with his body. “Yep. I'll tell you about it later, but for now, I need you to get to work. I'm here to teach you, not just chatter and yammer on all day!”

I grabbed some clay and put it on top of an unoccupied wheel. I then grabbed a bowl of water, a rib, a small length of wire, and a sponge. Kicking the lower portion of the potter's wheel and wettening my hands, I began to center the mass of clay, although I had a bit harder time building up the walls of my bowl, due to having less fingers than Polteageist did. I pulled out the walls, used a sponge to clean up the excess, and trimmed the interior with the rib, then cutting my creation loose and setting it by Polteageist's.

It looked a bit lumpier and more imperfect compared to his. I prepared to grab it so I could destroy it and start all over, but he floated in front of me, stopping me in my tracks. “Don't go and destroy your hard work,” he scolded. “You done your first bowl better than most of the schmucks that they send in for me to teach.”

I glared at him, growing agitated. “How can you defend something as bad as this? You're supposed to be a master, and here you are, defending that piece of garbage I manufactured! I don't get it-”

He interrupted me. “Asana, we all have to start from somewhere. I was a whole lot worse than you when I started out. I was just some kid who got swindled, and wanted to make what I actually -wanted- to own. I regret smashing most of my old projects every day. They were a good measure to see how far I've come, and I destroyed them out of embarassment. My first ten years of hard work, lost to history.”

I calmed myself down, and continued to listen to Polteageist further. “Even if what you make isn't perfect, it's a product of -your- labor; your blood, sweat, and tears. Take pride in it, and if it has its flaws, learn from them!” He exclaimed. “Now, take a seat. While we wait for our bowls to dry, I'm gonna tell you why I got into pottery.”

I took a seat as instructed, Polteageist sitting on the table in front of me. “My kind're all pottery snobs, myself included,” he started. “I was lucky enough to be born into a fancy, expensive cup as a Sinistea. I was the envy of my fellows, since most don't have that privilege. I wanted to evolve for the longest time, but I didn't have nearly enough Poke to buy the high-quality sort of teapot I wanted to go into.”

“One day, that changed. This green, lanky-looking fellow with a scar on his arm came into town, hawking evolutionary wares at prices cheaper than normal. He had your typical stones, alongside more esoteric things. I remember there being a few ribbons, this beautiful-looking scarf, and to my luck, a teapot that seemed to fit my standards. I got all the money I saved up, and went to him. He told me in that tired-sounding voice of his that it'd be perfect for someone like me to evolve into. I paid for it, went to evolve a couple days later, and did so. It was only some time after that when the paint started to chip off, and I figured it out.”

Polteageist paused, shame evident in his eyes. “It was a forgery. He took a white teapot and painted some blue decorations on it to make it look like porcelain. I should've been able to tell just by it not having the slight translucency of the real deal, but I was young and naive. The paint was probably made from Orans, too. Oran Blue is cheap, but it's bad at staying on stuff if you don't mix it right. I started my pottery career because of that, my initial goal being to make a genuine version of the teapot I saw at that conman's stand. I made and threw out countless pieces of pottery I deemed to be of lesser stock. It took five years for me to create something that was acceptable by my own standards, and five after that to create the teapot of my dreams. I thought I'd feel accomplished, but instead, I felt hollow inside.”

He trailed off, thinking of the right words to say. “I was still stuck in the bootleg I was given, and I can't get out of it. I wasted ten years of my life competing against a Pokemon who put no love into his craft. He probably wouldn't even remember my face if he seen me again. I didn't know what to do, but then came along Espathra. Her and her husband had just retired and returned to Redkiln, which was the latter's hometown. One night, she told me somethin' important.”

Polteageist's usually bitter, serious mood faded, the ghost smiling as he recounted what happened next. “She said that the journey's more important than the destination, and that the imperfections are just as important as the good parts; they're just part of your work's character. The reason I wasn't happy was because I couldn't accept any flaws; any deviations from my plans. I wasn't putting any love into my work, either. It was only spite. Once I learned to love my ceramics for what they were and to take one day at a time, their quality skyrocketed. It's been 20 years since I bought the pot I live in, and I'm one of the few fellas on the Sand Continent who can make good porcelain. However, you're only making stoneware. Oh, by the way, I gotta ask you something.”

“What is it?” I asked.

“Did you come into town with anyone else?” He questioned. “There was another Pokemon coming in yesterday chatting it up and asking about robberies. The fat idiot fell on one of my buddy's pots!”

I flinched, as I immediately realized who he was speaking of. “That's *my* fat idiot,” I responded. “He's my friend. He's clumsy, but I'm beginning to think he's smarter than he lets on.”

Polteageist muttered to himself. “Well, I hope he doesn't trouble you too much. I'd hate to be shackled to a guy like that.”

We waited for our bowls to sufficiently dry. In the heat of the Sand Continent's sun, they did so rather quickly, Polteageist and I returning to work. We trimmed the exteriors of our bowls, but that was about the extent of our progress. He explained to me that the bowls had to dry until they were, in his words, “bone-dry”, and then be glazed and fired over another day. I would have to come back in a few days to retrieve the final product.

I returned to Espathra's dwelling after that, the sun above me telling me that the day was coming to a close. We all had dinner together, although as per my diet, I abstained from any food, only drinking the tea that Indeedee had provided. Makuhita was strangely non-talkative, instead spending most of his time clutching his head. He mumbled on occasion and, even taking the Stamina Band into account, ate little by his standards. “What happened to my partner?” I asked.

Our hostess looked a bit nervous. “Well, what I've been giving him has some side effects, Asana. It opens up his mind more and calms it in order to make learning how to sense Aura easier, but he also...” Espathra looked down at Indeedee. “Dear, what was the term Makuhita used?”

He giggled at her. “He said he was “tripping balls”, Essy. There's a lot of ingredients in that brew. Soothing, Eyedrop, and X-eye seeds, a Mix Elixer, Iapapa Berry juice, some psychoactive herbs, and much more.” I sat there, my mouth agape with shock.

“Y-you're intoxicating him?” I stammered out.

Espathra nodded. “I told him what would happen, and the risks of it, but he agreed to it. He said that he didn't want to be “an outlaw's punching bag” again, and that he wanted to have as many tricks as possible to avoid a repeat of that.”

I groaned, as I put the pieces together. He must've taken his defeat from Hitmontop far worse than I thought, and simply chose to hide it from me! Why did he choose to do something this stupid, instead of simply asking for combat advice? It almost reminded me of something I would do, but I had enough of an idea of who Makuhita was to dispel that notion. I would've refused to admit my weakness out of pride, but he didn't take much value in it.

So, why did he do it? I tried my hardest to figure out my friend's machinations, Espathra and Indeedee both growing concerned by my quietness. “Is something the problem?” The former asked.

Her words pierced through my consciousness, halting the state of focus I was in. “I don't get why he did it,” I responded. “I know the exact incident you speak of, and he could've talked to me about it, instead of agreeing to being drugged up for the duration of his stay. It would've been far more practical to discuss countermeasures against speedy opponents, instead of **this**.”

“I think I understand,” Indeedee chimed in. “Your partner doesn't like to appear vulnerable or weak. He's used to being the shield of others and the one who bears their burdens, and he's afraid if he reveals any cracks, that the people he protects will no longer have faith in him.”

Indeedee's tone of voice sounded oddly serious, as he continued speaking. “I remember my wife and him talking about shaping pain into a tool for good. Then, there was the talk about his brother. I gathered the final pieces of the puzzle earlier, but I am not one to share private conversations without prior consent.”

Makuhita looked as though he wasn't even there, with him being more focused on holding his head and grumbling in pain. Meanwhile, Indeedee started to sound much more stern, his razor-sharp glare keeping me in line. “That Pokemon cares more for you than you know. He fusses over you the same way my elder sister did with me. You're lucky to have someone like that as your teammate, and if you dare take him for granted, I will track you down across the world if I have to, just to slap you back into reality. Do you understand me?”

I nodded, beads of sweat dripping down my face. I wiped it off with a hand, stammering out my reply. “I-I learned to value him after that run you speak of. He can be annoying, but he's a valuable friend and ally.”

Indeedee snickered to himself. “Good, good.~ Even Essy and I get on each other's nerves, sometimes.”

Espathra looked around nervously and kept her head down, resigning herself to peck at her dinner. The evening continued in awkward silence.

##Day 2 – Dethorned Rose
As I kept watch during my shift, I thought of Polteageist. It was interesting to look at the perspective of a craftsman, and the turn of fate that led him to his career. I felt a bit of a kinship with him, in spite of his attitude – I was an artist, but of a different sort. While some of his advice regarding imperfection didn't feel valid in my profession, what he told me about the journey being what counted rather than the destination, kept echoing throughout my mind. Makuhita's bumbling forced me to take one day at a time, and oddly enough, it made me more fulfilled.

As morning came, I was given another assignment. Today, I was to help a Maractus named Sonora prune some weeds from her garden. As soon as I went through the motions of my morning routine, I walked towards her house.

When I arrived, I found it to be much smaller than Espathra's. Either Sonora had less Poke than Espathra's gigantic nest egg, pun unintended, or she chose to live more frugally out of choice. In fact, the huge stretch of flora out front had more of a presence than her dwelling! She was by the entrance of her home, clearly expecting me.

Walking up to her, I noticed multiple traits that made her stand out. When I pictured a gardener, my mind created an image of a dainty Pokemon, and she was anything but. She wore a rough-looking brown poncho and had numerous scars all across her body, and she looked as if she were seconds away from choosing between fight or flight. I could practically feel the nervousness and anxiety coming from her. She gave a quick wave towards me, her eyes darting away from my presence. “You're Asana, right? Espathra told me about you yesterday; said that you might come and help me out.”

I nodded, although her demeanour and words brought up more questions. “Espathra told you about me?” I asked. “That's odd. She said to show her exploration team's old badge to the people she directed me to, I didn't think she'd approach anyone herself.”

Sonora shook a bit, trying her best to force a smile. “W-well, I haven't had the best experience with bounty hunters, so she told me about you and your friend in advance. She said that neither of you would do any harm to me.”

I quickly connected the dots. “You're a fugitive? We're already tracking one outlaw down, we don't need a second-”

“Ex-fugitive,” she corrected. “I was an outlaw many years ago, but I grew tired of it all and served my time. To put it poetically, plants need water and sun to survive; not blood. If Espathra hadn't warned me, I would've tried to, well...” She stopped in her tracks, looking ashamed. “I would've tried to defend myself.”

I tried to think of a way to calm her, and combing through recent memory, I hatched an idea. I tried to smile as best as I could, even though I felt tense from knowing of this woman's past life. “My partner would like you, if he wasn't drugged out of his mind right now. He thinks there's good in everyone, and he'd be happy to meet someone who left the sort of life you must've lived. I used to think all outlaws were scum, but he showed me that some still have some good left in their hearts. You just need to know how to nuture it.”

The tension faded from Sonora, her the cheerful mask she donned becoming more genuine. “Thank you. Truthfully, I dunno if I can ever redeem myself for what I did back then, but I do what I can. Every time I give someone in this town flowers, I can feel the weight on my heart lessen for just a moment. As for your friend...” She seemed to perk up almost instantaneously. “I'd hug Makuhita, but I wouldn't wanna poke him!” The Maractus giggled to herself as she began to move towards a part of her garden, with me following close behind. Approaching some flowers, she gestured towards some weeds that had sprouted. “We need to get rid of these. It'd be gruelling work for most of the other Pokemon here, but we're both strong, aren't we?” I gave a thumbs up in response to her question, and we began our work.

Pulling weeds wasn't as intricate and precise as pottery, nor did it require as much patience, but I had to be careful not to damage the numerous flowers Sonora had planted. After our work was done, she invited me inside her home. As I sat down, she entered another room. I could hear her rummage through something, and when she returned, she was holding a bizarre-looking seed. Its base was round and in a shade of white similar to that of an eggshell, with pink dots spread horizontally around its middle, and a heart in an identical color affixed to one of the seed's ends.

“Well, Asana,” Sonora began, “I want to give you this. It's a Life Seed. It's very, very rare, and for a good reason! Not only is it unable to be cultivated or found in most dungeons like lesser seeds, but it can heal a Pokemon from grave injuries your garden-variety Orans cannot!”

My eyes widened in shock. She was giving me something as valuable as **this**? “I cannot take that,” I said. “That must have costed a considerable amount of Poke. You don't need to give me this.”

Sonora smiled at me. “Well, I *want* to give this to you. I try to be honest about who I was, but you're one of the few Pokemon to give me a chance so early after learning about my old life. Plus, this might save your buddy's life somewhere down the line, and I think the world needs more Pokemon like him. Heck, “Sonora” isn't even my real name!”

I took the Life Seed cautiously, eyeing and pocketing it. “What is your real name, then?” I asked.

“I don't have one!” She replied. “Although, the first alias I ever had was “Merry”. That was the nickname my ex-husband gave me. In fact, he was my partner back when I was still an outlaw. We robbed wealthy folk and caravans, mainly.”

Sonora sagged, the vibrancy she had before completely sapped from her. “He used to be the sweetest man. We both grew up in the Thirsty Desert, and our tribes hated each other. To make a long story short, his tribe wasn't native to the Sand Continent, and took some of my tribe's land a couple hundred years ago. They still point fingers at each other to this day, but neither of us cared about a grudge no one left was even alive to see begin.”

The Maractus made an effort to steady her breathing, continuing to recount what happened. “Neither of our peoples approved, and we had to run. At first, we robbed Pokemon because we had to, in order to survive. In our homeland, the number one rule is survival above all else, so stealing came easy. We became pretty good at it, although due to our infamy, we had to keep stealing in order to stay afloat. I was better with words than he was, so I navigated the criminal underworld, and would sometimes visit towns in disguise to gather intelligence. I had dozens of different masks; false identities I'd use to keep hidden, although I was always “Merry” to my husband. The one thing from those times I miss was all the dressing up and acting I had to do. It was fun.”

At this point, Sonora was struggling to hold herself together. “In our line of business, taking lives is inevitable, but the two of us reacted very differently. I dreaded it; hated it like nothing else. I took the utmost care to prevent death when I could, even at cost to myself. My husband, on the other hand, became desensitized to it. Even though we lived in less hostile lands, he still clung to our home's old philosophy. Towards the end of our time together, I quit being able to hold it in.”

The Maractus began to cry. “I told him everything. I told him about the burden on my heart, and how terrible I felt each time I was forced to take a life. I tried to remind him about who he once was, and said I was scared of what he would turn into. He told me that he was going to stay where he was, and that if I couldn't stomach what had to be done, that I should leave.”

Sonora remained silent, struggling to muster up words. The pain she felt was clearly painted upon her face as though it were a canvas. “I took his suggestion. He was crying sand as we made our separate ways; it was probably one of the last times he ever felt anything in that heart of his. The only thing I have left of him is a Gold Ribbon he pilfered once. He had one that matched, too – it was our signifier of our marriage, since we couldn't have a ceremony.” She looked downwards. “I had to start hiding it after Thievul began his robbery spree. I dunno what I'd do if I lost it.”

I wasn't used to feeling empathy, doubly so for someone with a background like Sonora's, but I felt awful watching her break down. A small part of me chided me for sympathizing with her, yet I muffled it, getting up from my seat and slowly walking towards her. I awkwardly embraced her, her uncontrollable weeping slowing down. I never thought I'd see the day where I hugged someone – I never done so before today, not even to my own mother. I waited until Sonora was done sobbing, and then backed away a few steps. “T-thanks, Asana”, Sonora said. “You're a good Pokemon, and a good friend.”

I felt a bit sick from the phrasing she used. “That's funny,” I replied. “Makuhita said the same about me, even though I don't believe it myself.”

The Maractus let out a weak chuckle. “You should have more faith in yourself. I've met plenty of nasty customers, and you don't fit that bill at all.”

Sonora and I spent the rest of the day together, with only the setting of the sun making me retreat reluctantly to Espathra's home. Even if I still didn't understand the methods behind her madness, I was starting to enjoy her tasks. 

##Day 3 – The Sourdough Supremacist
To my annoyance, Thievul hadn't hit any homes lately, although a couple Pokemon have sighted strange footprints that would appear over the night. One of his victims recognized them as the same one on the card they were left, meaning he was still in the area. Yet, I wouldn't mind staying here if he leaves. It'd allow me to get to know the Pokemon I've met here better, and maybe I could receive the same training Makuhita was going through. I probably wouldn't need the vile liquid she had been dosing him with, as I had plenty of experience with Aura as it stood. 

Today, I was supposed to meet Mienfoo, a local baker. I entered his shop, the scent of freshly baked bread pervading the area. I approached him, and was met with an unusually intense glare. After a few moments, his gaze softened as he waved over to me. “Welcome to my bakery!” He said cheerfully. “You here to buy some bread, or are you ordering something special?”

I shook my head, and displayed the badge Espathra gave me. “No. My teacher assigned me to work with you. Just give me something simple. I've never cooked before.”

Mienfoo stared at the badge, as if he were sizing it up. His demeanour then flipped like a coin yet again, the baker bounding towards me and shaking my hand. “Well, since you were sent by one of my most faithful customers, you're more than welcome in my kitchen!” He began to drag me to the back of the store, giving me zero pause whatsoever! “Come along, miss, we've got a lot of work ahead of us!”

Mercifully, he let go of me as soon as he entered the kitchen, instead electing to retrieve a jar from one of the cabinets. He opened it with a smile on his face – it almost looked prideful. Why would he be so proud of a mere ingredient? As I came close enough to peer into contents, things became even more strange. It was a thick, strange-smelling mixture of *something* with bubbles in it; its mere presence made me uneasy.

He quickly picked up on how unnerved I was by the stuff in the jar, chuckling to himself. “You silly Meditite,” he chided me. “You look like you had a Joltik crawl into your bed!”

I mustered what courage I had, and began to speak out. “What in the world **is** this, Mienfoo?” I asked. “It looks like slime! How in the world are you even going to use this slop?”

My harsh words caused my teacher for the day to glare daggers at me. “It isn't slop,” he replied. “It's my family's legacy, and you should address it with respect.”

A bead of sweat dripped down my face. “I understand, but I genuinely do not know what that is, how it is edible, or how it'll even contribute to making something edible.”

Mienfoo's mood rebounded, a glimmer of joy in his eyes. “Well, it's starter, for sourdough! Bread needs to rise somehow, and there's multiple ways to do it. Some Pokemon use barm and those in larger towns use soulless baker's yeast,” he begins to explain. “Some **DIRTY HEATHENS**, however, use Fidough breath, but who in the world would want to eat bread that got breathed and slobbered upon by a mutt during the mixing process? It's disgusting and unsanitary!” He shouted with venom and ire in his voice.

Mienfoo took a few moments to breathe, calming himself down. “Ah, sorry. I just have no respect for Fidough-lovers. Anyway, my family's always used sourdough, which is the objectively superior form of bread. You wanna know why?”

I nodded nervously.

My teacher grinned wide. “Well, I'll tell you why. The starter's is a living thing in of itself – you gotta feed it regularly, or it'll die off. It absorbs the love and care you put into it, and the environment it grows up in gives it an unique character. It's kinda like a Pokemon, in that way, and no two starters are alike. My family's been tending to ours for generation after generation, going back to the earliest records of Redkiln's existence, and maybe even before that, so...” Mienfoo trailed off.

“Sorry for getting mad at you, but you gotta understand!” He pleaded. “This mother dough is the lifeblood of countless generations of business, joy, and craftsmanship. It's pretty much an extra member of the family, as cheesy as that sounds.”

“I can see that,” I replied. “You put as much zeal into your work as any master of the martial arts. Now, what are we making?”

“Bread!” He said. In a burst of speed, he retrieved various measuring cups and tools from the cupboards, alongside a sack of flour. He then dragged me over to a basin of water, and forced me to scrub my hands clean. “You don't want to get any filth in your food! That's what muttbread-loving troglodytes do, and that isn't okay!”

We dried our hands, and then, it was time for work. Warming up a bowl of water, I added some of the starter followed by flour, the amounts being dictated to me by Mienfoo. I mixed it by hand until he gave the order to stop, the bowl being covered after. He told me we would have to wait briefly, and that he'd alert me when it was time to resume our task.

I cleaned my hands, and then began to process the numerous passionate rants Mienfoo went on. I could glean the hidden meanings and lessons that the other Pokemon imparted well. Polteageist taught me to take pride in my work, even if it wasn't perfect at first, and it's the journey that counted more so than the goal. Sonora revealed that the world wasn't always black and white, and to always look beyond the surface of things. Even though she was covered in scars, used to rob people blind, and undoubtedly left behind a few bodies, she was still good deep down. Maybe even her ex had a bit of his heart left in him, but I couldn't say for certain, as I didn't know him.

I felt as though I was on the cusp of a realization, but Mienfoo interrupted me – it was time to add the salt. Again, he helped me measure it, and I mixed it into the dough. To my annoyance, we had to let it rest for a second time, but deep down, I knew that patience was important. It was, to my knowledge, a universal trait that united all craftsmen, no matter their discipline. It also gave me more time to try and find the meaning of this excursion.

As I pondered, phrases Mienfoo used stuck out to me. The mother dough's environment gave it its identity. It takes in the love and care a baker gives it, and needed to be fed and tended to regularly. I thought back to when I first met Espathra, and what she said about me – my aura was plain. One's experiences help shape it, and one's bonds helped to nurture it. At last, I fully understood the reason for her assignments. I wasn't deaf and heard it the first time, of course, but I was incapable of comprehending the importance and meaning behind it. As weird as Mienfoo was, his obsession gave me the final piece of the puzzle.

Discipline, hard work, love for others, and love for yourself – those were the ingredients needed to create a true master. As I basked in my accomplishment, I felt Mienfoo tap me on the shoulder. “What're you looking so proud for?” He asked. “We aren't even done yet, c'mon!”

He dragged me back to our bowl. The next step was to stretch the dough up, fold it over on itself, and let it sit again. We did this repeatedly, and during our last break, I began a conversation with Mienfoo.

“I know I mentioned this before, but your work feels oddly reminescent of martial arts, in a few ways,” I began.

“I sorta figured you were a tough gal with that scar on your eye,” Mienfoo replied. “What makes you say that?”

“It's in the character traits baking needs,” I replied. “It's in the patience needed to craft the dough properly; the technique needed to manipulate it correctly. How long did it take until your knowledge became instinct?”

“Quite a while!” Mienfoo replied. “It took me helping my papa bake when I was growing up, and a few more years after that. I still miss him, but he'd be happy to see me carry on his legacy. Speaking of baking, it's time to finish your loaf up for the day!”

My final task was to shape the dough and fit it inside of the bread pan, which was effectively trivial in comparison to what came before. We had to wait overnight for it to rise, so I bought some bread for Espathra and left. I spent the rest of the day wandering around town, although I didn't talk to other Pokemon that much, save for a few brief encounters. I figured that's how I'm different from Makuhita – he wanted to socialize with and get along with everyone, while I preferred to keep a small amount of friends close.

It was surreal referring to the Pokemon Espathra assigned me to as “friends”, but they certainly felt that way. I'll miss them once our team moves on.

##Day 3 Interlude – Sharpening Sight
Makuhita drank down the beverage that Indeedee prepared, Espathra standing by them both. Makky felt an initial wave of nausea that he easily weathered, his vision swimming as the world around him became a kaleidoscope of color. If he hadn't sat down, the sensation would've knocked him to the ground, just like the first time he tried it. “Breathe deep and steady,” Espathra commanded. “Clear your mind.”

It was hard trying to still the waters of a mind as active as Makuhita's, but that's what Espathra's concoction was for. It sharpened his senses to a painful degree, causing him to have to go every waking hour with a headache. He had to meditate every day from the moment after breakfast, and his progress was slow. After a few hours of that, she took him outside to a part of town, exposing him to a new portion of Redkiln each and every day. Indeedee tagged along as well, although his inclusion was rather odd. Espathra could use her Sensing to see around town just fine, so what was he doing with her?

Makuhita couldn't do what Asana did yet, but he needed to. Hitmontop shown him that he was ill-equipped to deal with anyone with any modicum of skill or speed. He was a meatshield, but what good was that in a fight? Anyone smart enough would catch on to the fact that his companion was the true threat. All he was at the moment was a time-waster, and that needed to change. 

“Count the bricks on that house, and tell me the total,” his mentor ordered. Makuhita walked around the home she pointed out and took tally of each and every one. This was the second component of Espathra's improvised training routine – Makky had to take account of everything in his surroundings, from the Pokemon walking by, to the numbers of leaves on plants and bricks making up buildings. All the while, everything around him was covered in a smear of hues akin to a filter on top of his normal vision. Anyone who wasn't in Makuhita's shoes would likely laugh at this idea of training, but he had to keep his mind active and eyes open until the evening, while he was wracked by migraines!

He gave Espathra his answer, only for Indeedee to telekinetically lift Makuhita up and slam him into the ground with full force! He wasn't there to stop his wife from being tricked - he was there as negative reinforcement!

"You were off by seven," Espathra stated.

“Hey, at least he's improving!” Indeedee replied. “Yesterday, his best score was off by fifteen!” The day's training went by without much incident. To Asana's relief, Makuhita's appetite returned during their evening meal, although due to the Band he wore, he didn't devour nearly as much as he should have.

##Day 4 – Loose Ends
Breakfast was calm, mainly due to the fact that Makuhita wasn't an early riser. After I had my tea and daily berry, I walked outside with my mentor. “Before you assign me anything, I would like to tell you something I've noticed,” I requested.

“Well, whatever it is, do go on,” she replied.

“I know why you've been giving me these tasks now. It was only because of Mienfoo that I could truly grasp the meaning behind your words; the portion of your mindset when it comes to the links a practitioner forges with others. It's a lot like a good sourdough, which if you've been around him, I'm sure you've heard about before. You also chose those three Pokemon for a reason, didn't you?” I asked. “They all had lessons you wanted me to learn.”

She nodded. “Precisely. Everything has a hidden subtext; a concealed meaning if you look past appearances. You can find things to learn in the most subtle and inconspicous of places. I can use the Sight to detect the most minor changes in Pokemon and in the environment, and one day, I'm sure you will, too.” Espathra unfolded one of her wings, and used it to pat me on the head. “The world we live in is an amazing and intricate place, Asana. Looking at the mere surface of it is a disservice to what lies beneath. A book's cover can be deceiving. Camoflauge can conceal that which wants to remain hidden; masks can hide what one truly feels and thinks. I think you already know what you must do today.”

I smiled at her. “Yes. I need to finish the bread Mienfoo and I started, and I must also see if my bowl with Polteageist is completed.”

“Then go out there,” Espathra replied. “You've come far. Be proud of it.”

I first went to the kilns, and tracked down Polteageist. I retrieved my bowl from him – it was a bit crude, but it was a nice shade of green. It was pretty to look at, in spite of its flaws. I took it back to Espathra's, placed it on my bed, and then went to Mienfoo's bakery.

My work started with scoring the bread. I cut a line across its length, which Mienfoo told me would help it rise and bake better. At his insistence, I also scored a small mark into the bread – a Meditite's footprint. It served to mark the creator of the loaf. All that we needed to do now, was actually bake it.

The baking went by rather uneventfully. I checked on it a few times until it was done, and when it was, I withdrew my bread from the oven, and allowed it to cool. As I waited, Mienfoo looked at me. “So, what're you gonna do with it?” He asked.

“I don't know,” I said honestly. “I already ate today, so I can't consume it myself. I-”

The baker slapped me. “You aren't going to take a taste of your own creation? That's the dumbest thing I ever heard! It'd be like you training all day, then refusing to fight an actual opponent! It's cowardice at its finest!”

Mienfoo's words irked me. If he was going to call me a coward, then I was going to prove him wrong! “I'm not a coward, you militant nutcase!” I screamed. “I am going to take this loaf down to my friend Sonora, and we're **both** going to eat it!”

Hearing this, he teared up. “W-what'd you say? T-that is-” Mienfoo practically began to bawl his eyes out. “Sharing your food is the highest form of love you can give it!” He squeezed me so tight, it felt as though he were crushing me to death! “I'm so proud of you!”

“Let me go, please,” I pleaded with him. Releasing me, Mienfoo blushed a bit. 

“S-sorry. I can't help but get worked up sometimes,” he said. “It was just so moving, seeing you make such a bold decision. If you ever want to hang up your belt and work with me, I'd be proud to have you.”

I nodded and took the loaf of bread, making my way to Sonora's home. I knocked on her door, but she didn't come. I could sense her Aura inside, but it felt unsettlingly different. “Dulled” was the first word I'd use to describe it, but there was more to it than that I could not put into words. After a few moments, I felt her walk towards the door, and open it.

She looked like a wreck. She was clearly distressed, and I could see tears streaming down her face. “Asana, I-I don't think now would be a good time to talk,” she said.

“What happened?” I asked.

“It's my ribbon...” Sonora trailed off. “It was stolen last night, while I was sleeping. The thief left a card with a footprint on it.”

I could feel a burning sense of rage build up within me. Not only was Thievul brazen enough to predate on this entire city, but he took something as dear and important to my friend as that ribbon? He probably only saw it as something he could pawn off for a few grand, and knew nothing of its real value! I was going to hunt him down myself if I had to, but right now, there were more important things to worry about.

“That's the outlaw Makuhita and I are after,” I replied. “When I catch him, I'll make him deliver your ribbon back to you **myself**, although that isn't why I came here today.”

I showed her the loaf of bread I brought. “I came here to share this with you. I made it myself, although I had Mienfoo give me instructions. You do know who he is, yes?”

Sonora nodded. “Oh, you had that kooky baker help you? We can eat it inside, if you want...”

I entered her home, the both of us sitting at her table. Using a knife, she cuts the bread into slices, both of us each getting one. I took a bite of my own, and the taste was great, at least compared to my normal fare. It felt as though this town was tempting me to give up my way of life at every turn; trying to seduce me into becoming a replica of Makuhita, but there was a middle ground that could be reached. I could still continue to eat once a day after this, but it wouldn't hurt to vary my meals.

We ate in silence, Sonora only chiming in after she finished her bread. “This stuff's pretty good. Have you baked before?” She asked.

I shaked my head. “That was my first time. I'm surprised it turned out as good as it did, but I had a Pokemon who started baking as a child to help me out.”

The Maractus smiled weakly. “That's good. Has Redkiln been treating you well?”

“For the most part,” I replied. “The worst I had to weather was Mienfoo's mood swings, and even then, they're due to his love of baking. He's a very emotional Pokemon.”

Sonora giggled. “I've heard stories about him. I heard a Fidough tried to set up shop ionce, but he chased them out of town with a rolling pin!” She recounted. Her Aura didn't feel as weighed down as it was when I first came in, either. Perhaps I was distracting her from the pain she felt?

We continued to chat for a while, Sonora eating a couple more slices of bread and saving the rest of the sourdough for another time. When I finally left, it was almost evening. I hurried back to Espathra's, and arrived just in time for dinner. I, of course, resigned myself to merely drinking Indeedee's tea. We all spoke over dinner, and I heard of an accomplishment of Makuhita's. He sensed Aura for the first time, although it wasn't anywhere near close to my level of mastery.

He had to concentrate intensely for his sensing to work, and even when he did use it, he couldn't feel beyond an arm's length away from himself. He was unable to replicate the feat, but if I nagged him enough, *maybe* he could reproduce it. It was after learning of this, that Espathra offered something.

“Would you like me to read the future for you two?” She asked. “I wouldn't be able to do sentry duty tonight, but I trust you can pull an all-nighter, Asana. Indeedee spotted a faint set of footprints around our house, just like the ones other have been reporting, so your outlaw -will- strike this place soon. In fact, he might even strike tonight.”

I frowned at the realization that I'd get no sleep if I accepted, but then again, she could offer insight as to when Thievul would strike. “Sure,” I acquiesced.

Espathra stepped away from the dinner table, and I could feel the Aura in her body being channeled to her eyes – wait, when was I able to feel it out that precisely? My attention towards this new development was diverted as my teacher's eyes began to glow eerily; her breathing growing shallow, yet steady.

“You two will face much adversity during your time in this land,” Espathra began. “Death will loom over you like a shadow, following your every move. However, the fires you two light will keep it at bay. Your team will dethrone two kings, and the aide of the second will become your most bitter enemy. You will be chased away from the Sand Continent, and only barely make it to another. You'll lose the fame and fortune you'll build up, but in exchange, you'll find a true home, and a family. Once you find the four-leaf mark, you will know you have made it to safety.”

As Espathra's eyes began to dim, she snickered. “Oh, and don't worry about Thievul. You'll be the one to catch him, Asana, just be sure he stays that way!” With that, she fell to the ground.

Makuhita hopped up out of his seat in alarm and rushed to her side. “Ah, shit!” He yelled. “Essy, are you alright? C'mon, wake up!”

Indeedee calmly walked over to his wife. “She'll be alright; she just needs to rest,” he responded. “The two of you need to carry her to our bedroom, I'll show you the way there.” Makuhita and I lifted Espathra up easily due to the strength between us, her husband guiding us to their room. We placed her in a giant nest, which Indeedee said served as the bed for them both. As soon as I was sure she was okay, I exited their home and levitated up to the roof, beginning my nightly vigil.

##Day 4 – The Shadow Strikes
I sat there for hours, alert and waiting. I *wanted* Thievul to show himself, so I could teach him a lesson. It was late into the night, when I felt something, or rather, some*one*. The Aura was extremely muted; I shouldn't have even been able to notice it, yet for whatever reason, I had. I gently floated down from the house, and landed behind the source of the disturbance without a sound.

A brownish-orange, quadrupedal body was halfway through one of the windows of Espathra's home, and I could see a purple scarf – a Sneak Scarf, wrapped around the intruder's neck. I tugged on the scarf, removing it from their person and allowing it to flutter to the ground. Their Aura became brighter after this action as well, as if the piece of neckwear was muffling it. The Pokemon scrambled out of the window and turned around, and I was met with a very distinctive face.

It was vulpine in appearance, two tufts of fur towards the front of the snout giving off the impression of a moustache. An unmistakable natural eye covering resembling a mask revealed who it was immediately – this was Thievul, and I had caught him in the act!

![Busted.](https://i.imgur.com/2DllhQD.png)

“H-how on earth did you find me?” He stuttered out.

I stared him down, the outlaw flinching as my gaze cut into him. “You are either turning yourself in, or I am beating you to a pulp. I advise that you choose the wiser option.”

“No way!” He responded, retrieving something from a satchel he carried. He threw a seed with a bright orange eye shape on it at me. When it impacted, I lost my vision, and I could hear him scampering away. However, I could still sense his Aura just fine, and I began to chase him down using that sixth sense to illuminate the way.

Hearing the disturbances of the wind, alongside the sound of his footsteps, I was able to avoid the obstacles he used to try and gain distance from me. Since his initial attempts to gain distance failed, he instead elected to hop and climb from rooftop to rooftop, yet I had a counter to that as well.

By focusing deeply, I could float. I used the technique mainly for convenience, but during this night, I chased Thievul around like a vengeful spectre, finally cornering him on top of the tallest building in Redkiln. As I landed, my vision returned to me, and I could see a sight that brought great joy to me – he was exhausted, panting in an attempt to catch his breath.

“What's wrong? Are you not used to hunters who can actually keep up with their quarry?” I questioned.

“I-I don't know how you kept track of me, but I won't let my career end here!” Thievul stuttered, a bit of fear creeping into his voice. He retrieved a Wand with purple twine snaked around it from his satchel, looking at it as though it was his savior in his time of need.

It was then, that another anomaly with my sensing presented itself. Within the leg he was aiming with, I could feel his Aura flare. Then, he pointed it straight towards me, and just before he fired, I lept out of the way. A burst of the Wand's energy travelled forth, before it crumbled into nothing but splinters.

“Damn it!” Thievul cursed. “I'm getting too old for this... I'll just have to take you out myself.”

The outlaw took a moment to sharpen his front claws on the brick of the roof, and then, I could feel another flare-up in his hind legs. He lept forward, a dark energy building around his claws. I felt the Aura in his front left leg build up, and finally grasping the meaning of it, I dodged out of the way.

The flare-ups were “tells” of a sort. They couldn't perfectly predict Thievul's moves, but with my attention to detail, I could begin to dissect his fighting style as we fought. I had to go on the defensive due to his typing; a single Bite or Night Slash would've been the end of me. Yet, as I dodged, a pattern clearly emerged.

Thievul was a professional when it came to covering his tracks and retreating, but he was terrible at fighting. Even without the extra information reading his Aura provided, I could've figured out his playbook if I had relied on Detect instead. He gradually grew more frustrated at my dodging and, in his anger, threw a powder from his satchel. It got into my eyes, and it began to burn!

“H-how do you like that Blast Seed powder, hm? It serves you right for being such a pain to me!” He shouted.

I could hear Thievul grabbing something from his bag and chewing on it, before an explosive wave washed over me! I was sent flying back, only barely managing to hang onto the roof by a hand. As I finally opened my good eye, I saw my outlaw looking down upon me.

“I don't really want to do this. You might not make the fall, but I don't have much of a choice. You're too stubborn for your own good. Goodbye, you stupid Meditite, may we never meet again!”

The second before he could stomp on my hand, I used a burst of psychic energy to rocket myself upwards! Retrieving a Pounce Wand from my pack, I waved it towards the roof and warped behind my target. Thankfully, Makuhita was out of range, or he would've been drawn to it as well – Thievul had wronged me *personally* by stealing from my friend, and I didn't want my vengence stolen from me!

As Thievul turned around, I did something risky – I used Detect to read into the future, and channeled Aura into all four of my limbs. I could empower my arms or my legs seperately easily enough, but using all four risked me losing control over what I was manipulating. Yet, there was a valid reason for this gamble.

My bounty might've been terrible in terms of skill, but he was fast and unpredictable. If I merely empowered my legs, I wouldn't be able to strike him as hard, while defeating him quickly was of the essence. If I empowered my arms, my speed would be slowed down, leaving me a sitting Ducklett for his jaws and claws to tear into. It was only by going all-in, that I would be able to succeed.

Having read into the future, I dodged a swipe of Thievul's claws, which was followed up by a bite. He reached into his pack and chucked a Stun Seed towards me. I dodged out of the way, and with my limbs finally charged, I began to go on the offensive.

It was difficult, keeping them all empowered at the same time, but it allowed me a celerity that outpaced his, and blows that made him flinch when they landed. He tried throwing a couple more seeds at me, but I evaded those at well. Wishing not to be pelted anymore, I backflipped behind Thievul and ripped his satchel off of his person, throwing his toolkit down into the town below!

It was clear I vexed him. He uttered a primal scream, all of the emotions I brought out mixing in – anger, fear, and frustration, and charged towards me, what few combat tactics he employed being thrown out the window! His anger made him even easier to read, and I used this opportunity to chop at him with an empowered Brick Break, bringing the bruised and tired thief to heel.

I took some deep breaths, my coup de grace having burned through more of my reserves than I liked. Retrieving some rope from my bag, I tied it around Thievul's neck. I grabbed him and floated down from the building we were on, and once we were on solid footing, I kicked him lightly. “Get up. You will lead me to where your loot is,” I ordered. Getting up with some difficulty, the bandit hung his head down in defeat and led me to a collection of bushes, just outside of town.

I retrieved everything there, including the ribbon that Sonora had lost. “Are you gonna let me go now?” Thievul asked.

“No,” I replied. “I am going to take you to the house of the woman you stole this Gold Ribbon from, and you are going to give an apology to her. It will be a sincere one, too.”

I led Thievul to Sonora's house, and knocked at the door for a couple of minutes. I finally felt her aura moving from what I assumed to be her bedroom, to the front of her home.

She opened the door, wobbling in a slightly unsteady manner. “Asana, why're you knocking at my door in the middle of the night?” She asked, before she registered Thievul's presence. Her eyes widened. “Is that him?” She asked.

I glared at Thievul. “Apologize to her,” I barked.

He took a deep breath. “I am *sincerely* sorry for stealing your ribbon, madam. I will never bother this town again.”

I gave him a light smack to his face. “I could detect the sarcasm in your voice, you moron,” I scolded. “Apologize to her again, for stealing her husband's ribbon.”

“I'm really, really, really sorry for stealing your husband's ribbon,” Thievul said. “I hope you find it in your heart to forgive me for my horrendous crime.”

Sonora shook her head. “As an ex-criminal to a current one, I know you don't mean it, no matter how much flattery and appeals you sprinkle in. I'll forgive you if you work to actually reform, but I can tell from the way you're acting that you're too proud to. I'll get back to you after a couple rounds in prison, okay?”

I handed Sonora her Ribbon over, which she embraced almost like a lost lover, before she put it on one of the two growths on her head. “Asana, thanks for bringing my ribbon back home... I can't repay you enough.”

I grinned at her, a flood of pride and relief coursing through me. “I would've done it for any friend of mine,” I replied. “I'll have to give the rest of this dunce's stash to Espathra so she can redistribute the stolen goods back to their owners, and after that, Makuhita and I will have to leave.”

I sighed, my joy leaving my body as quickly as it came. “I hate leaving you and Redkiln behind, Sonora, but I'll always remember you all. Maybe I'll do as Espathra did, and come here once I retire myself.”

Sonora giggled in response to my words. “You can always come back and visit, silly! Besides, I'll come visit you two one day! I bet I could find out where you work out of, easy!”

I shrugged. “No need. We live in Sahra Town between bounties. News travels fast in port towns, you see.” After waving my prickly friend goodbye, I began my walk back to Espathra's as the sun began to rise. Today was a new day filled with new possibilities; new experiences and lessons to seek. All I had to do, was find them.
