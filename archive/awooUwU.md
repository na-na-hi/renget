Going to be honest. As a beholder of a blinged out Magic:The Gathering Werewolf deck any of those males could rape and kill me anyday, fucking woof Daddy, your pecs are gorgeous~
>go to a local card shop for Friday Night Magic
>see new face you've never met before, shy-looking guy in a beanie and messenger bag fiddling with some packs he bought in a corner by himself
>mumbling, seems he's sorting the cards into piles for pals to give to later
>notice he has a rare card off to the side, one the store ran out of several times due to its power. He must have pulled it from the packs he was opening
>you could really use that card to power up your deck for the tournament
>saddle up to his table, politely introducing yourself
>"Hey, I'm Anon. Never seen you here before, it's nice to meet you, -?"
>he shyly rubs the back of his neck. "It's Roy." He notices you staring at his rare card. "O-Oh, you saw this too? I really need it for my Werewolf deck..."
>you excitedly pull out your own deckbox, covered with werewolf stickers and paw prints. "Oh you love Werewolves too? I love their kind! So powerful and majestic on the battlefield. They'll swarm and beat your opponent in no time!"
>for some reason he gets really offended, his face showing how upset he is. ""Their kind"?
>you could swear you saw something pointy poking at the top of his beanie, like wolf ears, but this dude was human
>"How about you challenge me for this then? If you win you can keep it. If I win I get a free dinner from you."
>seems a bit odd to request, but you accept
>he beats you with little resistance, although there points in the match he seemed impressed with how you outplayed his moves
>you ended up going to a steakhouse together, way more expensive than what you would have imagined, but it was oddly cute seeing him tear into that meat
>You were going to leave after all was said and done
>however, as you were about to leave, Roy gently tugged at your collar, inviting you to come back to his place so he could show you more of his collection
>"Maybe you'll find something you like that I can give you~"
>he said that with a cheeky smile, like he knew something you didn't
>you had nothing else to do at this point since you spent the night together instead of playing at the tournament by yourself, so you obliged him
>a short walk later you find yourself in a bit of a run down home, the fence around the perimeter falling apart
>he ushers you in with a wave of his hand. "It might look a bit shabby but it's safe, heh."
>you follow him to his bedroom
>"So what sets do you like to coll-"
>You didn't get to say much more as you felt a muscled furry hand grab at your waist from behind
>A feral voice spoke out, his words jagged and grating against your ears. "I've got my collection right here, can't you feel it~?"
>you felt a vivid pulsation against your buttocks, looking down between your legs you see a throbbing pink canine penis
>Roy lets you go for a second, giving you the chance to look back at him as he strips off his upper clothing
>he's fully become a werewolf, jet black as the darkness itself, with his yellow fangs grinning at you
>"W-What the hell? Roy is that you?!"
>He gives you a nod, then reaches out his long paw to flick the lightswitch off
>you feel him pounce on you, his claws pushing you against the bed
>the moonlight illuminates his face as he smugly chuckles at you
>"How about it? You like werewolves so much, how about an actual battle with one?"
>you struggle, but are no match for him, feeling like helpless prey underneath him
>you see his red eyes shake back and forth as he cutely chides you. "Tsk tsk, poor Anon. I thought you could do better."
>Despite the circumstances, the overwhelming thought you have is the first reply you blurt out in response "I can't help it okay, you're really hot."
>Roy is shocked at your curtness, before he whips back to a mischievous grin.
>"Well how about that. Do I hear someone being all sweet to me already? We've only just met, but you're blushing over me and calling me cute."
>It was true, your cheeks were probably as red as your eyes. But that didn't stop you from wanting to be cocky right back at him. "Says the guy who put his dick right against someone he just met."
>Roy lets out a whistle in retort. "~. TouchÃ¨." He cups the back of your head with his hand, bringing his muzzle to your face. "But I'm not hearing a no either~"
>That time you definitely let your courage let itself get the better of you as you reach up with your free hand and slap him for that joke
>He giggles and rubs the spot, still looking down at you. "Well, I guess I have my answer then. Best not let the little puppy stay upset." He moves to get off you, but you grab his arms.
>"Wait. I want you, Roy. I want to feel the real touch of a werewolf. I've been too scared to go and try and find one, but... you're a really cool guy."
>Roy's eyes slant like one of those humorous expressions you see on the internet. "I don't know, I don't really like my partner to be this easy."
>You reach up and kiss him on the lips, wanting to feel his sloppy tongue inside of your mouth.
>Roy's ears stand straight up, then he leans into it and presses you down, removing your clothing one garment at a time.
>You two now lie naked in his bed, him still on top of you.
>Roy grins. "Well, don't say I didn't warn you, puppy. It might be a bit much for you to handle, but I bet you know that already~"
>And with that he wordlessly began the intimate ritual between you two, the last words coming to your mind before being entranced by the moment echoed:
>Let the Midnight Hunt begin.
