    "Here's the thing about primates that many people don't understand about humans and other primates, is that they are more separated then people think. I mean while mixed canine, and mixed feline houses and families are prevalent, and even mixed primates without humans exist, humans tend to stick to their own, at least historically. This is thought to be that, because humans aren't able to breed with other primates, they haven't mingled with them as much. Not only that they are in a bit of a league of their own, especially with the lack homo sapien species, we are instead left with only homo sapien sapiens". The professor paced at the front of the class, a fat old tom cat in kakis and a button up, sporting a tie as well.
     The Primate Studies professor looked to the whole auditorium "Like we have done at the begining of each unit let's see everyone's experience level, raise you hand if you have seen a human ever, including media." Everyone raised their hand.
     "In person?" One or two people put there hand down.
     "Met one? C'mon now, it's ok if you haven't." Around two dozen people put their hand down, including a gorilla named Ramsay sitting in the third row of the auditorium.
     "Know one personally?" After this less than half the class had their hands up, the few humans in the class looked around a little concerned.
     "Good..." The professor said "Now, you may have some misconceptions about humans, unconscious bias perhaps. Today we'll be learning about misconceptions about humans, please turn to page..."

     Ramsay was majoring in math, and minoring in Primate Studies, if not only because he thought it would be interesting and give him a break from numbers and symbols, but it was harder than he thought. While he wasn't to hyped about accidentally taking a history class after highschool. He was happy that he sat behind a human he thought was cute, but it meant he usually half listened to the lecture, and just read the pages at home and copied his friends notes after class, but he would break his usual routine today.
     The human, was walking towards him, Ramsay panicked 
     *What did my parents say about humans again? Oh god what did the PROFESSOR say about humans?? I think I'll just have to be really careful, I hope I don't embarra-*
     "Hey!" The human was standing right in front of him now, smiling, he was above average height for a human but the gorilla still towered over him.
     "Oh, uh, hey h-huma- er, sorry, hey... You, what's your name?"
     *Shit, humans really don't like to be refered to by spices right?*
      The human was used to it, while Ramsay internally panicked trying to remember how to talk to humans, the human responded, unfazed, used to this by now.
     "Uh... I'm Alex. hey! I was wondering if you knew where the- hey wAIT!"
     The gorilla hoisted the human into his arms
     *Humans like dominance right?* He thought.
      "Can you put me down?" Alex asked.
     "Uhhhh," Ramsay paused for a moment before shakily saying, "N-... No? In fact, I'm, claiming you! Yes, I'm claiming you as my human boyfriend."
     Alex's face was dead pan at the clumsy ape.
     "Hey, wait a second, I know you!" Said the human suddenly "I asked you for a pencil last week? In our Primate studies class? Did you not pay attention at all to today's lecture?"
     "Well, no, well kinda," said Ramsay "I usually just, copy the notes after, because I, I'm to busy looking at you."
     Alex was a little surprised "Oh, well, thanks! I catch myself looking at you too..." He thought for a moment before saying:
     "Well," he said "How about this, you put me down, and at 6:30 tonight, we go to a movie, and that'll give you plenty of time after classes are over to read up on humans, how's that sound?"
     "Oh, uh, yeah! Can I get your number so we can talk more about this? I need to get go?" Ramsay didn't expect this to work as well as it did.

     Ramsay arrived at the theater early waiting for Alex, he was really excited, they greeted each other when Alex entered the theater.
     "Hey hu-ALEx, hey Alex." A few people turned to look at the pair but while Ramsay felt a little self conscious, Alex paid them no mind.
     "Still learning I see..." He said with a warm tone with hints of sweetness, which wasn't helping with the perspective that all humans were bubbly, and feminine, but he could help it with someone he liked.
     "Yeah," Said Ramsay, "What movie did you want to see?"
     "Oh, uh... Shoot I didn't think about that, hmm, let's watch..."
     They ended up picking some random action movie, neither of them were really here for the movie, so it didn't matter. Neither of them even wanted food, so they both got their tickets and got to their seats, making conversation about nothin in particular. After the movie started, they started to closer, leaning against each other, then Alex coaxed Ramsay's hand into his own. Then they shared a long look into each others eyes.
      It all felt so fast up until now, but he fully accepted when Alex went in for the kiss.
     Ramsay was at a loss, this human had stunned the gorilla in front of him that was 3 times his size.               
     "Oh, wow, I, ok"
     Alex only giggled, both got plenty of dirty looks from people actually trying to watch the movie. Alex shut him with more kissing, though this didn't mollify the rest of the movie goers, but they didn't really care to "get a room!" At the moment.
     They sank into each other, the epitome of young love (or lust maybe?) in action, focusing only on each other.
     After the movie, they walked in the parking lot with eachother, holding hands.
     "Hey, that was great, but that was fast don't you think?" Said Ramsay.
     "Well, maybe," said Alex, looking up at Ramsay, "But it was nice, do you... Want to do this again? preferably over a nice dinner?"
     "Only if we can kiss like *that* again?" He chuckled, "But seriously, I'd love to!"
