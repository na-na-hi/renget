The Pokemon Mercy Seat
--------------------------------
It all began when they took me from Hoenn
And put me in the switch generation
A place for which I'm totally incomplete, you know
And a crime for which I am totally innocent you know
 
I began to warm and chill
To Dynamax and Terastalization
A ragged cup, a twisted mop
The legends of Arceus in my soup
Those sinister dinner deals
The curry trolley's wicked wheels
A hooked bone rising from my food
And all things either good or ungood
 
And the mercy seat is waiting
And I think my head is burning
And in a way I'm yearning
To be done with all this weighing of the truth
A dexit for a dexit
And a DLC for a DLC
And anyway, I told the truth
And I'm not afraid to die.
 
I hear stories from the chamber
Our Champion will be born into a shire horse's saddlebag
And with the holy desire,
She will survive inside the fire
Might I say it seems so fitting in its way
She was a McDonald's frycook by trade
Or at least that's what I'm told
 
My Nintendo Switch tattooed E.V.I.L.
across my DS's stylus
That filthy five!
They did nothing to challenge or resist
 
In Heaven His throne is made of gold
The ark of His Testament is stowed
A throne from which I'm told
All history does unfold.
It's made of steel and sapphire
And my body is on fire
And Arceus is never far away
 
Into the mercy seat I climb
My head is shaved, my head is wired
And like a Venomoth that tries
To enter the Rayquaza's bright eye
I go shuffling out of the current rhymes
Just to hide in death a long time
And, anyway, I never lied
 
And the Mercy Seat is waiting
And I think my head is burning
And in a way I'm yearning to be done with all this weighing of the truth
A dexit for a dexit and a DLC for a DLC
In any way I told the truth
And I'm not afraid to die
 
And the Mercy Seat is burning
And I think my head is glowing
And in a way I'm hoping to be done with all this twistin'
of the truth
A lie for a lie
And FOMO in for FOMO
 
And, anyway, there was no proof
And I'm not afraid to die
 
And the mercy seat is glowing
And I think my head is smokin'
And in a way I'm hoping
To be done with all these looks of disbelief.
A dollar for a dollar
And a memory for a memory
And I've got nothing left to lose
And I'm not afraid to die
 
And the mercy seat is smokin'
And I think my head is melting
And in a way that's helping
To be done with all this twistin' of the truth
A Dexit for a Dexit
And a DLC for a DLC
And, anyway, I told the truth
But I'm afraid I told a lie...
