###Popsy Agency
Inigo looked up from his phone. Gigan was curiously hovering over sleeping Hoge as she stirred. Inigo's gaze softened as he watched Hoge's chest gently rise and fall, her delicate features relaxed in slumber. Even with messy bedhead and a tiny puddle of drool dampening her pillow, she was still the most beautiful girl he'd ever seen. She looked so cute and peaceful all bundled up, sleeping with her arms stiff at her sides, her dark bangs fanned wildly across the pillow. Occasionally her quirk would blur her outlines, and she would mumble a word or two. He tried to guess her dream. He wondered if he was in them because she was definitely in all of his. 

Gigan mewed protectively, as Inigo raised a hand to brush her hair back. It wasn't like he was gonna risk waking her up, but he would watch her all day if he could. And why not? They could use a break after Popsy's challenge yesterday. They had exhausted themselves cleaning up. Even awesome Yui and stoic Chihiro were disgusted by the state of the bathroom they had to share. His smile widened, remembering how fiercely determined Hoge had been, guiding everyone to help deep clean Popsy's chaotic apartment. They had tackled every inch of the living room and the bathroom until it was sparkling. Well, as clean as the place could get anyway. Enough for them to sleep on. By the end of it, Kaga was so tired that he dented the wall just by leaning on it.

Inigo suppressed a chuckle. His strong-willed Hoge didn't handle their mentor's reveal well. She had been extra grumpy at Popsy. He was determined to make today absolutely perfect for her. Starting with whipping up a sweet gourmet breakfast! Hoge usually woke up early, so he had to hurry. Inigo heard a squeak, and he turned to spot Popsy's pet rat, Janna, sitting by the corner, beady eyes looking at him curiously. 

"You'll watch her for me, will ya girl? I'll be right back."

Careful not to disturb Hoge's rest, Inigo tiptoed silently out towards Popsy's kitchen. Along the way he spotted Sally curled up on the lumpy couch, phone in hand. She must've woken up while he was taking a shower. Her tired face was lit up brighter than the rising sun outside, a ridiculous smile plastered across it.

Inigo's grin turned wicked. Crouching behind the couch, he popped his head over Sally's shoulder.

"Whatcha smiling at McCathy?"

He heard a clicking gun noise. "Jesus, Inigo!!" she hissed, fumbling to hide her phone screen. "Don't sneak up on me... Ugh, it's too early to have to deal with you."

Cackling, Inigo vaulted over the couch and made an exaggerated kissy face. "You were texting our sweet angel boy, weren't ya? I know he wakes up at the same time as me. So any progress there? C'moooon, tell me all the juicy deets!"

If looks could kill, the one Sally shot him would've slain instantly. She fumbled her phone. "Sh-shut up! I'm just telling him about the internship," she hissed back, a faint blush on her cheeks. "He's going off on a rescue trip today."

"With Localoca? Lucky!" Inigo glanced at Sally's groggy half-asleep face and smiled. {"If you're worried about him. He'll be fine. He won't get hurt like last time. We'll fly out and save him if he gets in trouble,"} He shot her with finger guns. 

{"Ugh.. It's too early to deal with you. I'm going to take a nap...I only got up to wish Noah good morning back."} Sally turned away from him.

Inigo lit up. "I knew it! You lovebirds are so cute it's sickening." His tone turned singsong. "Don't mind me, just send him my best! Tell him I can't wait to be the best man at your wedding."

He narrowly dodged the pillow Sally chunked at his head. He chuckled. Young love really was too fun to tease. Though he probably shouldn't poke that bear too often...Sally would straight up murder him one day if he wasn't careful. Still grinning, he slipped out onto Popsy's balcony for some fresh air. Down below in the apartment courtyard, he could see Kaga already doing morning laps. Gotta respect his hustle to be training this early, Inigo mused. His muscles ached at the thought.

Humming cheerfully to himself, Inigo began rifling through cabinets for ingredients. He couldn't wait to see Hoge's delighted face when she woke to a heavenly spread of chocolate chip pancakes, fresh fruit, and maybe fluffy omelets...

"Let's see what we've got to work with," Inigo muttered, as he and Gigan scanned the chaotic contents of the fridge. His face fell instantly. Lining the shelves were various unidentifiable milk containers, plus a jar of mysterious rainbow liquid labeled "Joy Juice - DO NOT DRINK." Gigan took a sniff only for the construct dragon to melt dramatically into a puddle. Not a single edible ingredient in sight. 

Inigo groaned. Why did he expect anything different? Giving the cupboards a cursory glance yielded similarly disappointing results—mostly ancient snack products long past their expiration dates. There wasn't even a working pan! Inigo sighed, running a hand through his hair. “Alright, no problem!” Inigo declared, hands on his hips. “We’ll just make a quick supply run to the corner store.”

***
***
Inigo stepped onto Popsy's balcony once more. He focused on his quirk. Gigan responded instantly, morphing and shifting to engulf his body in a suit of brilliant green armor. Gleaming metal scales rippled down his arms and legs, meeting at the chest plate emblazoned with Gigan's roaring crest. With a flash, wings of verdant hardlight unfurled from the armor's back.

Inigo grinned, flexing his gauntleted fingers. "Let's fly, buddy! Let's go fast before everybody wakes up!" Leaping from the balcony, his wings expanded and he rocketed upwards. Powerful sweeps of the glowing wings sent them soaring.

The fading night sky was just beginning to brighten as Inigo soared high over the city streets on the back of his glittering dragon construct. Soft dawn light filtered over the clustered buildings, highlighting Kyoto’s blend of modern highrises and traditional architecture. Inigo gazed down at the crisscrossing streets as they emerged from shadow. Delivery trucks rumbled out from warehouses, starting their daily routes. Early commuter trains glided swiftly along rails, weaving under stone arches and bridges. Highways wound between the towering skyscrapers, still largely empty this early without the usual choked traffic. He knew why Junichi was so worried about Kyoto. It was an amazing place.

Puffy clouds tinged pink and gold by the rising sun drifted lazily around Inigo. The cool morning air felt refreshingly crisp in his lungs, but right away he noticed control issues. Gigan was straining full throttle, nearly deaf to directional commands. They shot higher at reckless speeds, city streets blurring hazardously below.

Inigo winced as his wings heated and rattled erratically. Gigan had been extremely temperamental lately since the fight with Envigor. He thought soothingly, "Easy buddy, stay with me!" Inigo winced again. Gigan was redlining, nearly deaf to commands in its excitement. He poured all his focus into mentally reining the overload of power. “Steady there!” He can already see the store below. His wings dived. Just before a disastrous crash, Inigo managed to wrest back control. He pulled sharply out of the dive, hitting the brakes. His armored feet touched down in the narrow alley behind the store with only the slightest stumble. Inigo blew out his cheeks in relief. Gigan chirped apologetically, folding its smoking wings. 

"It's fine. I can tell you're trying too, pal. Popsy had an idea on how to fix ya. Until then let's stick to normal speed, alright?," he said, smoothing his windswept hair. He'd have to get control back fast. He couldn't let Team Popsy down again after yesterday's clown challenge. 

Round the alley, Inigo sauntered inside the 8/12 convenience store and made a beeline for the egg shelves. He scanned the prices and his upbeat whistling halted abruptly. His wallet held only a few crumpled coupons and masses of pocket lint. “Aw man...we're flat broke!” Inigo groaned. "I don't suppose you have money?" 

Wide-eyed Gigan opened its toothy mouth and inside was a 100 yen coin. "Great. We'll all share a pack of gum for breakfast."

So much for buying ingredients. Looked like he’d have to improvise some more.

###Kraftwerk Agency
Inigo strolled casually through the high-tech halls of Kraftwerk Hero Agency. This place was way fancier than Popsy's run-down apartment or the chaotic Shiketsu dorms. Gleaming training rooms with state-of-the-art equipment branched off the sleek corridors. Inigo whistled, impressed. Maybe he should've interned here too. Following the sounds of exertion, Inigo located the gym. He poked his head inside to find his bros Hifumi and Bobby already hard at work under the watchful eye of the pro hero Impakt. They were wrapped up in an intense jiu-jitsu session on the mats.

Inigo leaned against the wall, content to just observe for now. Impakt began leading Bobby and Hifumi through a series of advanced jiu-jitsu techniques, while his sidekick Floor served as uke.

"Today we will be honing your ne-waza skills," Impakt declared. He pointed to the mats. "Hifumi, mount position if you please."

Hifumi plopped himself down directly atop Floor's chest, controlling the sidekick with knees pinning his arms.

Impakt nodded. "Excellent kesa-gatame. Now observe closely."

He knelt and demonstrated a complex wrap of Floor's nearest arm. With a final twisting motion, he leaned forward and squeezed tightly around Floor's elbow.

"This gyaku-ude-garami armlock utilizes both arms to entangle and control your opponent's elbow. Either tap or suffer a broken arm."

Bobby let out an impressed whistle as Impakt maintained pressure a moment longer before releasing the technique.

"The key lies in angling their wrist down into your other arm," Impakt explained further. "Now you try Bobby."

Soon both interns were drilling the advanced move under Impakt's watchful eye. 

 "Well executed. We will continue expanding your ground game after breakfast." Impakt clasped both of his intern's shoulders firmly with a rare smile. "I expect even sharper technique then, young heroes."

Inigo chose that moment to step fully into the gym. "Epic lesson guys! I'm impressed!" 

The trio turned in surprise. Bobby's face split into a huge grin. "Well slap me sideways, it's pretty boy!" He leapt up to exchange one-armed bro hugs. "Whatchu doin' all the way over here?"

Hifumi nodded in greeting. "Yo bro, what's up?"

Inigo laughed. "What, I can't stop by to visit my best bros once in awhile?" His expression turned dramatic. "Plus I'm on an urgent mission for ingredients to make my darling a special breakfast! Was hoping to beg some eggs and other stuff from your fancy agency kitchens."

He shot Impakt his most pleading sparkly eyes. "You'll help a guy out, won't ya Chief?"

One corner of Impakt's mouth quirked upwards slightly. "But of course. Proper nutrition is crucial for good hero work!" He started towards the door. "Allow me to prepare a full spread myself. Can't have you serving subpar fare."

Inigo jumped in front eagerly. "Really?? Aw man. I hear your cooking rocks. We had to eat pizza for lunch AND dinner yesterday."

Impakt held up one gloved hand. "Ah but, the eggs won't be parted with so easily. I cannot let them leave these premises. I insist on overseeing their preparation." He crossed his massive arms, immovable on this point.

Inigo frowned. "What? But it was gonna be a surprise back at Popsy's." Then his eyes lit up deviously. "Bobby and Hifumi said they were available for trainees so......I kinda already took the eggs." He shrugged. "I promise to make it up to ya guys! Call it an IOU for the Popsy agency! Ganbatte on all the grappling!" Inigo began to glow green.

"Huh?" Floor looked at the blonde boy. "What's going on..?"

Hifumi ran a hand through his hair. "It's not him, sensei."

"Yeeeah, Inigo does this all the time," Bobby said chuckling.

"C'mon, kid. You're welcome to joi-" Impakt grabbed for 'Inigo', only for Gigan's construct form to vanish. 
***
Outside the Kraftwerk Agency, the real Inigo whooped triumphantly as he flew upwards with a dozen eggs and a pack of butter, "Thanks for the help, guys!" He saluted the Kraftwerk Hero Agency. Laughing, he jetted off. He had to leave quickly before he can get anything else, but surely someone else would loan him the other things he needs.

###Seiryu Underground Hero Agency

Inigo pulled out his phone as he approached and flew over the nondescript building housing Seiryu's agency. Now how does he get in again?

Scrolling through his contacts, Inigo tapped Imai's name to shoot him a quick text. 

>**IniGOAT**: yo dude im outside seiryu's secret base what's the knock sequence so orochi doesn't sic her hydras on me?
>**ImaSoujyuuro**: Third window from the left, tap Big Butter And Egg Man rhythm.
>**IniGOAT**: peak choice - the kinda dixieland swing im looking for, sparkleman
>**ImaSoujyuuro**: That's the secret sauce, baby.
>**IniGOAT**: music's so good, even the jukebox nods in approval - u busy?
>**ImaSoujyuuro**:  Getting a fresh cut from Honoken-senpai. Remember me for my blues, brother.
>**IniGOAT**: the maestro of soul can never die
>**IniGOAT**: hang in there

Inigo chuckled. He made his way over to the specified window and rapped out the silly knock sequence. After a moment the glass pane slid open revealing Orochi's face. The silver-haired girl blinked in surprise before recognition set in.

"Inigo? There you are," She undid the lock to let him inside.

Stepping into the sleek facility, Inigo grinned. "Heya Orochi! Just on the hunt for breakfast ingredients." He noted happily how much more confidence she carried herself. He was glad his 1-D twin was doing better. Even her hydra quirk's heads bobbed along cheerfully rather than snapping irritably like before, except one of them was chewing on a lego piece.

Shrugging, Inigo followed as Orochi led the way down the hall towards Seiryu's main office. Peeking inside, Inigo could see the dragon pro hero observing critically as his hot sidekick Honoken gave Imai's hair a trim. Imai had been thinking of growing his hair out like a true musician. Inigo felt for his soul and jazz brother.

"A little more to the side," Seiryu instructed.

"Is this really necessary, sensei?" Imai sighed, resigned.

"Absolutely. An underground agency is no excuse for unkempt appearances."

Nodding to Inigo, Seiryu chose that moment to address his sidekicks, handing Honoken a stack of documents. "Now then, today we will be reviewing hero law and joint operations protocol. It's important to get you two some field work experience." Next to Seiryu, two mutant attorneys with rubix cube heads silently worked on paperwork. As he launched into an explanation of cross-agency regulations, Honoken shuffled through the attorney's paperwork with a small frown. "Huh, any reason why your suggested agency partners are all female heroes. Yoshizumi, Flamingal, Ryukyu, Thirteen..."

Seiryu looked away. "That's...purely coincidental..."  The mutant attorneys glanced at each other and shrugged.

Honoken just smiled. "Uh-huh, sure thing boss."

Inigo hid a snicker at the hero's attention to detail. 

Orochi gave Inigo a questioning look. "So, what have you all been up to so far with Popsy?"

"Oh, y'know, usual stuff! Picked out wacky clown costumes yesterday. Good fun!" Inigo laughed. "Can't say we've done any planning yet."

"Really? Seiryu had our entire schedule planned out long in advance."

"Oh yeah? Bet you guys have covered way more than us already then."

Orochi leaned into Inigo with a dramatic whisper, behind her one of her tails tried to take a swipe at Gigan. "Did you know Seiryu-sensei was Shiketsu's class representative for both his sophomore and senior years? No wonder he's so organized with lesson plans." She tilted her head curiously. "Do you think Nyoro-chan would have preferred interning with us instead?"

"Hmm. Maybe." Inigo frowned slightly. He studied the pro hero with new appreciation. Hoge would've thrived here with the perfect structure... 

Forcing a cheerful grin, Inigo gave Orochi a thumbs up. "Whelp, Imma grab some pancake mix and berries for my mission! Good luck today, Atsushi-san!"

Orochi grinned back. "You too! Say hi to everyone for me! Tell Yui I'll call her later."

Inigo waved to Imai, still trapped under Honoken's scissors. He make his way to a small pantry area to gather ingredients. Now he had all the ingredients he needed. As Inigo left the agency with supplies in hand, he felt a small pang of guilt. Selfish as it sounded, he was glad Hoge was at Popsy's agency with him instead. He definitely didn't want to lose her to Seiryu. Which meant he needed to work harder so she wouldn't regret staying.

"Alright, we got everything! Let's go, Gigan!"

He was utterly determined now to make today 100% perfect for his beloved Hoge!

"Crap.. We forgot to get syrup and a pan!"

Inigo frowned as he texted Christopher to see if Ryusei's dojo was available.

>**IniGOAT**: yo bro, how do you get to your dojo?
>**LookingGlass**: why? I'm not there
>**IniGOAT**: damn, I needed to borrow a skillet. can i fly over and grab one?
>**LookingGlass**: You know what.... I'm not really sure he has one.
>**IniGOAT**: where u at?
>**LookingGlass**: Im patrolling with Smokin
>**IniGOAT**: wtf it's like super early
>**LookingGlass**: i know right??
>**IniGOAT**: lmao. have fun then! ill try someone else bro
>**LookingGlass**: thx

Well, there goes his reason to see Christopher. He looked through his phone list solemnly. They were all seperated. It's been two days and he already missed having 1-D together. Shinkan and Kaylee were both in Osaka with Saurus. Noah was off in a rescue trip with Localoca. The clique would be in Korea by now. Who knows were Ashleigh is. Her internship just keeps changing. She's probably in the sewers training or something. Orbit and Tame-chan would be with Rosethorn. They're probably stuck in Shiketsu. Hiro's still recovering....and then there's Sandy who- His phone buzzed.

>**BicycleGrampa**: Is this the right number?
>**IniGOAT**: wtf
>**BicycleGrampa**: Young man, we need to talk.
>**IniGOAT**: who gave u my new number
>**IniGOAT**: and whats with the name
>**BicycleGrampa**: Your friend Marrow was kind enough to provide it.
>**BicycleGrampa**: As for the name, Eri entered it
>**IniGOAT**: lmao im coming over 
>**IniGOAT**: u guys better have a skillet
>**BicycleGrampa**: ?

####The Horrific Five Hideout
Inigo flew above the dusty road towards the safehouse that served as the home base for his uncle's men, the line of tea houses and old houses now served as the temporary base for the Horrific Five. From a distance, he could already hear sounds of combat carrying on the wind. Sure enough, rounding the building's corner he spotted Junichi locked in intense fight training with the tall, massive dark-skinned woman known as Maddox.

 Though harsh in her methods, Inigo detected a glint of protectiveness in her eyes. 

"Again," Maddox commanded, holding focus mitts up an instance. "The cross hook combo this time." Brow furrowed in concentration, Junichi delivered a crisp one-two punch. 

"Good. Now with hip rotation. Harder!"

She slowly demonstrated, engaging her core and driving her back leg through. Junichi copied the movement, noticeably increasing force.

"Excellent! Remember to keep your guard high. Use that quirk of yours or this is gonna hurt!"

Maddox plowed a savage kick towards his shoulder, Junichi fell to the ground. But his bone quirk erupted from his elbow in time to block. "I can take the pain," Junichi growled. Chest heaving, he forced himself upright.  She towered over him, features stony yet eyes glinting concern seeing his worn state. "Good. Then let's keep at it, kid."

Inigo winced as he noted Junichi's battered shape. "Dang dude, she put you through the wringer huh?"

"He’s doing well," Maddox remarked "Here to join the bootcamp, Daiichi-kun?"

Inigo smirked nervously. "Thanks but I got my own mentor. I'm just here for Sam," His grin softened taking in Junichi swaying on his feet. "Maybe ease up though? Gotta leave my bro in one piece." Inigo shot Junichi a subtle thumbs up which he wearily returned.

Leaving them to it, Inigo headed inside the safehouse itself. There he found Desolator, the weathered leader of the Five, pouring over an old notebook and writing profusely. He had learned of Desolator's transformation from the clan. Behind the grizzled veteran, the other three members of the Five lounged on musty couches watching TV.

Inigo eyed the mercenary leader up and down. "Sir, if I didn't know better I'd say you were getting younger."

Desolator didn't crack a smile. "Let's skip the games today. We've got a situation that requires your input." He nodded towards the room's far corner. Inigo followed his gaze to the bound and gagged man squirming there against his restraints. He was Japanese, middle-aged, clad in a nondescript gray suit - and marked with a telltale tiger tattoo along his neck. Inigo's amusement faded. Right, this was business then.

The light left Inigo's eyes. He purposely disconnected from his quirk, he needed to see without Gigan's interference. His voice came out flat and cold. "What's the situation?"

"Well, young man. You better sit down." The leader of the Five debriefed him.

According to Desolator, a smaller family, the Hagiwara Family, had sent an assassin, one Fujita Osuke; A lowly grunt even in his own family, to kill eighteen members of the Chinen Seiwa family as they ate at a ramen joint. A hit this large was enough to get the whole Nakamura clan, big and small families, gathering, hungry for blood. The Hagiwara deny their involvement with Fujita and were willing to fight over the accusation.

Inigo listened intently, fists clenching. He looked through the stack of papers on the table. Eighteen people were dead. Three of them were children. A whole family was gone in an instant. And that blood needed to be repaid. He knew that part of maintaining the Daiichi was keeping the smaller clans in order. 

Desolator eyed him carefully. Was this a test? The veteran already knew the right answer, he just wanted to hear it. 

Inigo knew he could talk to the clans themselves. That had always been Luccione's job. Even without his quirk, Kaz was a seasoned mediator. He had a knack for getting people to do what he wanted in those gatherings. Inigo could already hear the patriarchs spitting back and forth with each other. Claims of sabotage, calls for blood, pinkies, cement blocks, yada yada. It was always the same, like walking into a high-school drama.  But this powderkeg could set off unchecked bloodshed across all groups if he didn't intervene quickly. 

Jaw hardened, Inigo met Desolator's scrutiny. "The Hagiwara is a very old family, and they've never been loyal to the Daiichi. They're looking to cause problems to move up. How many people do they have?"

Desolator's expression darkened. “They're small. They only have double digit members. I can’t see a reason why they’d do something this rash...unless they have a backer. We can only go off what we know, which sadly is very little.”  

The Hagiwara had always liked Luccione. Was this his doing? Inigo looked at the bound man. "Who knows. They have a backer, or they're willing to join another clan." He nodded towards Fujita Osuke. "Make him talk. We need solid proof the Hagiwara ordered the hit. Do whatever you need to do. If they did do it, then tell the Nakamura I'll ride with them personally and the Five will be coming with me."

"It'll take time extracting that truth from our 'guest' there. What are your orders to stabilize tensions in the meantime?" Desolator said without looking up from his notebook, in his Gigan-less state it annoyed the hell out of Inigo. It was like talking to an older Christopher, when he's busy jotting things down.

 Inigo took a deep breath and reconnected with Gigan, instantly his anger faded. He waved a hand flippantly. "Yeah, I'll do what Kaz did and handle it. But first..." He moved towards the sparse kitchen area, rifling through cupboards. "I got pancakes to make."

Desolator frowned. "Young man, there's also the matter of protecting your family's territory. Your uncle is still unavailable, and I'd rather deal with you than-"

"You don't like Gorou huh? He's alright. Kinda greedy. Where is he anyway?" Inigo replied breezily, not slowing his search. 

"He's off collecting. Tell me how would you like to proceed? Surely, you have some plan." He could feel Desolator's gaze drilling into him now. 

Inigo considered the question carefully this time. "I'm actually gonna leave this one to you. I'm busy doing my hero internship." 

"Then we have your full clearance then."

Finally Inigo met Desolator's scrutiny unflinchingly. "You have full clearance to proceed securing our assets as you deem necessary." His expression darkened. "But Christopher is off limits. I meant what I said when I called you on his birthday. Once he forgets me, there'll be nothing tying him to one of your employers." 

Inigo opened more chests and cabinets. "Jeez, do you guys keep stuff that's not weapons and ammo? Why do you have so much propane? Nobody needs this much propane. Where are your pans?"

Desolator pinched the bridge of his nose in exasperation. "The skillet is in the right drawer." 

As Inigo rummaged distractedly through the kitchen debris, he gave a triumphant "Aha!" holding up a grimy, sticky syrup bottle in triumph along with a dented skillet. 

"So, we done here, right?" 

Desolator cleared his throat loudly. "One last matter - about your brother Satoru's coronation ceremony. It's for January back in Sendai. The Five's been instructed to accompany you to the gathering as security detail for the ascension."

Inigo's posture stiffened. "Oh yeah? Gonna drag me there in chains if I refuse the invite?"

Desolator's expression remained unreadable. "I sincerely hope such measures won't be necessary."

Inigo frowned, glancing over his shoulder. Tether, Nox, and Mercury had muted the television, turning to observe the exchange with fixed eyes.

Inigo plastered his grin back on with effort. "Ha well, we'll see what happens. Catch ya in the new year I guess!" Keeping his grip white-knuckled on the syrup bottle, Inigo wasted no time making swiftly for the exit. He had everything he needed for breakfast. At least this one thing was still in his control. Skillet in hand, Inigo pushed out into the sunlight. He felt a dull ache in his chest, but his flight back should cheer him up. He needed some air to clear the family business swirling through his mind, or else Hoge would notice something.

*Gigan. Let's go fast. We're running a bit short.* Verdant wings grew out of Inigo's back, not just one pair but three.

###Popsy Agency
Inigo coasted to a stop atop Popsy's balcony, ingredients piled precariously in his arms. Stepping inside her apartment, he spotted Yui getting up and Chihiro neatly folding her futon.

"Morning Mitsurugi-san!" Inigo greeted, relieved to see Hoge still softly sleeping across the room. "Ready for round two with Popsy today?"

Chihiro glanced his way, eyebrow raised subtly. "Good morning Inigo-kun. Where were you so early?"

"Oh y'know, picking up stuff to make a banging pancake breakfast!" Inigo chuckled. "After the leftover pizza last night, I bet everyone's hungry. Speaking of, how's your hangover treating ya? You don't feel too bad?."

Chihiro tilted her head curiously, "What is a 'hangover'? Why would drinking make me unwell?"

Inigo blinked, then grinned slowly. "Ha, guess you're just built different!" Glancing at Hoge's sleeping form, "Hoge's still out cold, huh?"

"Yes, you should be careful not to wake her," Chihiro said simply, before picking up a towel and heading to the bathroom.

"Wouldn't dream of it!" Inigo smiled. "I'll just put this stuff away."

Inigo hummed to himself as he carefully prepared the kitchen, haphazardly stackings all the ingredients before turning to heat up the pan. Behind him Gigan untilted the falling ingredients and seperated them. He has to remember to get everyone back for pitching in with the ingredients. Probably should've picked up some money too. What if he threw a big pancake party? His train of thought is interrupted as he heard a gargling noise followed by the indistinct sound of a mouse squeaking for its life, he turned to see Hoge at the sink, frantically running her head under the gushing faucet.

Inigo paused, whisk dangling forgotten in hand. Morning sunlight filtering through the window caught in the water droplets and cast a ethereal glow around Hoge's face. Bedraggled as she was, to Inigo she shone transcendant in that moment - she looked like a goddess.

"Good morning, Coru-chan," said Inigo brightly. "Didn't expect you to be the last one awake."

As she finally surfaced, slack-jawed and blinking, Inigo drank in her wide dark eyes as she blurred. There was a hundred things he wanted to say, but words failed to form. His heart skipped.

"I'm making pancakes! How many do you want?" 

"Three. Rat?"

####Bonus Scene:

###Shiketsu Academy

It was lunchtime at Shiketsu. The bustling cafeteria was abuzz with the chatter of students enjoying their midday meal. At one of the crowded tables sat four boys - Inigo, Sandy, Bobby, and Hifumi. "Alright, let's try this again," Inigo said enthusiastically. He turned to Sandy, who sat blank-faced, methodically eating his food. "Foxtrot!"

No reaction from Sandy.

"Sunburst!" tried Bobby. Still nothing.

"Red sun!" said Hifumi. Sandy continued chewing, unperturbed.

The three boys exchanged glances. Then Inigo leaned in closer to Sandy. "November November."

Sandy blinked slowly, then took another bite of his sandwich.

"Aw man, I really thought that would do something," Bobby grumbled.

Hifumi frowned. "Maybe we need a full sentence. Sandy, listen to this - There are three flowers in a vase. The third flower is yellow."

Silence. Sandy sipped his drink.

"Junebug!" added Inigo.

Sandy wiped his mouth with a napkin. "Nope, none of those are working. Want to try again after I finish eating?"

The three boys slumped back into their seats, discouraged.

"This was your idea, Inigo," Hifumi complained.

"Hey, it made sense in the movie we saw!" Inigo argued.

Bobby sighed. "Maybe we're going about this all wrong. The phrase is probably something more subtle, to avoid drawing attention."

The boys pondered.

"Oh, I know!" Hifumi said suddenly. "It's gotta be some ordinary phrase like 'have a nice day' or 'lovely weather'."

Inigo nodded eagerly. "Yeah, that makes sense!" He turned to Sandy. "The maple leaves look lovely today!"

Sandy glanced out the window at the red and orange leaves blowing across the school grounds. "Yeah, fall is nice."

The boys groaned. 

Yui and Nene entered the cafeteria. Spotting the guys at their usual table, the two girls wandered over.

"We could hear you from the hallway. What are you guys up to now?" Yui asked bluntly, hands on her hips.

"We're trying to figure out Sandy's secret trigger phrase so we can activate his sleeper agent programming," Inigo explained.

Yui rolled her eyes. "That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard."

"Yeah, there's no way that's true," added Nene with an amused smile.

"That's what they want you to think!" insisted Bobby. "But trust us, we're gonna crack this case and be heroes for discovering the truth."

Hifumi nodded eagerly. "When we save the school from Sandy's sleeper agent rampage, you'll be thanking us."

Yui scoffed. "You really think saying some random word will magically turn him into a spy?" She turned to Sandy. "You don't actually believe these knuckleheads, right?"

Sandy shrugged. "I want to know if I'm a sleeper agent."

Yui threw her hands up in exasperation. Nene laughed softly patting her on the back, "This is kind of fun, like we're in a spy movie or something. What if the magic word is 'blue cabbage'?" she suggested playfully.

Suddenly, Inigo, Bobby, and Hifumi stiffened, their backs going ramrod straight. When they spoke, it was in terrible Russian accents.

"Comrades, we have arrived," droned Hifumi. "It is time to take over Shiketsu."

"Yes, for Mother Russia!" added Inigo.

Bobby looked conflicted. "Well I'm still American, but I guess I work for Russia now too. Let's roll out, sleeper agents!"

In awkward, jerky movements, the three boys stood up from the table and began stiffly marching out of the cafeteria like robots.

Yui's eyes went wide. "What the hell? They were joking, right?" She turned to Nene in alarm. "Should we stop them?"

Nene was too busy laughing at their over-the-top performance to respond.

Even Sandy had gotten up from the table and was shambling after the other three, arms rigidly at his sides.

"Not you too!" Nene grinned, grabbing Sandatsu's hand. "Come on, you can't actually think you're a secret agent right?"

Sandy paused, then shook his head. "No, but it looks fun. I want to join them." He gently tugged his arm from Yui's grasp and continued his robotic march after the others. Yui turned back to Nene, exasperated. "This is so dumb." Nene was giggling too hard to provide any reassurance. Sighing the two girls watched the bizarre scene continue to unfold, wondering how far the Boys would take it this time.

Off in the distance, Principal Karaburan yelled loudly.
