>you're 'Non Mono
>a name you'd chosen for yourself on short notice after being abducted by cool aliens
>who couldn't render your real name in their encoding.
>These days you've taken advantage of the surprisingly transferrable skills you learned playing video games
>to become a crack pilot and smuggler
>of both above board and legally dubious cargo
>nothing that'd make the trade federation call for your head on a platter though
>you've been running with a co-pilot for most of that time, a few centralized sidereal cycles, probably about six months on earth
>an alien with the uncanny characteristics of a black bear from back on earth
>round ears and all
>you'd swear he was one if it wasn't for two things
>he walks upright and talks just fine
>and he has exactly the opposite build you'd expect
>lithe and light on his feet with an effeminate roundness by your earthly estimation
>his name is "Dreughbachcus"
>he didn't get why you laughed so hard the first time you heard it
>you usually call him Drew
>he says the way you pronounce the rest is like nails on a chalkboard to him
>actually he said it was like the call of a horny mahguol
>apparently that's bad
>you're on a contract to smuggle federally legal "aphrodisiacs" to a planet called andross 32
>there really were 31 other planets named andross under the federation
>space pizza must be bitch to get delivered
>the stipulation of "federally legal" is a sticking point
>on andross that shit's 110% illegal
>worse than anything you'd ever imagined on earth
>that means it's big money
>and mostly low risk
>mostly
>MOSTLY
>just don't think about what a life sentence means
>on a planet that has no polite words for intercourse
>in any language that ever developed there
>drew keeps telling you that even if worst comes to worst
>you'll both never see the inside of a cell
>andross is already on thin ice with the federation

>they're not on board with the federation's policies of free speech and unimpeded transit of goods
>and definitely not on board with the policy of "free fraternization"
>androssians make the westboro baptist church look tolerant and polite
>at least they acknowledge sex for the purpose of procreation
>there are no favorable records of homosexual relationships in androssian records
>mythological or otherwise
>barely any that are favorable about heterosexual ones
>almost entirely exclusive to the domain of myths and legends
>countless stories of prisoners of war
>sentenced to be "made women" as an insult to the enemy nation
>by criminals who were sentenced to death
>no wonder these bugs fetch such a high price
>moratellian "lust" mites
>the pun is your own doing
>one can send a member of just about any species into a mating frenzy
>you've got two
>they feed on hormones and release pheromones
>or was it the other way around
>galactic standard speech doesn't distinguish between them
>clearly the androssians need them
>whoever they're for will probably be the happiest and most fulfilled people on the planet
>they're in a small glass ampule full of pink inoculating nano-vapor
>drew thought the pink kind of gives it away
>it would be way easier to get through customs if it were blue
>da ba de da ba di
>you enjoy hitting him with references he can't possibly understand
>customs actually wasn't a problem
>that repressive society means they have no fucking clue what it is
>holy shit what do you tell them
>uh
>it's a space epipen for drew's space malaria flare ups
>the customs agent asks
>epipen? that's not some kinda ESS TEE DEE, now is it son?
>that's the word they call you out on?
>nope
>drew "helpfully" blurts out
>and it's not an illegal aphrodisiac either
>you've got to figure out how to get him to stop doing that
>it worked though and you're through
>to the planetary capital andross 15
>it's the only one
>it's just been rebuilt 14 times

>you're tasked with delivering the mites
>to a "speakeasy" smack in the middle of the city
>which is really a "sex club"
>which means "fertility clinic"
>which actually means "quasi-legal hidden sterile room for the purpose of theocratically approved shameful emotionless procreation"
>yeah
>these people need the mites
>the speakeasy is located directly under the giant autocratic government seal
>in the absurdly large main square
>it just so happens that today is the most important androssian holiday
>if you could call it that
>it's a hundreds-of-thousands strong gathering of citizens
>worshipping the concept of chastity
>and celebrating their authoritarian government
>for freeing them from "The Necessary Agony"
>no one in the galaxy but the androssians themselves know what that actually means
>how the hell are you going to:
>A. get through this unfathomably large crowd
>B. get UNDER the giant object they're all praying and chanting towards
>drew acts like an ignorant tourist
>pulling you through the crowd and bumping people
>and paying no attention to the fact that there's something very important and sacred happening
>like you're trying to cut through straight to the other side of the plaza
>holy shit
>it's working
>it worked, actually
>now you just need to figure out which paver to press to get in
>no you don't
>drew's celebrating too early
>he just spiked the ampoule like a football
>an action you admittedly taught him
>SMASH
>fuckfuckfuckfuckfuck
>the nanovapor just made sure both you
>and your increasingly more irresistible partner in pseudo-crime
>each got one of the mites
>~FUCK~ ~FUCK~ ~FUCK~ ~FUCK~
>you're overtaken by an unnatural wave of primal desire
>your dick has never been so hard
>drew has already somehow managed to peel himself free of his single piece elastomer bodysuit-thing

>you saw the vapor hit drew
>but if there were any doubt
>it'd be gone now
>he's on the ground totally naked, at full mast
>and he's spreading his high-contrast pink ass wider than can possibly be comfortable
>you're practically pulled to its waiting tenderness
>your face goes straight in
>without taking a breath
>you HAVE to get it lubricated. NOW
>your tongue reaches greedily as deep as you can force it to go
>what little control you have over your overheating mind and body
>goes to making sure every single pliant, elastic surface and fold is covered in a mix of your saliva and his sweat
>it's like your life depends on it.
>the cute, vulnerable, girly noises he's making >force you into a painful state of near-priapism
>It's only been about 30 seconds
>you come up for air
>and rip down what you usually referred to as your "militarized khaki slacks"
>right now they were just "in the way"
>the state of your dick would scare you
>if you were in any state to care
>about the fact that it's redder than normal
>and your veins have veins
>all you're in right now is drew's asshole
>which feels like it's waited an eternity between your last encounter
>the tightness with which he's gripping your shaft is unnatural
>aggressive
>desperate
>there's no expectation or rendition of gentleness
>as you slam your pelvis into drew's sufficiently round backside
>this is all just to make the force that's torturing you both, in a hideously euphoric fashion, relent
>even only for a moment
>the sounds coming from your black bear boy are only making it worse
>your mouth meets his in an attempt to stop the excessive shocks of pleasure
>one of your hands leaves its leverage-granting position on his butt
>to squeeze greedily at his cock
>if what he's going through is even close he might not even need your help
>but it's not for him
>it's for you
>as your tongues search aimlessly around each other for purpose and sensation

>whatever supernatural force must have seen fit to create these damned mites
>it finally decided to let you out of it's clutches
>the friction between the both of you was finally sufficing to grant you relief
>there had already been a huge volume of precum that ran freely from drew's dick
>and splattered freely from his asshole with each of your thrusts
>but finally the sensation that you had been longing for for what felt like hours
>signaled that it was over
>as ropes upon ropes of your cum were projected into drew
>more than had ever come from you before
>his own followed almost instantly
>absolutely showering him
>standing out as perverse pearlescent streaks in his black fur
>your senses return to you shockingly quickly as you realize what you've just done
>federation be damned you both might get the death penalty
>It'd be worth it
>then you realize
>for a crowd of hundreds of thousands
>it's totally silent
>as if every single person in it was at rapt attention the whole time
>one of the androssian rock-bug men speaks up
>is that all? where are the wounds? the Ichor?
>another says
>is that how they do it? that's it?
>another, probably one of their women says
>that's why they're so casual about it. I must say I'm jealous
>what
>the massive crowd produces a deafening cacophony of jeers as they turn to form an angry mob
>directed not at you and drew
>who's still senseless, slack jawed and drooling beneath you
>but at the massive autocrat's palace
>the mass of bug-people charge in the fashion of a particularly well coordinated tsunami
>they crash effortlessly through the massive doors
>they drag out their chitinous theocratic-god-king
>who had been waiting on the other side in his vestment-regalia for the signal to proceed with the ceremony
>he's literally ripped to pieces
>you actually turn away
>you check on drew, who's now coming around
>he asks "what the fuck happened?"
>a couple minutes ago you would have told him he'd gotten you both killed

>apparently the government had been exploiting and perpetuating the misconception
>that all people in the galaxy shared their misfortune
>reproducing by traumatic insemination
>and that there's nothing that can be done to ease their burden
>that explains the "Necessary Agony" thing
>even the men got hurt in the process
>the androssian government has known better for countless years
>they deliberately chose to let their people continue to suffer
>for tax benefits
>and "Elevated Autonomy"
>no wonder King Tin Pest was treated so brutally
>you can't even imagine what it's like to be lied to like that
>on that scale
>for that long
>the federation liaison comes running up to you both, now just barely decent
>I should issue a federal condemnation of you two right now
>you'd take that over what you'd first expected
>It'd mean a few years out of this business
>and a permanent black mark against you
>that'd be an improvement over torture to death by knife-dicked bugmen
>but seeing as what you've done is clearly very politically volatile
>we'll detain you and see how this shakes out.
>shake out it did and the majority of androssians have come to consider you as heroes
>who've given them access to effective medicines
>and the ability to reproduce without it feeling like a punishment
>this status essentially forces the federation to award you diplomatic honors
>usually reserved for treatymakers and first contacts
>for horribly irresponsible sex acts in public
>you're officially quoted for the records saying
>we've given the androssians A New Hope
>drew got that one
>you've used it on him too many times
>no one else did
>they'll figure it out if earth ever gets its shit together
>you now have a hell of a story to tell at the cantina between jobs
>and a romantic relationship with a decidedly non-bear black bear
