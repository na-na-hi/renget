>Suisei and Hoshikawa are good friends with you and each other during elementary
>your families move to different parts of the country and you lose track of each other
>they become stacies while you become a cute but nerdy and shy kind of guy
>you end up going to university together
>a happy reunion turns awkward as Hoshikawa and Suisei both develop a crush on you while you remain oblivious
>Suisei knows Hoshikawa is more conventionally attractive and better at flirting
>she proposes a mutual agreement to avoid getting into a relationship with you if possible
>Hoshikawa declines
>"Let's let Anon choose...surely neither of us would be jealous of the other's happiness, right?"
>smugface.gif
>Summer is here and Hoshikawa asks you about going swimming at a lake, Suisei insists on tagging along
>Suisei knows what a shamelessly skimpy bikini Hoshikawa will wear to show off her curves, Suisei can't compete on that front
>she picks an elegant, undersized black swimsuit with frills and little star decorations
>hopes that you'll value the elegant implications of tight spandex over almost-naked tits and ass
>meeting at the lake, the tension between them is palpable
>Suisei and Hoshikawa subtly present themselves to you
>except you're oblivious and feeling like you're only good enough for the friendzone
>you're naive enough to think that they don't notice you sneaking peeks at both
>as they're competing for your male gaze with all kinds of shenanigans, you suddenly hear a voice from afar
>it's your other elementary school friend: Aqua, the dumb tiny girl who found out about what you three were doing
>she's still short, but as she comes running closer everyone can see that she has become the most stacked shortstack in all the land
>anewchallengerapproaches.jpg
>her big milkers are barely contained by her striped bikini, flopping from her neck down to her tummy while her dumpy jiggles behind her
>Aqua giggles and jumps at you
>hugs you tightly with her tits squished against your bare chest
>Suisei and Hoshikawa look at each other, then at your face, then at your suddenly-stretching swim shorts
>ohshit.png
>you have the time of your life playing in the water with Aqua, she giggles and screams as you lift her, press her soft body against yours and toss her around
>Suisei and Hoshikawa try to get in on the action, but quickly recognize that they can't really compete
>both think about how to get Aqua out of the picture for a bit, but come to the conclusion that it's a chance not worth ruining all the friendships over
>they sit on their towels and talk for a while
>Hoshikawa apologizes for her earlier attitude, Suisei tells her that both should have been better
>they go back into the water once you and Aqua have calmed down a bit and bond with her
>you're too happy to notice the change in Suisei's and Hoshikawa's attitudes, already thinking about your first date with Aqua
>Aqua doesn't quite understand her own or Anon's feelings yet, but is happy to finally have female friends
>everythingisfine.gif
>days pass, there are many plans for group activities and also a first date between Aqua and you at your place
>Suisei is more and more happy for Aqua and Anon, she gets over her crush 
>Hoshikawa feels mostly the same way...except she is also reconsidering her stance on polyamoury
