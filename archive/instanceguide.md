How to host a meetup and create a public link to your instance on VRChat:

1. Go to https://vrchat.com/home

2. Click on "Worlds"

3. Click on the world you want to host your instance in

4. Scroll down, select the region and privacy level of your instance. If you are hosting a NSFW meetup, select invite+ or invite only

5. Click "Launch"

5. Copy either the link in the URL or short link from top left

6. Paste into the thread

7. Launch VRChat, then once in your homeworld, click "Invite me" on your instance link.

8. Accept the invite. You should now be in your own invite+ instance, and others will be able to join if they have the link!

8. Alternatively, click launch world, if you don't have vrchat open at the moment. May cause some issues with ovr advanced settings and other steamvr addons?

Note: When you are the owner of your instance, you can kick people from your instance by going into the social menu and clicking on them, then clicking on "Moderate User".
