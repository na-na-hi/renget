Things are only scripted so far as the overarching production of these large streams.
Their script probably looks something like this:

I. Introduction (10 min.)
Fubuki: Kon kon kitsune! Domo minna! Today we're going to be raping OP with a strap-on!
Towa: Konyappi! Tokoyami Towa desu! I'll get the lube!
Korone: No way! OP's such a stupid faggot, he doesn't deserve lube.
Fubuki: Eh? Korone! Where's you're greeting?
Korone: I don't have one! Ano... Yubi! Yubi!
<Fubuki should explain why OP is a stupid faggot and he deserves to be raped.>

II. Main Segment: The rape (40 min.)
<Fubuki goes first and after about 10 minutes, should change places with Towa and then Korone.>
Staff note: We'd normally go with senpai order, however we feel that Korone is more likely to be the most intense and cruel, so she should go last.

III: Wind down (10 min.)
<In order, each member should talk about how how it felt to rape OP, and the others should react to what they say.>
<At around 55:00, Fubuki should announce the new "Raping OP" merch set while Towa and Korone occasionally chime in with their feelings towards the merch.>
*Example: Korone could exclaim how useful the rape towel is and Towa could say that she's impressed that the image of OP starts crying and bleeding from his anus when the rape mug changes temperature.
