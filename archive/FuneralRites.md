Distortion

Superhuman

>Perks
Unique Combat Style Lv3 (-30) - A style that focuses on making use of armaments spawned from her skeletal structure to target vitals, granting a quick death. When a strike lands properly it's said to be unnoticeable. Too fast, too precise, and lacking the malice usually associated with combat.  
Little Sun Lv2 (-25) - She is quite kind by nature, her only desire is to help others pass on peacefully. This kindness has caused a following to gather around her which she does nothing to dissuade. 
Backstreet's Ghost (-25) Silently traversing the night, a grim messenger takes what others have forgotten or would abuse.
Flesh is malleable (-30) - Often used in conjunction with her natural authority to repair damaged bodies, but she is quite capable of making fearsome monsters to assist her in protecting the dead.
Booksmart (-15)
The Wanted Mindset (-20)
Unnatural Emanation (-30) - A deathly aura. While it cannot cause a man to wither away with a touch, those affected will find slight cuts opening as they bleed profusely, skin bruising more easily, and bones snapping from lesser force than usual. Death comes just a bit more easily.
Extreme Survivalist (-15) - The City is a dangerous place, but she is an expert at navigating it to help those less capable than her. As long as there is something to be retrieved, she will find it.
Urban Movement (-15)
Seeing the Problem (-15) - A gift of questionable use to her as she is, but sometimes people come to her with pains beyond the flesh. It's not in her nature to ignore those who suffer, so she does what she can to soothe them.
Screw You! (-20) - There is nothing that could make her waver. Too many have suffered and continue to suffer.

>Distortion
Inhuman Form
Supernatural Aspect - She has great affection for the dead, seeking to give them proper burials. This manifests as authority over what remains of them in this world, manipulating her own form and theirs.
Blend In (-15)
Relatively Stable (-15)
Enhanced Aspect (-25)
Parasitic (-40) - The dead that she takes into her care become extensions of herself. This much is not a surprise, but those who mourn as she does may also be brought into her flock.
Crying Children (-70)
"Philip" (-90)
Accepting Oneself (-80)
Qliphoth Meltdown (-70) 
Distortion Fields (-40)
Black (-60)
- Fun's mastery over her domain has expanded she now serves as a beacon for the Dead and those who can still spare tears for them. Those who are close to their final rest can even hear her call out to them in a comforting voice, assuring them that they need not suffer any longer. The environment around her warps into a gate to the afterlife as she becomes both the mourner and all those who desire to be mourned.

>Weapons (+200)
[High-Quality v3] Ferryman's Scythe (-70) - The weapon of choice of a curious girl, integrated into her body. Aside from being supremely sharp, the weapon seems to seek out the shortest path to a target's vitals. Rumors say that its victims feel nothing but bliss even as their heads fall from their shoulders. For some, it has come to symbolize Death and is a thing to be feared, but for others, it is a tool of mercy.
>Armor
[High-Quality v3] Mourner's Dress (-50) - A beautiful black dress, appropriate attire for one who is always mourning. It has a calming, and somewhat saddening, effect effect on the minds of others. While not intended, this can throw off people's minds in combat as they further struggle to recognize her as a threat.
>Misc (+50)
Resting Place - A large, heavy coffin. While Fun can easily add more parts to herself, she prefers to retrieve bodies and relocate them. This Coffin excels at this as it's far sturdier than normal and has far more space than even its dimensions would suggest. Whatever falls inside stays fresh as well.
Moonlight Stones (-25)
Incense (-5)

>Body Enhancements(+180)
[Bio-IV] What Remains - If something is to fell the self-appointed reaper, it won't be through breaking her down. Her Ivory form will remain long after the City crumbles to dust. Her bones are equal to the most valuable of metals and as malleable as clay, making them excellent material for her powers to warp into whatever she desires. (-120)
[Tattoo-IV] Epitaph - Her skeleton has been engraved in a way that has her always primed for focusing her being onto a deathblow. Every attack makes use of all she can give, no matter the circumstance. (-60)

>City Laws
Lightful (+30)
Virtuoso (+10) - It is not in her nature to cause unneeded suffering. For her, death is an end to suffering and so granting a quick and painless death is the ultimate kindness. She would not usually force this on someone, but if she would sooner grant the dying her mercy than mend them. Beyond this, she is particular about how one is to be treated after death. The idea of people being used as mere things to benefit others does not sit well with her.

>Personality
Despite the morbid nature of her interests, Fun has a friendly and almost cheery demeanor. Even when fighting there's a distinct lack of fury in her movements. That isn't to say she doesn't grow upset as she hates nothing more than those who treat the dead as objects.
Still, cruelty is not inherent to her nature, and even when cutting down a foe she does her best to give them a good death as she sees no reason to make them suffer. Following this logic, should she land a blow that fails to kill she'll become distraught become more driven to end her victim's perceived suffering.
 
While she used to be a bit secluded due to her focus on her mission, she had made and maintained a friendship with others like her. She regularly visits a certain Color's office to converse with them and has grown somewhat close to her as well. She is unquestionably loyal to her sisters as they are some of the few she selfishly wishes to live.

Additionally, her behavior has earned her something of a following, being revered by some as a kind of guardian. The sick come to her to ease them into the afterworld. Some give offerings in return for her protection. She holds ceremonies to help loved ones say goodbye. And when she cries for those who have passed, she does not cry alone. It is essentially a small church that welcomes all as long as they show respect for the fallen and are not put off by those who embrace death. Their activities are mostly harmless, though Funeral herself can be disruptive to the activities of some nearby syndicates.
