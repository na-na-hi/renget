### Wallis ♀ ☆
Wallis struggled to understand pokemon during her time as a human, yet she finds herself stuck in a world with nothing else but pokemon.
“It’s a pain, but I guess I’ll figure something out.”
Her most recent memory lends to her having a knack for rescuing, so she plays to her strengths as she looks for her lost memories.
“Y-You’re just trying to get on my good side, aren’t you?!”
She can be abrasive at times but seems to truly care where it matters. Sometimes even she has trouble reconciling this.
“That’s private and crossing the line! If you know so much about me, why don’t you fill in my lost memories?!”
Like she said, she’ll figure something out.
