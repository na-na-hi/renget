#I feel like I'm dissolving
Sandatsu felt his body tense up. Even with 「Slowmo」 kicking in, he could barely follow Shihai's movements as she approached him. She was expressionless, and her actions lacked any specific feeling other than coldness. With a single strike from his mother, everything went black.

He got up from the ground right after his crushed head finished healing. Shihai was sitting behind her desk again. She was cleaning her blood-stained hand with a hankerchief, so only a few seconds should have passed.

*"As an enforcer, I had to punish your actions regarding the pro-hero Psyking,"* said Shihai. *"While I understand he was a witness and you disposed of him in a way that would benefit the mission, your way of carrying it out left much to be desired."*

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
He had gotten used to this place. The endless, empty building felt more inviting than Shihai's brutalist office. After some time there, he found an interesting location. A huge open room with several chairs of different colors and styles. The room was missing a wall, and in its place was only an endless black void.

Sandatsu was sitting on a simple gray chair.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*"However, your actions have indeed turned the situation around, and you have gotten yourself a capable handler who has proven herself to be very useful. As such, I have decided to allow you to operate."* continued his mother.

*"Don't get too cocky just because you got praised,"* said Sandatsu, looking at a yellow chair.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ReapRIP: It's true that I admire the people I fear.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sandatsu looked at the darkness beyond the room.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ReapRIP: But I feel like there's more to it.

[...]
[...........]

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ReapRIP: There's more to just about everything.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The White Rabbit broke the beam that supported the gates, causing them to collapse just after Miriam had moved out of the way. The area where Big Hat had settled was full of abandoned factories, which she could use to her advantage to escape her pursuer.

While the villain kept on running, her construct stayed behind to slow down their enemy.

Right when the remains of the destroyed gate were blown away, the White Rabbit closed the distance in less than a second with a leap and punched the intruder on the head with her enhanced strength.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sandatsu felt a hand on his head for a second before Bobby landed behind him, celebrating his incredible move with the others.
*"Yooo,"* said Hifumi, *"Absolutely brutal!"*

*"Haha, Sandy got dunked on; I can't believe it!"* laughed Inigo.

He looked at them. Bobby turned around with a smile on his face.

*"It was a nice game, though,"* said the boy, raising his hand for a high five with Sandatsu.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The intruder returned the attack, hitting the White Rabbit with a backhand strike empowered both by his own enhanced strength and powerful psychokinesis, sending the construct through a wall.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Back at that empty building, Sandatsu looked at three chairs. One was a fierce red, another was neon green, and the last was amber.

*"Hanging out with you guys is very fun,"* he said.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ReapRIP: They should be ere soon enough
ReapRIP: I want to eat ramen again.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ReapRIP: I feel like I'm dissolving.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sandatsu looked through the window of the guard tower, just like he had done on the day of the execution. This time, though, all he could see was the training grounds of his school, where her classmates were warming up for PE.

Miriam had changed her plans. There had been too many close calls, and she needed to heal herself after the last time the enemy had caught her. The White Rabbit had only been able to slow the intruder down, so now the strategy had switched to having her construct carry her.

Their pursuer was relentless and was clearing the rubble that the Rabbit left on their way incredibly fast.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ReapRIP: My head goes from feeling muddy to feeling incredibly clear.

ReapRIP: It's oddly relaxing.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The villain had grown desperate. The White Rabbit had brought her to the top of a building that had been abandoned before being finished. More than half of its structure was just metal beams.

*"You have to get out of there; Sandatsu's climbing in!"*

Was that Faith's voice?

Yeah, it had to be. This was Battle training, and she was on the enemy team. He remembered now. Sandatsu was climbing the building to get to Hailey and Faith.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Right when Sandatsu arrived at the top of the building, his head was crushed between the hands of the White Rabbit. Big Hat knew that her opponent would regenerate incredibly fast, so the White Rabbit kept on crushing his head over and over to keep him incapacitated.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*"They are putting up a good fight,"* said Sandatsu.

He looked to his side, as if the yellow chair had talked to him.

*"I don't know if that will work."*

He looked at the red, green, and amber chairs.

*"I thought you guys would suggest something... I guess I don't have any other options."*

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ever since he stole his first quirk, Sandatsu had gotten used to being a brawler. But his current situation required finesse.
When he had regenerated barely enough, the first quirk he used was 「Slowmo」. He needed it to pull off the plan. The second was psychokinesis." He could barely tell Big Hat's position without fully healed eyes, so he blasted the area where he thought she'd be, sending everything flying.

The White Rabbit turned around, ready to try and catch her master. But the steel beam under her feet gave in right before she was able to leap to catch Big Hat. Sandatsu had used separate, causing the building to collapse. Without a foothold, the Rabbit wouldn't be able to jump, no matter how strong she was.

Sandatsu and Big Hat both fell along the building, but the Rabbit didn't. She was being kept in midair by psychokinesis.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sandatsu looked at the yellow chair again.

*"I have to admit, your plan was good, yeah."*

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ReapRIP: What the fuck are you talking about?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How long had he been walking? Why was he even on an unknown mountain? He was so tired. And hungry.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Big Hat was no stranger to damage and pain. She was used to healing herself as much as others. But this time was different. She couldn't move or feel anything, really. She was stuck there on the ground, only able to move her eyes. The fall had caused her catastrophic damage. Where was her construction? If the Rabbit helped her, she could probably restore herself to full health.

The villain saw something. A figure approached her, obscured by the dust caused by the destruction. It was the intruder, limping towards her.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*"You guys want to go for some ramen after hitting the showers?"* was that Hifumi's voice?

*"Good ramen should be saved for victory celebrations, but I am pretty hungry,"* answered Inigo.

*"As long as you don't mind seeing me wrestle the chopsticks before every bite, then sure,"* said Bobby.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ReapRIP: Did this even happen?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*"What about you, Sandatsu?"*

*"Yeah. I-"*

Before he could finish answering, he was back at that unknown mountain.

*"I'd like that,"* finished Sandatsu.

He was incredibly hungry. Walking like a zombie due to exhaustion. But luckily, he spotted something. An injured white dove, unable to fly or move but still alive and breathing. Sandatsu stumbled forward, grabbing the bird. He had to eat and recover some energy so he'd be able to complete his mission.

What was that mission again? Something about bear attacks in those mountains? He could barely remember.
