Quirk refinement x2 (changes his body to respond to the force applied to him)

While Nekiro looks normal and all when he is in his costume, you might laugh at how you would see him in school(he hates when people laugh at his smaller form)  . The normal 180 cm stature shrunk down to a mere 110. The whole of his body looks chunky. His quirk G-Force allows him to change the gravitational force from the earth upon himself, and his body changes to match it. While his quirk would normally only allow him to jump really really high and float down, he uses it to train his body to handle a gravitational force much stronger than what is on earth. This effectively strengthens him immensely. However, he has to live in his shorter forms or else he would eventually return to his more natural strength, though it would take months. He however can (as of his senior year) reach 200 cm when he reduces the gravity, though going too extreme in either direction puts his internal organs in danger. 

Nekiro comes from a working class family. His mother stayed at home and his father is a police officer, though he usually had to pick up overtime to cover for the family of 4(and 5 before Nekiros older sister was old enough to work). Early into elementary school, after figuring out that his quirk could be used to physically strengthen him, Nerkiros family began pushing for him to become a hero, much like a parent pushing their child to become a Doctor. While his Father always helped more with the training, it was Nerkiros mother that pushed for it. In her mind, the family had helped people plenty, with her husband and daughter serving the city police, and they deserved more. As Nekiro got older, his social life suffered from the constant strain of training. A resentment grew between him and his mother, her goal for him, and to an extent women in general. Mommy issues aside, he had hoped getting into UA would at least give him the burning passion to be a hero. But going into the third year now, and he has yet to feel it, it is just a job to him.


Nekiro usually has a different attitude depending on which form he is in. A shorter form would usually result in a more stressed attitude, which he is (unfortunately) usually in. He can come off as stand-offish or rude, especially after an extended period of training or combat. Though, Nekiro really doesnâ€™t mean to come off this way. He may snap at someone but feel bad about it the rest of the day. The clear lack of PR ability has limited the options for internships and work studies over the past few years, yet despite that, the school has always found someone that needs another sidekick. When he is able to relax and be in his normal or taller forms for a while, he loosens up, though only so much.
