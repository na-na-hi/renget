Goyona Shi-Shi Kai by /bara/hmoma/ writefrien

>A busy Asian market, bustling with the usual activity
>It's a Friday so everyone's out after work, looking to pick up dinner or whatever they find
>Suddenly the cacophony of people trying to hawk their wares starts to die down.
>It becomes a tense murmur as people part to let a shadowy group pass through the crowd
>It's the Yakuza
>And much to the terror of everyone there, it was the goyona shi-shi kai
>A.K.A the "Audacious Lions"
>The group was known for being made up almost entirely of younger males, with the eldest and strongest taking the role of boss
>They were also known for remaining turbulent and small, as the leadership was constantly infighting for the crown
>That being said, this left every surviving member an extremely keen killer. Truly earning the title of audacity
>Many larger and more wealthy groups had tried to muscle in on the goyona, seeing their constant infighting as weakness
>In every instance, they were given a black eye as they experienced massive losses, and were forced to pull out. The lions losses were always minimal.
>Supposedly the group had gone quiet recently, rumours spread that the pride was under new management again.
>The original boss, Jiro, was one of the toughest, meanest bastards alive, so whoever took the title from him had to be terrifying.
>Except...
>Jiro was walking with the others, like it was any other day.
>Notably, he had earned quite a few new scars, and was no longer walking at the front.
>He was flanking the new boss, and seemed quite proud of it.
>There were a couple audible gasps as people caught sight of the new leader.
>They expected a lion, naturally...
>But it was a human!?
>Not only that, it was a fairly normal looking one at that, what the hell happened?
>A sake vendor made the fatal mistake of snickering at the sight of a soft human leading a pride of lions
>There was a blur of golden fur, and Jiro was suddenly on him, pinning him to a wall
>"SOMETHIN' FUNNY ASSHOLE?!"
>People scurried away from the scene, the lion was certainly not impressed with the sake vendor's attitude
>The lion kept pressing the man for a response, but it's not like he could say much with his windpipe being crushed
>"Jiro, that's enough"
>The human just gave Jiro an order!
>THE Jiro!
>Looking like a scolded pre-schooler, the lion reluctantly released the man, and returned to the boss' side
>The human then strode forward, and picked the sake vendor off the ground, dusting him off.
>"Apologies for that Mr. Tanaka"
>The human casually produced a cigarette from his breast pocket "Oh, that reminds me, today's collection day!"
>The lions began pulling, pushing and shoving each other, before one finally broke away and made a dash to the boss' side
>"Annnd it looks like you owe us for your weekly 'insurance' fee" The lion produced a lighter, beaming at the appreciative nod the boss gave him
>"Would you happen to have it on hand?" The human's words were casual and formal on the surface, but his eyes...
>They were like an apex predator's
>For some reason Mr. Tanaka, a grizzled tiger in his 40's, easily twice the height and weight of this human, felt an instinctual fear.
>He'd short changed some of the younger punks in the group before, and they didn't dare question him on it. Sometime he felt like he could give even Jiro a run for his money if it came down to it.
>Right now that same bravado was nowhere to be found, the human was just standing there, trying to get his smoke to light, but Tanaka felt like he had a gun to his head.
>Before the human could finish taking a single drag of his smoke, the sake vendor produced a wad of cash, with a generous tip for his earlier infraction
>The human thanked the vendor for his business, and went on his way.
>With that, everyone breathed a sigh of relief.
>As for the lions, their breath felt a little short, and their cheeks a little warm after watching their new boss at work.>The gang continued on their way, most of the shopkeeps were more than willing to give the new boss tribute after that display
>The syndicate had turned record profits on "insurance" today. And the guys seemed to be in a pretty good mood
>Jiro was quite literally drooling at the fat wad of cash you had in your hand.
>"Heyyy boss, I know a nice little spot in town we can visit to celebrate, you've been full on since you took over, watcha think?"
>The ghost of a grimace flashed over the boss' face "What kind of spot? that last strip club we hit up was a little...Seedy"
>The boss remembered the floors being particularly covered in seed.
>"Nothin' like that! I was thinking the opposite! C'mon the boys'll love it!"
>The boss considered it for a bit, Jiro seemed like a totally different guy after the two of them met
>He was still a violent thug, but without the pressure of leadership he seemed to be chilling out a little.
>Less that two months ago you two were basically fighting to the death, a small altercation in a bar had turned into an all out blood feud.
>The most notable memory for the boss was still watching the rain trickling down Jiro's chest and forming a little waterfall between his pecs
>Oof, okay back to the issue at hand
>The Boss had tried to order them to take days off, but their stupid macho lion brains would only interpret that as a sign they looked tired, and by extension, weak.
>Glancing around they did all seem a little worn out, if you relaxed then they'd relax with you
>"Alright, where are we going?"
>Like a group of schoolboys, they all cheered, herding you towards wherever they had planned.
>Jeez...
>Boss ends up (Reluctantly) following the gang to whatever activity they had planned
>Seriously, why were they so insistent that he tagged along, most people weren't this chummy with their boss
>Especially considering this was a criminal outfit...
>Eventually the rowdy gang make their way up to a surprisingly nice part of town
>Up until this point their ideas had ranged from seedy to outright hobotastic
>You finally arrived at the..."Happy Capybara indoor hot spring and spa"
>This did not bode well

>"I'M THE SECOND LEUTENANT I GET TO DO IT"
>"PISS OFF I'M THE ADMIN CHEIF, I OUTRANK YOU"
>Both lions, making an absolute scene over who gets to help boss wash his back
>"Guys I can reach my own b-"
>"EHHH!? ARE YOU NEW TO THE YAKUZA OR SOMETHING YOU STUPID FUCK!? ADMIN'S A SECONDARY BRANCH WE DON'T NEED YOUR PENCIL PUSHING ASS!"
>"I'VE PUT MORE GUYS IN THE GROUND THEN YOU MOTHERF-"
>Just as First lieutenant Jiro is about to gut the two of them for daring to speak over their boss, there's a rush of air next to him and suddenly both of the arguing lions are skipping across the water like pebbles before crashing spectacularly into a wall.
>Stunned, the lions didn't even have time to register what happened.
>In the middle of the hazy, gigantic bath, the boss stood
>He had moved from a relaxed sitting position, through thick splashing water, and taken out two fully grown made-men so fast that the others took a second to register it.
>As the two lions sheepishly picked themselves up, clearly still dazed. the boss spoke.
>"You're bothering the other patrons, and me, with your arguing. Quiet down"
>"Also don't talk over people, it's rude"
>As the human silently took his seat in the now-settling yuzu water. The offending kissed their foreheads to the floor in apology before slinking back into the bath.
>The yakuza in the bath trembled, but not entirely in fear
>That wasn't just terrifying, it was also really cool! Boss was crazy strong!
>The scolded pair were thrown by the wrist, so boss (technically) held their hand!
>Externally, this was a scene of hardened killers trembling in fear before an inhuman boss
>Internally, they were closer to high school girls who had just met their idol
>The lions eventually returned to chatting with a semblance of civility again, and the boss had managed to unwind just a little
>"...H-hey Jiro"
>"What's up boss?"
>"There's a spot on my back I can't reach. Do you mind?"
>The lion quietly thanked god
