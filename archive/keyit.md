Sad, genuine smile. Ch. 2.

Sometimes while walking on the streets, you'd think that someone was about to jump you. Not to beat you, necessarily, but to yell at you and to chew you out. A fair amount of paranoia had set in after your run in with Kanata, you had to make things clear with her. You had to make sure there were no misunderstandings, and most importantly, that she wouldn't tell Towa about it. Everything hanged from this one thread, and this was part of salvaging it. You checked your phone. You had to turn right on the next street.

~*~

"Hey anon" read the text.

A sense of urgency came and you asked Towa to excuse you while you went to the bathroom, she pouted a bit with a delicious smile that could heal a soul. You checked your phone and recognized the person in the profile picture, it was Coco. Your blood ran cold for a few seconds. You began organizing your thoughts one by one before replying.

"How did you get my number?" 

"That doesn't matter. We need to talk face to face."

"It's super important" She followed up.

"I cant right now..."

"I cant today either, so let's set a day"

"Alright. Just to talk"

You turned your phone off and went back to Towa, who was also checking her own phone before swiftly putting it on top of the nightstand and stretching her arms out to you.

"Anon! Come, come!"

You lied in bed next to her and let her hit you with a barrage of short kisses, before prompting herself up and looking at you, red faced.

"A-Anon, how do you feel about..." She fumbled with her own words.

You said nothing, waiting for Towa to finish her sentence, before she suddenly pulled your shirt down by the neck and sucked on your left pectoral, leaving behind a hickey. You too blushed massively at her and she laughed before letting herself fall in your arms.

"There!"

You gave the embarrassed Towa a kiss on her forehead, as she dug herself deep into you, slowly falling asleep. You wrapped your arms around her waist, and caressed her while looking at the ceiling.

~*~

You stood outside the apartment complex Coco had told you to go to and asked the receptionist for directions to find her room. Finally standing before her door, you knocked loudly, but didn't receive an answer. Before you were about to knock again, you heard the door unlock and slowly open. Behind it was a girl in sportsy clothes, her hair was messy and she was wearing slippers. 

"Hey, there you are! Come in, please."

You stepped into Coco's apartment with a feeling of fear, you were sure she was about to split your head open with a single punch, but instead she guided you to her kitchen and asked if you wanted anything to drink.

"Oh, just some water, it's hot outside, you know." You tried to sound as casual as possible, but the feeling of danger still didn't subside. Coco served you a glass of water and she got herself some iced tea. She sat next to you and drank without saying a word.

"Thanks for the, uh, water, Coco."

"Don't mention it!" She said, with an almost plastic cheerfulness.

You both stared at nothing and said nothing for a bit. None knew how to start the conversation, until you broke the ice.

"So, what did you have in mind?"

Coco spun her cup on it's bottom, before letting out a tired sigh and finally turned to face you.

"It's about what happened with Kanata." Her response shook you to your core and you spewed out the first thing to come out of your mind.

"W-What happened with who? I don't kn-" But your lie was cut by Coco's rage.

"Don't fucking play dumb with me! Kanata told me everything." In that moment, you felt your soul exit your body, only to be brought back because you needed to answer to Coco.

"What did she tell you?" You asked almost unconsciously, still trying to process the situation.

"What did she tell you?" Coco mocked you in a childish tone. "You two had sex, duh. She was evasive for a while, so I asked her what's up and..."

Coco sighed. That's right, she was dating Kanata at the time. 

When Coco laid the situation bare like that, it felt almost silly to had had such dread. After all, you were here to talk, right? You knew you had no way out of this one regardless of what she knew. It would come sooner or later. The guilt remained, but you felt you could talk about it.

Coco got up, reached for her fridge and took a beer out, offering you one which you declined.

"Isn't tea and beer a bad combination?" You said trying to talk Coco out of it.

"Don't care."

"Isn't a bit early, too?"

"It's the weekend." Said Coco as she opened her beer and started to drink. She seemed lost in thought for the most part and kept gulping down her drink, mumbling something to herself before she finally spoke up.

"Look, she can't really face you right now, so I'm trying to help you two set things straight." Coco said with a demanding voice. "She didn't know how to handle her feelings and messed up, that's all, oh, but don't think I'm excluding *you* from it." She remarked, pointing at you.

"Yeah, I really don't know what took over me, I'm so-" But Coco interrupted you once more.

"You don't?" Coco began reproaching you. "Kanata knew that you were pent up. " This surprised you. "Whenever your name came around the chatroom, she always listened. Towa talked wonders about you, she sounded so dreamy, but then one time I asked something.... obscene, and... she spilled the beans about your sex life."

"What did you ask?" This question picked your interest.

"That doesn't matter..." Said Coco before laughing to herself. "But it was pretty funny you know, I asked if she wanted a 'tail' for you."

"Oh..." You grumbled.

"What? You expected me to ask about your size?" Coco smiled smugly at your crushed ego, before turning to a serious face once more. "Anyways, I won't tell Towa about it, and as far as I know Kanata herself hasn't told anyone else but me, so you're both in the clear. That's why you two have to make things right. I don't want her beating herself up about it anymore, and I don't want Towa to find out, spiral into depression and tear apart our job because of it."

Coco handed you Kanata's number, and with that your little chat was over. As Coco saw you out, you turned around and asked her.

"Coco, eh, do you know why Kanata...?" Coco seemed baffled at you, and also incredibly mad. 

"Oh well, I don't know, why don't you fucking figure it out yourself?" You exited her apartment and waved goodbye, she closed the door and locked it once more without returning the gesture.

It had gotten late. You walked around the streets with your phone in your hand before a loud bell's ringing became closer and closer. A cyclist had almost crashed into you, which made your heart jump for a second, and then, it finally hit you.

~*~

It had been before Towa was officially dating you, perhaps 5 or 6 months by now.

You had been chasing Towa for a while now, still undefeated, until she finally warmed up to you. Everything was looking great for you, and you were in absolute cloud nine. Towa had invited you out for the night and without second thought, you donned your best clothes and perfume, and made sure you could pay with both your card and cash. Despite being incredibly nervous, you wouldn't pass out on this chance, not after longing for this moment for so much.

You reached the place she told you and waited. For a while nothing of notice happened, someone had passed by in a bicycle ringing it's bell, before almost crashing into a passerby. Said passerby was looking at their phone and they placed their own hand on their heart for a second, before looking around them and standing in a spot close to you. It was Kanata.

You did recognize her, but she didn't know who you were. She seemed to eye you for a bit, but you thought it was just your imagination. An odd coincidence, finding someone like her in a place like this, an odd coincidence that turned into a greater one when an orange haired woman reached for you two and hugged Kanata lovingly. Kyriu Coco? Maybe they were here to meet with each other and you just happened to see it, but then, Coco turned to you and greeted you in an energetic way.

"Ah! you must be Anon!" 

"W-What?" You thought to yourself, but didn't want to be rude, so you returned the greeting regardless. Kanata seemed embarrassed, before turning to you.

"S-Sorry, I didn't realize you were Anon, I didn't know what you looked like." This only made you more confused, as Towa appeared last sprinting across the street.

"Ha... sorry, I got trapped by red lights." She greeted her friends and blushed as she turned to you.

"A-Anon! You made it!" Coco gave her a sly look, which made Towa even more embarrassed.

And so, the four of you went out for the night.

Ramen, a few jokes here and there, you made like a walrus using chopsticks and everyone laughed, a little bit of chit chat, and you left for an arcade. 

"I hope you don't mind me bringing my friends, Anon." Said Towa, as she played a game with you in which you had to knock ducks off a boat.

"I certainly don't." You lied. 

"It's been a long time since I've gone out with a guy, you know, I got really nervous... So I needed some help." Towa blushed. Suddenly you felt like a piece of shit for thinking what you did. 

"Ah, but next time, It'll be just us, promise!" Towa added.

"Next time"? That meant you already had one foot in the door. You could feel yourself dancing to an upbeat swing inside. The game ended and you bought Towa a little plushie.

Kanata had been eyeing you, but you didn't pay much mind because you were high off of Towa saying "Next time". Once you all went home, Towa and Coco went one way, Kanata and you went the opposite one.

You walked Kanata to her station, she remained quiet other than when she saw a cat sleeping in a piece of cardboard. The cat woke up with your footsteps, Kanata tried to approach it and he ran, still in sight. Kanata let out a sad ah as you dropped to your knees and began calling the cat back with your hand moving from side to side on floor. This had picked the cat's interest and it slowly approached you two, before finally letting himself be pet.

Kanata was happy, scratching the cat's chin as you passed hand across his back. Kanata kept turning her eyes to you, without you noticing, being too focused on the fluffy boy before you. Then, she spoke.

"He's really cute." You nodded. "Do you have a cat back home?". With that, a little snowball began falling down a hill, Kanata and you made small talk about daily life and the subject had somehow landed at relationships, more specifically, Towa and you.

You spoke in such a manner about her, Kanata couldn't help but be impressed, but one thing lingered about in the back of her head.

"Why did you aim for an idol?"

"You mean why I chose Towa? Well, I didn't, my heart did."

"But, weren't you discouraged that she wouldn't even look at you?"

That did hit you hard, but after you'd come this far, it meant nothing.

"You can never expect something to come out of doing nothing, and even if you fail, at least you tried." You turned to Kanata before finishing your sentence. "That's more than what most people do."

You turned your face back to the cat, whom was purring loudly under your hand, so, you didn't notice how Kanata's face lit up for a split second.

You saw Kanata to her station and waved her goodbye, then left for your home, still giggling to yourself over Towa.

~*~

"So, that's what Coco meant..." You had sat on a bench and watched the streetlight, hearing it's buzzing. It's a quiet night, but inside you raged a storm.

Both you and Kanata were filthy with sin, and you had to cleanse yourselves.

~*~

The week went by fast, your mind was foggy once more, but you did your best so it didn't show. You still hadn't reached for Kanata, but you did catch her streams alongside Towa's, she seemed normal for the most part, except when she collabed with your girlfriend, then she became more quiet, almost mute.

Coco had been chewing you out, asking often if you'd spoken to her, with your answer being you needed time. Truth was, you were just a coward.

Finally, after so much beating around the bush, you sent her a text message, for which you didn't get a reply until two days later.

"Hey"

"Hey"

Off to a great start, you thought

You left her on seen for a bit, before getting straight to the point.

"We need to talk about it"

Kanata is typing, Kanata is online, Kanata is typing, Last online: Just now, Kanata is typing.

"Yeah"

You agreed on a time you were off work and she didn't stream. Once the day came, you were leaving Towa's house after hanging out before her stream. 

"Anon, wait!" Towa stopped you and placed her phone in front of you two to take a selfie, before she did, she gave you a sudden kiss on the cheek which made you visibly blush. She laughed at how cute you were and set the image as her phone background, seeing how happy that made her, you asked for the pic and did the same to your lock screen.

And so, you left for Kanata's place.

"I'm the fucking worst." You thought to yourself, sulking with a frown.

~*~

Kanata sat across the table looking at her glass, sneaking a little peek at you only to turn her attention back at her half-empty juice. The air was heavy and almost unbreathable.

She had let you in without saying a word and politely offered you something to drink. That little bit of oppression in your chest didn't allow you to enjoy any of it. You could hear Coco's mad voice in your head, and with that little push, you pointed out the elephant in the room.

"So..." You said, gathering your strength. "About what happened that night."

Kanata's eyes jumped for a second.

"Listen, I think we both regret it deeply. I just want to put that behind us, ok? Towa doesn't need to know, no one else needs to know, and everything goes back to normal." Or so you hoped. You could always look away from Kanata and focus on Towa if you were ever together in the same room again, and outside of that, you just had to ignore each other.

The word regret had lingered for a bit in Kanata's head. Her silence was puncturing your guts.

"I'm sorry." She finally said. Good enough of a response, so you apologized as well, thinking this entire ordeal was close to ending, but then, you heard Kanata sobbing, and starting to cry. Your instincts kicked in, and you got up to try and calm her down rubbing her back.

"It's not fair." She said. "She always talked wonders about you on our chats, but you were feeling miserable, weren't you? I didn't want to take a backseat to this..." Kanata's feelings poured out of her mouth and her eyes, in the form of a rant and tears.

"I did do something stupid, but I thought it was my only chance to..." Your heart sunk. Kanata looked for comfort in your arms and you couldn't say no.

~*~

Towa was streaming as usual, she peeked at the chat members trying to scout your name, but didn't see it. Discouraged, she stopped paying attention to her game for a second and died, realizing she was live, she snapped back to reality and passed it off as a dumb moment. Still she sneaked a glance to her chat, trying to see you in there.

"Why is he so late?" She thought.

~*~

Kanata wet your shirt with her tears. She had rambled for a bit about her being a terrible friend and how much she was sorry about bringing you down after that, because she knew you were feeling like absolute shit after that night, it was natural to feel like so. Not only that, but Towa spoke to her about it, and that too, pierced her heart with a bullet, trying to remain as quiet as possible about what happened. Only you, her, and soon after that night, Coco, would know what happened, bringing her own relationship to the ground.

You held her in silence as she calmed down.

"Thanks, Anon." She said, her voice being muzzled out by your chest.

"Heh, don't worry about it." 

Unconsciously, you gave Kanata a kiss on her head, which she took gracefully, before both you realized what you had done. You must've done it out of habit, comforting a sad Towa after something happened, after getting harassed by perverts online. You looked into Kanata's eyes, searching for a glimpse of anger that would justify you getting punched and thrown out, but instead, she leaned in closer, wrapping her arms around your neck, stepping on her toes to get closer to you. You were split into two different people, the one who loved Towa, and the one who longed for Kanata's touch once more, the latter took control of you, and you grabbed Kanata by the waist, pulling her up into a kiss, a kiss that became more intimate as it went on, you grabbed Kanata by her butt and she wrapped her legs around you. The kiss stopped so you two could breathe, with a string of saliva connecting both of your mouths.

~*~

Towa finished streaming and she lied on her bed, letting out a sigh. Another day of work. She was trying to cuddle you in her bed, before realizing you weren't there.

"Oh yeah, Anon isn't here today...." Towa sat on the bed and tapped her feet on the floor with increasing excitement, before grabbing her phone and calling your contact, giggling to herself. No response.

"Oh?" Thought Towa, before calling again and getting the same result. Towa became pouty for a second. "I wanted to hear his voice...Anon must be busy, or maybe he just fell asleep. I'll just text him and wait." 

Towa smiled to herself, and began typing.

~*~

In a completely dark bedroom, Kanata and you were making out in bathed breaths. Loud panting echoed across the room as your fingers rubbed against her underwear and Kanata did the same with her hand on your member. Both of you slid a hand under and began gently touching each other. You bit Kanata's neck and she let out a loud gasp, slowly kissing down to her small, petite bust. You took out your wet finger from Kanata's insides and slid down her underwear, not being able to resist anymore. Kanata did the same, jerking your cock for a bit before letting go and placed herself on top of you. She just waited there for a few seconds, both of you squeaking when you entered her secret garden.

Kanata's insides were tight, wet and creamy, she sounds her womanhood made were like music to your ears. You arched your back so she could reach your mouth and kiss you while riding you. In between her moans, you thought you heard something else in the room, but ignored it, not wanting to waste a single second of this precious moment. The second time, the sound was louder than your panting. You looked to your side and saw the only light in this bedroom, other than a little sun sneaking through the curtains. It was your phone, Towa was calling you.

A happy scenery crossed your head.

~*~

"Uwah! The cherry blossoms are so pretty!" Towa turned to you with a delightful smile. You yourself couldn't care less about those pink trees, but seeing her pure joy warmed your heart. Towa was your little bit of spring. Every time she smiled, she bloomed into a beautiful flower.

"Yeah, I guess they really are beautiful."

~*~

But that scene was becoming foggy, Towa's voice became drowned out by loud pants and moans coming from Kanata and you.

You let the phone ring as you were dicking Kanata in the missionary position, both of her legs on your shoulders, her hands holding your head, the screen turned off after a few seconds, sending the image of Towa and you back into the darkness.

"N-Not inside, remember." You took note of her request, and just before you finished, you pulled out and shot your load on her body, covering her tummy, breasts, and even reaching her face. Kanata was pleased, she brushed off your cum off her cheek with her finger and licked it clean, before shivering at the taste.

"Eeek, bitter..." You giggled in good sport, and reached for something to clean her.

You had lunch with her without saying much, but none of you seemed troubled by this point.

Once you left, she just waved you goodbye as a friend would and upon reaching home, you took a shower to wash off the sweat. In the mirror you saw Towa's hickey, which made you realize what you had done. Once more, you had cheated on your beloved girlfriend because of a sexual impulse.

Your soul was muddy, but this time it wasn't as bad as the first. You thought of Towa's cute smile and drowned out the guilt you were about to feel.

Then you saw your phone, two missed calls and two text messages, both from Towa.

"Hey honey!!"

"How are u?"

"Honey"? The nickname made your heart flutter and you replied immediately.

Towa was having a snack when she heard her phone and jumped to answer you. She invited you over to her place to watch a movie and stay the night and you agreed gladly.

"Just this time it's fine, right? This was the last time I do this. From now on, only faps and Towa." You told yourself, almost fully believing it. "Never again." 

~*~

Towa gave you a big hug as soon as she opened the door and she lingered a bit on your neck and loudly sniffed you. A cold shiver was sent like lighting down your spine, suddenly remembering you must've stank of sweat and sex.

"Oh~! You're using the perfume I gave you?" Towa asked you excitedly. Seeing your chance to salvage the moment, you said you were, although you didn't know that you were wearing it, you just put on the first cologne you grabbed.

Towa beamed in joy and let you in.

The movie was ok, the real prize was seeing Towa in her black pajamas cuddled next to you, and then, she began kissing your neck sensually, slowly reaching for your underpants. You had no strength left in you, so for once, you had to be the one to get out of this situation.

"Ah, Towa, right now's not a good time...."

"Why?" Asked Towa in a sensual voice, ignoring your complains, thinking they were just foreplay as she kept reaching for your manhood.

"I-I did a strength test at the gym today...."You lied, right through your teeth. "I broke my personal record, and now I can't really feel my legs."

Towa stopped. "Oh." She said. "That's why you look so tired then..."

"Y-Yeah, it was exhausting, but God it was amazing." You told her, only you knowing the full extent of that statement.

Towa cuddled you like a cat under your arm. And turned off the light, resigned but happy that you were finally here. She felt like asking what you thought about her stream, but quickly dropped the idea. You must've been busy, and surely, you wouldn't miss the next one.

"Anon, can you promise me something?"

"What?"

"When you're bigger and stronger, carry me in your arms."

"Hehe, alright, I will."

You kissed Towa and set off for a bit of rest.
