>Bertha, the eighth of his ant friends. Bertha is the largest warrior ant the ANT KING knows. Though rather slow as a mount, she has the advantage of being able to slowly scale walls and ceilings, those not holding onto her may fall off during this. Bertha is rather shy so you better not make any fat jokes at her expense

>Issue 8 of Atomic Ant published by Wondrous Comics a long time ago. It depicts the iconic scene: Atomic Ant's shrinking device is broken and none of his teammates are around to save him from the rubble yet he manages lift it all. Just reading it is enough to fill you with the determination to move on. That, and a few mementos from his parents.

>Missions
none. lol
>ANT KING is too weak to take on any missions, but he does have his own. To be a king is to have a kingdom. And though he may have the man power to do so, he lacks resources. Any companions or items can work for his cause but what he's really after is the rumored Eden Kit. A pre-war device that's said to bring life to even the most irradiated wasteland. With such a device the ANT KING will be able to improve crop production by 9.4%!
