A first-hand account of how a fan had the time of his life with a charming celebrity



I always idolized Dixie, the young celebrity she-primate, from the time of my childhood.
At night, in my car-shaped bed, I dreamed of meeting her. I always told my friends that
she was my hero, and they thought that was weird for a boy, but still cool. What they
didn’t know was that I had a little secret. I, a human, had deep feelings for a female
chimp in an adorable pink hat.

And get this! This is unbelievable, but true: as adults, me and my childhood hero got to
meet, hang out alone for hours, and...do other stuff!

I had won a prize drawing. It was an E3 charity donation raffle to be exact. It enabled
me to meet one cast member from the Rare games family. Of course, I chose the lovely
chimpess without hesitation. I couldn’t believe it!

It was surreal. The magical moment of our meeting happened during my tour
of the Rare offices. She came through a door, sipping on a banana milkshake (of
course!) and she looked stunning. Short but radiant, her knee pads and Rareware hat
were just as bright pink as ever. Her golden ponytail gleamed in the fluorescent lighting.
We smiled at each other warmly as she said, in the cutest voice ever, “So nice to meet
you!” We got along quite well actually, and had agreed to hang out. I asked her
where she wanted to go, and she said "Oh, your hotel room would be fine. Is that
all right?" I tried to turn my head to hide my blush. "Okay," I said happily.

Could my day get any better!?

The first thing we did after we got situated in my room was talk about how the studio
had written and developed her first game (Donkey Kong Country 2), and how she had
gotten the role. It was fascinating to me. But she admitted to me that this topic kind of
bored her nowadays, and that all she wanted to do...was kiss.

It was true. She had picked up on my attraction to her. I was embarrassed at first, but
she told me that she had known how I felt from the moment I had looked at her in that
office. And, lo and behold, it turned out to be mutual. She actually thought I was
handsome!

Apparently, she had only told a few people how she felt about human males over
the years because of how taboo it was. But she really liked to fantasize about it.
It was kind of...her thing. And Diddy, her ex boyfriend, didn't know either. As long as I
kept her secret though, she said, we could do what we wanted. I agreed, and we proceeded.

It was a little difficult at first because she was just a little over half my height. Then, we
found our groove. She sat on my lap, and I could feel the weight of her cute little body
pressing against my crotch as our lips locked. I could smell her wild scents as she
faintly sweated under her light brown fur. It was driving me crazy! Her long ponytail
swished against the back of my hands as I caressed her soft back. I took it slow though.
It was damn difficult. Here I was holding onto the soft body of someone I’d wanted to
hold for decades!

As we parted for a moment, I asked her, sort of nervously, if I could do something...a
little strange. She told me that it depended on what it was, of course. I told her what I
wanted. To my surprise, she giggled a little.

“Diddy used to do that all the time.”

I sniffed those she-chimp toes that night. Yes, I have strange fetishes (I mean, I was
making out with a celebrity chimp girl!), but her feet were lovely. She took good care of
them; they were well-washed and pedicured. They had just the right mixture of salt and
clean scent. She let me lick between the toes and kiss her soles, all the while my boner
pulsing. She noticed and found it cute and amusing. Our real signature trick was when
she let me suck one foot while she rubbed the other against my cock. I still remember
the squishing noises as she fingered her own small cunt while we did this.

I came on her cute pale belly. She looked at me with those teasing bedroom eyes and
told me I had a lot more jizz than Diddy. Some monkeys just can’t hold the nut like we
humans can. Afterward, she told me it was HER turn to finish.

And don’t you know it? I fucked that little chimp that evening—once in her soft chimp
lady hole (which was so tight that it drove us both to explosive sensations) and once up
her arse. If I hadn’t been panting so hard as I gave her the business, I probably would
have laughed at the primal shrieks she was making as that chimp came in that hotel
room, full of eager human dick. We made a real splash. She hadn’t been this wet since
Lockjaw’s Locker, and I had never been so happy to be covered in sweaty chimp fur,
lying naked in bed next to a satisfied she-primate who was full of my love fluids. It had
felt amazing. She was amazing. She still is.

That’s how my evening went. We had carried on like a couple of old fuck buddies.
Afterward, we were both tired, but we had dinner, and then, finally, we waved a heartfelt
goodbye and parted.

I have no regrets, and I can tell you that that was the best night I’ve ever had in my life.

The little Rareware sweetheart still emails me sometimes (she has to use her friend
Mankey’s computer, and the reception isn’t great out there unfortunately), but so far, no
one has found out what we did. Probably for the best. It’ll be our hot little secret.

Dear diary, I hope your lips are sealed. Signing off now. Good night.
