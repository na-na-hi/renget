Broken Pieces 1

Forgiveness is one of the many challenges humans struggle with. It’s hard to tell whether you’ll be forgiven or not, in Sunny’s case; it’s absolutely unknown. 

As Sunny told the truth, his friends left one by one. Hero was the first to storm off, Kel followed; worried about his brother. Aubrey couldn’t even look Sunny in the eye. She walks quickly out the door, she stops for a moment, then continues leaving.

Sunny sighed and looked at Basil who looked heart-broken, but happy.

“They deserved to know…you did the right thing, Sunny. Now…lets work for their forgiveness.”

Sunny nodded, he couldn’t just let their friendship end here. What would Mari think if he just let their friendship ended on such a bad note? Sunny knew he had work to do, luckily it’s only a 30 minute drive here. 

Sunny isnt just doing this for himself, but for his friends.

2 weeks later

Sunny was visiting Faraway Town, he was with Basil and Kel in the park, playing basketball. Sunny and Basil weren’t very athletic so they took breaks very often. Basil went home early since Polly set a curfew due to the whole incident with Sunny. Sunny and Kel sat at a bench together as the sun was setting. 

“Time flies when you’re having fun, right Sunny?”

Sunny nodded while Kel tossed him a water bottle. They both drank simultaneously likes comedy skit.

“How’s everything at the big city? Hopefully you’re not too bored?”

“Well…it’s pretty loud with all the cars and stuff, but they’ll never be as loud as you, Kel.”

“Hey! Haha. Did the city turn you into a comedian now?”

“I guess it’s just comfortable…talking to you.”

Kel gives off a gentle smile, Sunny looks like he’s genuinely recovering or at the very least, attempting to.

“H-Have you talked to Aubrey or…Hero?” Kel said with hesitation.

“No…I think Hero needs some space. Aubrey on the other hand…I…” Sunny looked down, he felt like he betrayed her (“That’s because you did”). 

“Don’t lose faith, Sunny.”

“Huh?” Sunny looked up to Kel with a confused stare.

“You just have to keep trying, I know they’ll come around eventually. They’re our closest friends…even family, we were able to fix everything before you moved again. I’m sure you’ll do it again.”

“Wow…I…thanks, Kel.”

“Besides, you have the hots for Aubrey right? You shouldn’t keep her waiting dude.”

“H-How did you know!?” Sunny said with his face getting all flustered and red.

“Come on Sunny, it was so obvious. You think I’m dumb or something?”

“U-Ummm…”

“Hey!”

They both started laughing, it felt good having a talk like this. When they both calmed down from laughing, Kel sighed and finally said what was on his mind.

“Sunny, I just wanted to say thank you for telling us about…you know. It’s still hard to take in but…I know you’re not a bad person. Those 3 days together before you moved, the kindness you showed to everyone…no heartless murderer would do those sort of things.”

Sunny just looked at Kel the entire time, hardly blinking and just fixated on his words.

“After everything that happened…you still came back to visit. That shows character, I think? Haha…I…never was one for serious conversations. Just know that as long as you keep trying to amend your mistakes, I’ll be there to help guide you.”

Sunny felt a tear slide down his cheek, then he hugged Kel straight after.

“T-Thank you, Kel…”

“Haha…that’s what best friends are for!”

Kel, even if people might not see it, he matured for his age. The way he was able to just move on from the pain, he wasn’t afraid of confronting the past either. If it wasn’t for him knocking on Sunny’s door, who knows what could’ve happened (“You’d be safe from all this pain”).

As a send off before Sunny left Faraway Town on the bus, they both drank orange Joe together. Kel finished his drink in one gulp while Sunny couldn’t even get a proper sip due to all the caffeine.

Kel.

So loud yet so cheerful. Sunny is lucky to have met him. He knows things will never be how it used to, their old friendship were shattered into pieces. However, that doesn’t mean he can’t create something new with those broken pieces. He has to try at the very least, for them.
