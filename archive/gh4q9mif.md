##Togetic

Personality: Timid
Extremely shy and tends to keep to himself. Can get easily flustered if pulled into a conversation or is in a crowded area with a lot of noise. However will always lend a helping hand when asked, unless the request is joining an adventuring team, in which case he needs some convincing to join. Can be seen as cold by other guild members due to how he avoids interacting with people, but he does care about keeping his fellow guild members safe and healthy. Worried about being on adventuring teams due to his incompetence, low self-esteem, and clumsiness in fights, and also because of his bad luck with using metronome.

Backstory:
Togetic was an autistic loner in the human world before spawning into the PMD world as a Togepi along with a friend from the human world who became a Dewott. The two became a team of outlaws, and Toge evolved during one adventure where he and Dewott saved each other's lives. However, the two ended up having a falling out after Toge revealed he wanted to stay in the PMD world instead of going back to the human world with Dewott, so the two split up. After getting knocked out in a dungeon, Toge was rescued by two Clover Guild members and he decided to join the guild, sharing little about his past. He has shared his real name with only a few guildmembers, and prefers going by Togetic or Toge.

Guild Job: "Secret" Quartermaster
When first joining the guild, Togetic did not attempt to join any exploration teams out of fear of being useless deadweight, and instead decided to focus his efforts on helping the guild in other ways, initially deciding to secretly help keep the guild's item and food stores well-stocked. Eventually, this turned into Togetic secretly re-stocking and re-organizing the bags of guild members while they weren't looking or when they were asleep, as well as doing other small things like repairing/upkeeping guild member's equipment, such as cookware or clothes.

Speech:
Togetic will very rarely ever initiate a conversation with anyone, and when he does it will usually be with constant stuttering, mumbling, and repeating words by accident. If possible, Togetic will always attempt to respond to conversations/questions non-verbally, such as nodding or shaking his head.
The only exception to this is when someone brings up a very niche topic that Togetic is interested in, in which case he will sometimes go on a very fierce, detailed, and autistic rants about said topic and not allow any other Pokemon to interrupt him. Usually, these end with the other Pokemon sneaking away from the conversation without him noticing, and then Togetic feeling very embarrassed. Said niche topics are usually things related to human imageboard "culture" (shitposting)

Joy Dust:
Like all Togetics, Toge produces Joy Dust, a substance that makes anyone who inhales or ingests it feel more joyful. It can rub off on anyone who touches Toge, and if Toge feels someone needs an extra burst of joy, he might splash some joy dust onto them.

##Dewott

Personality: Adamant
Dewott is Togetic's old partner from when they were both outlaws. He has a deep hatred of Pokemon, and his one goal is to return to the human world with Togetic. He genuinely cares about Togetic, but does not care about the lives of anyone who would stand in the way of his goal. In battle he's agile, powerful, cocky, and refuses to use Pokemon moves or his scalchops until he feels like he absolutely needs to, preferring to use human-styled martial art attacks to deal with his foes. He also loves to trash-talk and taunt his foes, especially if he has the upper hand.

Togetic's preparedness also rubbed off on him, and he almost always carries a bag with him full of useful supplies, and despite his crass way of speaking, he's clever enough to set up plans to ambush his targets. While his main goal is "rescuing" Togetic, he might attempt attacks on random Clover Guild members, as he's grown to have a grudge against the guild itself since he feels like they're keeping Togetic away from him.
