[EOH Name]
Laura Nofelind

[One line description]
A loli cat burglar and maker of bad decisions.

[Personality]
While mostly easygoing, Laura can be bullheaded and mischievous at times. Although her antics and sense of humor can be abrasive to some, for those who find Laura cute, or at least tolerable, she can become a loyal friend for life. This is not always simple, as Laura is typically shy and withdrawn, but the shortcuts to a neko's heart are located behind the ears and under the chin. Somewhat arachnophobic and severely thalassophobic.

[Backstory]
Laura was born as the neko Laurent Nofelind on the island of Concurso, and was orphaned at a young age in a tragic boating accident involving a slaver and an angry sea monster. From then he was raised in an orphanage, learning the skills of thievery early and practicing them often. After his physical growth stagnated Laurent became the target of bullying, spending less and less time amongst his peers, until a violent confrontation involving his newly developed claws and a larger orphan's eye prompted him to leave his then-home and never come back.

Laurent struck out on his own to make a name for himself as a professional thief on the fringes of civilization, stealing from those with means in Greyweul and retreating to his hideaways in the Great Wilds. In time he came into contact with other EOH's, most importantly the alraune hive-mind Eden, who took on a parental role to the neko. It was Eden that would eventually facilitate Laurent's transformation into Laura at the cat's own request, with the intention of becoming one of Eden's lovers, and beginning a new chapter in her life.

[Goals]
While not a goal-oriented person, Laura claims that she will become the Greatest Thief in Harahel. Her heart is fickle, true to her half-cat nature, so she is easily distracted by whatever interesting things are happening nearby.
