http://file.vrg.party/w/vrgcraft_1-20-1.zip - instance for importing into your launcher
**link updated on 11/4**

**How to install**
	-Download the instance from the above link
	-Import the instance into your launcher of choice (If it doesn't work, try using pollymc or polymc - a couple of people so far have had issues with other launchers but poly and polly seem to work) [edit: try ATlauncher too, one anon who couldn't get poly or polly to work used that one]

To import an instance into pollymc, click on "add instance" and select "import from .zip." Then select the .zip file you downloaded.

**How to update** (If you already have the instance installed but the mods were updated as indicated by the "link updated on etc")
	-Download the new instance
	-Delete the mods folder from your already installed instance
	-Put in the new mods folder from the new download, and discard the rest of the downloaded files
	-Do NOT *overwrite* the mods folder - you need to completely delete the old one and replace it with the new one after

**How to add offline account in pollymc** (If you aren't using an official microsoft account)
	-Go to manage accounts, up in the top right corner
	-Click on the sidebar button that says "add offline account"
	-Type in your name and it should just work

**How to use the voice chat:**
	By default it is proximity based. If you join a group channel, then you can hear the other group members from anywhere.
		-Open up the radial menu
		-Select voice chat options
		-Turn activation mode to voice
		-From the radial menu you can create or join channels from the voice chat groups menu
	If the voice options are not in the radial menu by default for some reason, you have to open the vr options - radial menu, and select the voice chat
	buttons and assign them. (They are near the bottom of the list.)

**How to use chunk claiming system:**
	Please claim your builds if you think of it. There is a way to do group claims but I have not figured it out yet.
		-Open up radial menu
		-Open chunk claiming map
		-Whatever you have bound to left click is claim, right click is unclaim

**How to use the Little Maids mod** (thanks anon for the explanation)
To spawn a maid you need to make an egg: 2x cakes, 4x sugar, 2x gold bars, 1x egg.
Once the maid is spawned give it a cake to "contract" it and now it's offically yours.
If you hate the ghast noises go to mods > littlemaid rebirth > config button > "silent default voice" to yes at the bottom of the spawn section.

Right click to open its inventory and put a bunch of sugar in. They'll periodically consume it and they also use it for healing. If they have no sugar they won't do anything. If you right click on them while holding sugar in your hand, they'll enter wait mode where they just stand on the spot. right click again and they'll go back to following you

There's a box on the maid's UI with the label "main" on it. Depending on the item you put in it, the maid will perform different tasks. By default they're just in "escorter" mode, they'll follow you and pick stuff up.

-Sword/axe - fencer, attacks mobs
-Bow - Archer, shoots arrows. Needs arrows in its inventory
-Shears - Ripper, shears sheep
-Torches - Torcher, she'll place down torches in dark areas
-Bowl - Cook, give her coal and if there's a furnace nearby she'll cook any food or ores given. Needs to be set to freedom mode first.
-Food items - Healer, she'll fill up your hunger meter

Buttons to the left of the UI:
-Book icon - Select what mobs the maid sees as friendly, neutral, or hostile
-Music box - Change the sounds she makes. Only ghast or none right now.
-Leather chestpiece - Change appearance
-Feather - Change their movement mode. "Escort" follows you. "Freedom" lets them move around freely in a small area. "Tracer" mode will have them follow a path of redstone torches, if you have any placed down
-Sword/axe icon - Determines if the maid should attack only hostile or both neutral/hostile mobs (sword=hostile, axe=hostile and neutrals)
-Sugar icon - Shows their sugar level

Saddle use - Right click on a maid while holding a saddle and they'll sit on your shoulders. Right click again to get them off.

**How to turn radio volume down**
The radios via the voice chat mod are really loud by default, to turn the volume of them down, go to the voice chat settings (radial menu in vr mode, or the V button in desktop mode) and go to adjust volumes, and there should be a volume control slider for radios, in the list with the individual player voice volume sliders.
