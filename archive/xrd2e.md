http://file.vrg.party/w/vrgcraft_1-20-1.zip - instance for importing into your launcher
**link updated on 11/4**

**How to install**
	-Download the instance from the above link
	-Import the instance into your launcher of choice (If it doesn't work, try using pollymc or polymc - a couple of people so far have had issues with other launchers but poly and polly seem to work)

**How to update**
	-If you have already installed it and it is working, but the download link was updated, download the new instance
	-delete the mods folder from your already installed instance
	-put in the new mods folder from the new download, and discard the rest of the downloaded files
	-do NOT *overwrite* the mods folder - you need to completely delete the old one and replace it with the new one after

**How to use the voice chat:**
	By default it is proximity based. If you join a group channel, then you can hear the other group members from anywhere.
		-Open up the radial menu
		-Select voice chat options
		-Turn activation mode to voice
		-From the radial menu you can create or join channels from the voice chat groups menu
	If the voice options are not in the radial menu by default for some reason, you have to open the vr options - radial menu, and select the voice chat
	buttons and assign them. (They are near the bottom of the list.)

**How to use chunk claiming system:**
	Please claim your builds if you think of it. There is a way to do group claims but I have not figured it out yet.
		-Open up radial menu
		-Open chunk claiming map
		-Whatever you have bound to left click is claim, right click is unclaim
