/rcg/ - Really Cool General

Prev: >>

This is not raid cat general. You've been had, bamboozled, tricked and ultimately misled. This thread is for appreciating Alolan Meowth and not for trading or wifi battling. Head to /wfg/ for that.

Feel free to organize and share raids in this threads. Also share any infographics related to the most efficient way to take down specific raids.

Sharing is caring. Zoom Lens, not Wide Lens. EV training takes 10 minutes to do.
