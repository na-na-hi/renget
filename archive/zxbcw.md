#Just Get Therapy Bro

"Now, tell me about your mother."

*KILL HIM. RIP HIS EYES OUT, BASH HIS FACE IN, CUT HIS TONGUE OUT!*

"Is my mother really relevant right now? I have a voice in my head telling me to kill you, I don't think she really ranks."

"Humor me."

"There's nothing humorous about this, I seriously have someone telling me to murder you in my head and I don't know why."

The man across from Alexi simply raised an eyebrow over his horn rimmed spectacles, while the voice in his head raged onward, 

*FOOL, NOW HE KNOWS, HE MUST DIE!* 

Frankly, it's a little annoying.


"Shut up, sorry, not you, please, just listen to me." Behind his mahogany desk, the older man looked rather constipated, his hands crossed tightly over his knee, resting above his other leg in a tightly wound, slightly wiggling posture.

*WEAK! YOU COULD END HIM IN A SINGLE STROKE!* 

With a sigh, Alexi continues on, his eyes glossing over the plate on the desk that read something like, Trauma Counselor Dr. Carroll. He's pretty sure it also said that on the website, but he was also pretty fucked up at the time. He still is, come to think of it.

"It all started like a month ago, right after my sister died, some weirdos tried to jump me, they were dressed like clowns? Or something? I don't remember to be honest with you, and then it was like, I kind of beat the shit out of them. After my head hit the ground the first time, I was just, demon mode or something. They couldn't touch me, and then I was, like, cutting them to pieces, and they were dead. Then I went home. Then like a week later, I start hearing some weird voice before I went bed. Then throughout the day, like an echo, saying absurd things like 'kill worms'. So I start trying to block it out. I haven't been sober for 3 weeks, and it's only getting louder. I'm losing my mind, doc. What is happening to me?"

The man in the burgundy suit looks profoundly uncomfortable. Sweat drips down into thick dark eyebrows, his mop of hair slightly off center, a toupee, and his glasses slip a bit down his nose as he wiggles like a man trying not to piss himself.

"I, uh, um, I'm afraid I'll have to refer you-"	

"No, please-you're my third referral already!"

"It's beyond my scope! Don't kill me!" 

"I'm not going to kill you, I just need, I don't know, lithium, laudanum, xanax, what the fuck ever to make it stop. It's so annoying, I can't get anything done!"

*YOU WISH FOR ME TO CEASE? GET OFF YOUR ASS AND FIGHT YOU MISERABLE FLESH PIG*

"Shut the fuck up! I'm trying to talk!"

Dr. Carrol looks absolutely terrified, hands shaking as they clutch his toupee to his chest, it having fell off at some point during all of his uncomfortable shifting. It's all fucked, so Alexi just gets up off of the purple couch he'd been lying on, picking up his backpack on his way to the door.

"Whatever. Forget I said anything, ok? Or I might actually have to kill you."

"OK! Never happened! Yep! Good luck out there! Mental health is a journey!" The yelps fade as the door closes behind the almost not teenager as he steps out of the room into the hallway of a drab office building.

*FIND A SHARD CARRIER. TAKE ITS HEAD. THEN, PEACE.*

'That is an absolutely absurd demand. I'm not going to go out and kill people because you're annoying.' Alexi responds in his own head, avoiding verbal communication as he finds his way street side, the walls of the stairs covered in dirt and low effort graffiti. **FUCK THE POLICE** **FOR A GOOD TIME CALL-** **NIGG-** How original.

*YOU ARE ABSURD, BOY. YOU TOIL OVER NOTHING, I OFFER YOU PURPOSE.*

'Poetry is a dying art, but I'll keep it on life support alone if I have to.' The streets of downtown Brockton weren't much cleaner, but they teem with life as various people crossed through bumper to bumper traffic with excited yelling.

"YOOOOOOO, TRIUMPH'S FIGHTING THE TEETH, LET'S GOOOOO!"
"TRIUMPH!! STEP ON ME!!!"
"FUCK EM UP!!!"
"I'M GAY!!"
"NIGGA WHAT??!"
"OH SHIT SHE JUST SUPLEXED THAT DUDE!"
"DAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYUUMMMM"

*A FIGHT! YOU MUST GO! KILL! MURDER! MAIM!*

Alexi sighs. He fishes inside his jacket pocket, finding his lighter and his last funny cigarette.

'No I don't think I will.' He exhales, coughing a little, as the haze settles back over his vision, turning the various annoyances into amusements as he walks in the opposite direction from the commotion.

'I don't even have a costume, if I go out there, you get maybe one fight before we're caught or killed. Think ahead.'

*I AM THINKING IN YOUR HEAD THAT YOU ARE A COWARD AND YOU NEED TO FIGHT NOW!*

For once, the voice is right. That odd feeling strikes his spine like a phantom muscle spasm, from around the corner, someone waited to ambush him as he passes by the alley on his way back to the dorms. He knows it, he doesn't know how, or why, but it's proven true as he crosses the gap and has to take a small step back, as an actual club falls down onto where he had been standing, breaking the concrete sidewalk like cheap plastic. He exhales more smoke, coughing again as he laughs at the large, pig looking dude's confused expression.

The snout, floppy ears, thick jowls, and nonplussed gaze, mouth slightly agape revealing filthy teeth, and that isn't even taking into account its honest to god warpaint and various repurposed football gear completely littered with glued on feathers. Like a fucking discount Disney style caricature of Indians, legitimately dollar store DIY Halloween costume tier. He loses it, doubling over as the club sweeps where he his head was sitting just moments ago, laughing so hard he could feel the tears in his eyes. The club smashes into brick, cleaving chunks of red composite across the filthy alley behind the large, poorly dressed parahuman. It roars, taking his ridicule poorly he supposes, charging forward with its massive bulk, abandoning the club entirely. He couldn't tell you why, but he feels the sword in his hand like it had never left, since that one night.

Maybe it never had, the translucent black long-sword looks just like he knew it should, gothic in its design, singularly elegant, slim, and with only a slight flourish of flowering design on the cross guard. With both hands, he slices through the immense bulk of his would be ambusher. Flesh and cheap plastic part like butter, spraying him with blood and viscera as the force of its charge separates into two distinct entities, the torso falling backward as the abdomen tilts forward. Guts and bones brush Alexi's feet as he laughs, the look on the pig man's face still slaying him. The joint lay on the ground where he dropped it, now doused by the blood and viscera. What a waste. With a final chuckle, Alexi continues on, wondering how he'd find the money to scrounge up for a replacement, the voice in his head, for the first time in weeks, satisfied.
