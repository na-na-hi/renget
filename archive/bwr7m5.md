Rosethorn sighed as she walked up the steps of the Shimogyo Prefectural Library. Her hair was messy and her socks were mismatched. After the excitement of the last months, she had settled on having a lazy and uneventful birthday. That was before she received a call from one of her students.

"Rosethorn-sensei! Over here!" Inigo waved eagerly to catch her attention as she entered. He wore an all white-suit with a single rose on his suit pocket. His little dragon, Gigan, fluttered by his shoulder, also waving at her. Rosethorn smiled but seemed confused as she approached. "Good morning, Myoga. You've certainly dressed up.. Now what did you need help with?"

"Help? Oh! Yes!" Inigo fumbled for an excuse. "I was hoping you could advise me on some academic issues I've been having lately. Like picking a college and my future and stuff."

"Academic issues? Well, I'll certainly do my best to offer some advice. You sounded very distressed over the phone"

"Ah yeah that. I've calmed down since you agreed to meet me. Say, sensei, why don't we head out so we can chat more comfortably? Library's kinda full." 

Inigo led Rosethorn towards the exit. Outside waiting for them is a horse-drawn carriage, complete with roses and ribbons, a purple-eyed dark haired teen sat as the cart driver. Inigo grinned expectantly.

"What's all this?" Rosethorn looked confused yet intrigued.

"Your carriage awaits, milady!" Inigo gave an exaggerated bow. "I arranged a special ride to mark this joyous occasion!"

"Occasion?" Rosethorn tilted her head curiously, she paused to look at the eager Inigo before climing aboard. Inigo hopped in beside her.

"Why yes! It's just that great a day!" He presented her with a heart-shaped box tied with a red ribbon. Rosethorn accepted it with hesitation.

"How did you...? Myoga, did you know it was my birthday today?"

Inigo laughed airily, oozing overconfidence. "Yes! And what's a better day than to spend time with your favorite student. Only the best for you, sensei! Speaking of which, I know just the spot for a perfect date!"

Rosethorn nearly choked. "Date? Now see here, young man. I think you may have gotten the wrong impressionâ€” I'm quite busy."

"To Thanks a Latte!" Inigo declared, ignoring her protests. The carriage jolted into motion down the street. Rosethorn sighed, amusement crossing her face. She shrugged and opened the chocolate box, popping one into her mouth. Might as well enjoy the ride. It was a nice day after all. How long has it been since she was last in a carriage ride? High school probably. She sighed.

Inigo grinned roguishly across from her. "So I've noticed you've been feeling down lately. Tell me, my lady, what vexes your tender heart so? Which scoundrel dares cause you distress?" Gigan turned into sparkles around Inigo.

Despite herself, Rosethorn had to laugh. "Really, Myoga.. I have to admit, I'm a bit puzzled. I thought you were seeing someone," she said, a curious expression on her face.

Inigo chuckled nervously, scratching the back of his head. "Ah, that. Well, you see, that was just a rumor. I've been maturing a lot lately. I even grew seven inches over the summer." He winked. "High school girls are one thing but I think I'm ready for a real woman in my life." 

Rosethorn shook her head. "Inigo, I appreciate the sentiment, but I'm your teacher. There are boundaries that we must maintain."

As she tried to clarify the situation, Inigo brushed off her words breezily, focusing instead on charming her with overblown flattery and grand romantic gestures. Rosethorn nearly gave up correcting him multiple times. While confused and a little concerned by his boldness, she found his antics typical and even slightly charming.

As the carriage rolled down the streets, Inigo suddenly stood up. "Allow me to serenade you, my sensei!"

Before Rosethorn could react, he had turned his construct into an accoustic guitar. Strumming a dramatic chord, Inigo launched into a passionate jazz love ballad, crooning the lyrics in an exaggerated vibrato. 

"OH ROSETHORN!~"
"BLOSSOM OF MY HEART!~"

Pedestrians on the street turned to watch the blonde teenager singing. His passion was misplaced, but Rosethorn appreciated the student's creativity as they rode along. She settled in for the ride, content with letting him tire himself out. She might as well see Helene at the cafe if she's in the area.

The fanciful ride ended at Thanks a Latte. Inigo hopped out first, offering a hand to help Rosethorn step down. As he led her towards the cafe entrance, Rosethorn gathered her resolve.

"So what's your answer?"

"Inigo, while I've had a delightful time, I simply cannot allow you to continue pursuing me this way." She spoke gently but firmly. "You're a good student, but this cannot happen between-." Inigo merely winked conspiratorially and threw open the cafe door with a flourish.

##"SURPRISE!! HAPPY BIRTHDAY, ROSETHORN-SENSEI!!"

Rosethorn gasped. The entire cafe interior was decorated festively with balloons and streamers. The students of 1-D cheered excitedly, wearing colorful conical party hats. Even the Principal and other staff members were here. A large cake shone on the center table decorated with candy roses.

"You all...this is..." Rosethorn put a hand to her chest, deeply moved.

Inigo grinned smugly. "Told you this was a special day! For the best teacher any class could have."

Before Rosethorn could respond, Hoge materialized beside Inigo, grabbing his arm possessively. "That's enough play acting, casanova." She pulled him away, shooting Rosethorn a warning glance. 

"I swear I was thinking of you the entire time!"
"B-baka."

Rosethorn couldn't help but laugh as she entered the Thanks A Latte Cafe. What an odd birthday surprise! She'll have to properly thank her endearing, if misguided, students later.
