#Koyori Collar
>Anon paced himself nerviously, in front of the door, as he waited for your package. Where was it? The courier said 3:00 pm and it already was 3:05!
>Finally it arrived at 3:07, as he was drinking his second glass of wine for the nerves, the courier even had the gall to call him a wierdo
>But he didnt care, he had the box with what might possibly be the single most important purchase in his life: A collar for Koyori
>It had been a year since the two of them started dating (After some ''playing doctor'') and he felt comfortable to tie the knot
>Of course, if Anon could even make the question, there was no doubt Koyori was the one wearing pants in the relationship, since he was too much of a wuzz
>So Anon stashed away the box in the last place koyori would look.
>''Damn im smart'' he told himself, as he left for work

>Four hours later, a bored Koyori yaws in the sofa of the house. She's on break and since Anon left to fix some numbers at the office, her mind needs some stimulation
>So, in a rare turn of events, Koyori decides to watch TV, instead of watching some anime in her phone or play some games
>She stands up and  kneels in front of the tv, opening the small drawer where the remote is supposed to be.
>And there, she finds a suspicious box
>A box? hidden from her by anon? with a knot? She squeals in delight as she opens the box in record time, an exquisite collar resting next to a brand new tag
>She feels her heart flutter as she hugs the box, before feeling her body temperature go a few degrees up
>Koyori gulps, hands trembling as she unlocks her phone. Right there, in her calendary, there's a big red square in the middle
>Oh poor anon, whatever plan he had for the reveal, is now done.
>Koyori makes a mad dash to their shared bedroom, in order to get the scene set


>As Anon opens the door, he comes across a strong scent. A strong scent he can help but love
>The house is dimly lit, the strong scent overpowering his senses as he tries to figure out what's going on
>And then he sees it, the open drawer, the empty box
>''Koyori?'' he asks, surprised at how his own legs carry him to the bedroom, bewitched by the scent
>'And there, in the bedroom, Is his love, Koyori, sitting in Seiza.
>Wearing her collar.
>Her collar and nothing more, her lewd body exposed to the warm air of the stuffy bedroom
>Anon gulps, as Koyori slowly crawls to him, the scent of her dripping honeypot becoming stronger
>Like the world's filthiest and horniest bitch, she nuzzles against his crotch
>''Koyori saw it...and she couldnt help but be a very bad coyote'' She takes a whiff of his genitals, satisfied at the hardness of her lover's rod
>''And Bad bad coyotes...need to be broken into if you want them in your house'' she kisses the tip, and even behind two layers of cloth, she feels the spurt of lubrication
>''Like the wild, wild animals they are''
>Anon's pants go down, and Koyori traces the shape of his member with her fingers, barely containing her own lust
>''And to make things worse...when they are in heat, they like to scream and bite''
>Anon's boxers go down, and before he can even protest, He's already inside of Koyori's Mouth, her tongue working a miracle
>Barely holding on, anon speaks with a dry throat
>''And how do you shut them up?''
>Koyori takes a break, strands of spit connecting her mouth to anon's throbbing manhood
>''By Breeding them''



>Anon took another look at the paper in his hands, trembling a bit as Koyori squealed in delight
>The doctor just handed him the bill, a pat on the back and the rest of the photos as he left them
>Money was tight. He was still paying the collar in installments, since it was a premium brand
>He then had to build an extra bedroom, paint it, fill it with baby stuff and even babyproof the rest of the house
>Then the ceremony, oh boy was he still paying that. He was seeing peanuts of his salary
>''how the hell im supposed to feed five kids?'' was the last thing Anon thought, as he blacked out
