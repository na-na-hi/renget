###Do you have an nVIDIA GPU?
####Yes
[NAI Leak Speedrun](https://rentry.org/nai-speedrun)
!!! note Note
	You likely won't ever use the leaked NovelAI model, but if you plan on merging HLL with other stuff, you'll still want `animefull-final-pruned.ckpt` anyways

!!! warning You'll get different output

##wHat mODel is bEsT?
Everyone will give you a different answer. Look at catbox links that anons post or ask them what model they're using. Generally speaking, /vtai/ is merging some version of hll with another merged model, at the simplest level, or merging multiple. Nobody's trained an entire checkpoint of their own beyond hll anon training hll itself.

Short, non-conclusive answer, merges with:
* AOM2
	* Slightly more realistic gens
* 7th anime
	* Stylized
* Counterfeit
	* "watercolor" lookin

Look through the [cookbook](https://rentry.org/vtairecipes) and look at what images generated by the base models used in merges look like. Except now they can draw chubas.

##wHiCh upScalEr iS bEst?

They're different, one isn't any better than the other. I wouldn't be surprised if half of the images you see on /vtai/ are using `4x-AnimeSharp` or another ESRGAN upscaler, which can be downloaded [here](https://upscale.wiki/wiki/Model_Database). They go in your `stable-diffusion-webui/models/ESRGAN` folder.

[Here](https://vt-idiot.github.io/crispy-octo-pancake/xyz/upscalers-0-point-7/choco/index.html) is an old comparison I made, with sliders, that allows you to compare the results of different upscalers. It's flawed, since all of the images were made with denoising set to 0.7, which is far from ideal - it's moreso a comparison of what SD will do with the different upscaler results.

Most of the ESRGAN upscalers like `4x-AnimeSharp`, `lollypop`, etc. all work best at around ~0.4-0.5 denoising strength. Go below that and you start to see more of the upscaler and less of what hi-res fix is doing. Above 0.5 you see even more of what hi-res fix did and less of what the upscaler did. At 1.0 - you'll have a different image entirely, and at 0 - you'll have (close to) the upscaler's raw output.

If you set denoising strength to 0 and Hi-Res Fix steps to 1, you can get an idea of what the "raw" output from your selected upscaler looks like!

##`VAE`
SET. YOUR. VAE.
-> [![No VAE](https://i.postimg.cc/zvRKhTx3/xyz-grid-0006-173451-best-quality-houshou-marine-red-hair-twintails-heterochromia-red-eyes-yel.png)](https://postimg.cc/zH8yZHZ1) <-
It does more than just "add color" - it's the component that actually "makes the image" you see at the end.
>Why do I still get an image even if I don't set one?
I think every model still has "one" in it, it's just not "complete". Some models have one of the VAEs below "baked in" and will make the same images whether you have your VAE set to `Automatic` or `None` - you will however get a different image if you set a different VAE manually. See below for results with NAI SFW, NAI SFW with the NAI VAE "baked in", NAI SFW with the NAI VAE baked in and all pruned to fp16, and a model merge with no VAE baked in.

!!! note
	Stable Diffusion is a text-to-image model that uses a variational autoencoder (VAE) to encode and decode images to and from a smaller latent space. The VAE helps the model to capture the semantic meaning of the image and render fine details such as eyes and faces. In the final steps of image generation, the VAE decoder takes the latent vector from the diffusion process and reconstructs the image in pixel space. The VAE decoder can be fine-tuned with additional data to improve the quality of the image.
!!! note GrugTL _powered by GPT-4_
	* Latent space like secret code. Latent space where small picture live.
	* Secret code have numbers that mean something.
	* Grug not see small picture. Small picture `[0.12, -0.34, 0.56, -0.78]` look like cloudy letter O.
	* Grug see big picture. VAE make big picture. Decoder change small picture to big picture with pixels. Pixels small squares that make picture for grug.
	* This big picture in pixel space:
	* ```
	[
	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
	[0, 1, 1, 1, 0],
	[0, 1, 0, 1, 0],
	[0, 1, 1, 1, 0],
	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
	]
	```
	* This picture have five by five pixels. Picture look like letter O.

###wHaT VaE iS beSt?
There are no new VAEs, and to my knowledge, **nobody has trained any other than _NovelAI, Stable Diffusion, and Waifu Diffusion_** . The answer does not change, and hasn't changed. Any model that "comes with a VAE" comes with one of these.

From what I can understand, it's a block merge of the NAI VAE and one of the WD 1.4 VAEs, `kl-f8-anime2`. It's actually kinda nice!
This is the only actual **"new"** VAE the author is aware of. There are two versions, and in my opinion, the main one is far better. The alternate is almost too saturated, and introduces some weird artifacts that I can't recall seeing with either the SD 1.5 or WD 1.4 VAEs
####SD 1.5 VAE
They're more saturated. No, I don't know what the difference is between the two. I use the `MSE` one because `lol 840000 > 560000`

##Why do people ask for catbox links?
* 4chan removes the prompt information, along with any other metadata, when you post an image.
	+ catbox does not
>catbox is down
	Grass is green, sky is blue, water is wet
	+ litterbox (temporary, 1 hr - 3 day) does not
	+ pixiv does not
	+ byte.wtf (temporary, up to 1 month) does not
		+ byte.wtf links don't (embed) properly though
	+ postimages (temporary or permanent, up to you) does not, provided you choose not to resize your image
	+ imgur **always removes it**

Having the metadata means you can load the image into the PNG Info tab in webui and view the prompt that was used to generate the image.
###Can I view metadata for catbox uploads while I'm browsing 4chan, or upload directly to catbox while I'm posting?
Yes. Install this [userscript](https://gist.github.com/catboxanon/ca46eb79ce55e3216aecab49d5c7a3fb) for 4chanx.
!!! warning
	If your image was >4MB and webui converted it to a JPG, the userscript won't display the metadata because it can't read EXIF tags out of a JPG, only iTXT chunks from a PNG.
###Why do some filenames look like `catbox_1a2b3.png`?
They were uploaded using said userscript. The rest of us can download the image with the metadata directly when it looks like that, or view it in our browsers.
###Is there another way to look at the prompt info?
[Yes](http://entropymine.com/jason/tweakpng/). You can also use it to do things like "put the metadata back" into an image if you Photoshopped it or something.
##WHY CAN'T I MAKE THE SAME EXACT IMAGE AS SO AND SO?
* Were they using LoRA or TI embeds?
Get the same ones.
* Do you have xformers enabled? Did they have xformers enabled?
>They didn't have it enabled
So disable it.
>They had it enabled (most do)
Neither of you can ever make the same image again, get over it.
> I don't know
The world is your oyster and you want to make the same image again?

#FAQ - Extensions
##How do I `2girls` in the same picture? - _What is 2Shot?_ - _What is latent couple?_
https://github.com/opparco/stable-diffusion-webui-two-shot
!!! info
	This extension is an extension of the built-in Composable Diffusion. This allows you to determine the region of the latent space that reflects your subprompts.
!!! info GrugTL _powered by GPT-4_
	* “Extension make Composable Diffusion better. Extension let you pick part of hidden space for subprompts.”
		* _it cut picture into pieces, and let user ask different things for each piece of picture_

>Line 1
Put a `2girls` prompt in here. This is the prompt for the image as a whole. Look at the examples above, and you can see that anons kept their "flavor"/quality tags in there, the desired scenery, etc. By default, the other divisions are weighted 4 times as hard, so you don't have to go too hard. The Mori/Kiara example is probably the better example here.
>Line 2, onwards
Start with `AND ` and describe each "division" of the image.

	It's probably a good time to point out that the line breaks aren't what separate the sections of your latent couple prompt
	`AND` is. You can otherwise use line breaks in your prompts for other reasons.

These are the default settings:
```

This splits the image in half, straight down the middle as seen in both examples above.

!!! note fuck math
	You can use [this](http://badnoise.net/latentcoupleregionmapper/) tool to draw your desired divisions onto a grid and just have it spit the latent couple settings out for you!

I used [this](https://jsfiddle.net/usw9jfmh/) very helpful tool made by an anon to play with the division settings and see how the split changes in real-time and to make all the screenshots you see below.

The example in the next section just so happens to split the image differently, so this topic will continue there.

>Hey, this isn't split right down the middle!

!!! warning I ain't reading all that shit
	You can use [this](http://badnoise.net/latentcoupleregionmapper/) tool to draw your desired divisions onto a grid and just have it spit the latent couple settings out for you!
	[Skip TL;DR](https://rentry.org/vtaiFAQ#ogey-how-2girls-with-lora)

-> [![Screenshot-2023-03-30-151831.png](https://i.postimg.cc/brn4zQCp/Screenshot-2023-03-30-151831.png)](https://postimg.cc/K3Z0fghH) <-
In my opinion, the way it handles the divisions and positions makes no sense whatsoever, but here is how I understood it:
> 1:1 for the first division
(almost) always. This covers the entire picture with your first line `2girls` prompt
!!! note akshully...
	There is nothing stopping you from dividing the image multiple times, and subdividing it multiple times. But I'm not about to try and explain it. You could, for example, use latent couple to split the image up into very specific regions while e.g. upscaling and "make your own" super SD Upscale. In theory at least...
> 1:1.5 and 1:3 for divisions 2 and 3
Ratio represents `y size of this division`:`x size of this division` and both numbers imply they're being compared as ratios to the height and width of the whole image, respectively.
> 1:1.5 = 1:1 y , 1:1.5 x = 100% of y, 2/3 of x
> 1:3 = 1:1y, 1:3 x = 100% of y, 1/3 of x
Yes, it's as dumb as it sounds. Had I done e.g. `2:1.5` I'd have only gotten Lamy in the top half.

-> [![Screenshot-2023-03-30-152759.png](https://i.postimg.cc/NMCrgXyJ/Screenshot-2023-03-30-152759.png)](https://postimg.cc/PpZqyPQY) <-

>OK, what about the positions?
It gets dumber
> positions=0:0,0:0,0:2
0:0 is easy enough. The origin is the top, and the left. Again, they're y:x, but now they're being compared to _the sizes of the divisions themselves_ and are **independent of the other positions**. The **only** thing the position value is compared against is the size of that particular division itself.
> 0:2 = y origin is still 0, x origin is _twice the size of the division itself away from the left_
> division is 1/3
> 2x 1/3 is 2/3
>so it's on the right, flush

And now Lamy is in the bottom half
> Positions: 0:0,1:0,0:2
Because `1:` for the second position is telling it _place this division `1 entire height of this division` away from the top of the image_
-> [![Screenshot-2023-03-30-153756.png](https://i.postimg.cc/pXMx7TrK/Screenshot-2023-03-30-153756.png)](https://postimg.cc/YjRJLt1S) <-

Here's another stupid, exaggerated example. Yes, I know it overlaps.

-> [![Screenshot-2023-03-30-153231.png](https://i.postimg.cc/CLqJQhXT/Screenshot-2023-03-30-153231.png)](https://postimg.cc/vcGW1sG3) <-
> Divisions: 1:1,1:1.5,1:4
> Positions: 0:0,0:0,0:0.5
The size of the Flare division is now 1/4 of the width of the image because of the `:4` - the `1:` only affects the height!
Because the position is in here as `0:0.5`, that means the image is 1/8th away from the left. 1/8th is half of 1/4th.

Hope you paid attention in math class!

###ogey, how `2girls` with LoRA?
Keep reading
##What is Composable LoRA?
!!! warning I'm still writing this
* Composable LoRA allows you to apply LoRA **to a specific part of the prompt**
* It also uses `AND ` just like 2shot
* It also works _with_ 2shot - you can use both at the same time

Here's a really silly example - the first time I tried using it
> can I give Watame IRyS's horns and nothing else?
Kinda
-> [![kek.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/hthGDDzC/kek.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/cvyWTNcY) <-
You don't need to see any more of my ridiculous prompts, but here's the important part:
```
big stupid prompt, silly words, center opening my beloved, booba, etc.
AND horns <lora:IRyS-2.51_6epoch:0.5>
```
The image on the right had that added to it after the long-ass prompt that was also in the image on the left. It applied the IRyS LoRA **only** to the "horns" in the prompt.

##What is ControlNet?
###whAt cONtroLneT moDel iS beSt?
!!! warning use the right tool for the job
	There is no "best" ControlNet model. Each one does something different, and is good for something else, and will work better or worse depending on the input image used.

	Yes, ControlNet means you are far more likely to get away with a higher base resolution without getting weird artifacts. I actually got better results with this particular example just generating directly at 768x1152 than I did with e.g. trying to use Hi-Res Fix on a 512x768 base gen.

####HED

	* This worked really well. The pre-processor could see the outlines we wanted it to. It worked better on Kaela, go figure.

####openpose
* For...you guessed it, copying poses.
* If you use the openpose pre-processor/module, you **should be using it on an image of real people** as that is what it was designed for.
* Otherwise, you can use an extension like [posex](https://github.com/hnmr293/posex) to manipulate your own poses.
[![Open-Pose-tmp9a3l0atp.png](https://i.postimg.cc/VsVRTjvV/Open-Pose-tmp9a3l0atp.png)](https://postimg.cc/gr38LLvV) -> [![00007-1420779218-best-quality-houshou-marine-hololive-I-m-iron-man-iron-man-cosplay-snappin.png](https://i.postimg.cc/dhVyfWg6/00007-1420779218-best-quality-houshou-marine-hololive-I-m-iron-man-iron-man-cosplay-snappin.png)](https://i.postimg.cc/Nj1k5S43/00007-1420779218-best-quality-houshou-marine-hololive-I-m-iron-man-iron-man-cosplay-snappin.png) ->
	* Again, the source material just wasn't right for the openpose pre-processor. It could see his eyes and his ears very clearly, but got thrown way off by his hand - the two lines at the bottom are where it thought his arms were. It's not a "normal" image of people, it's covered in Hollywood SFX. You'd have had better luck manually posing a stick figure using posex.
