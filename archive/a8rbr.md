##### `Her Monstrous Beauty`
She was a beast of blackness with shining red eyes, the thick matted fur on her huge breasts barely hiding her nipples. Her long canine teeth gleamed wickedly in the light of the fire she'd built, and the firelight reflected off of her voluptuous curves. The sight of her aroused all manner of primal urges in me; to fuck a wolf so huge and so heavily furred was a fantasy come true. And yet, it was her pelt that truly excited me the most. I wanted to bury myself inside the thick fur, feel it slide against my skin as she thrashed about beneath me. I wanted to plunge into the moist depths of her hot, humid mouth, and then I wanted to do it all over again. I wanted to smell the musky scent of her sex as I fucked her, and to hear the sounds of her moans as I buried myself deep within the cavernous recesses of her beautiful body.
That we were the wrong species for each other only made the experience more erotic, and heightened the sense of taboo I felt as I slid my hard length between the swollen lips of her labia. I knew that it was wrong, but it didn't matter; this was close to bestiality and the forbidden nature of it made it all the more exciting. My hands slipped up under her belly, and I grabbed hold of her heavy breasts, squeezing them and feeling their soft weight as I thrust my shaft into her velvety tunnel. I ran my fingers through her fur, enjoying the coarse texture and trying desperately to get a better grip on her. I felt the heat of her body radiating off of her, and it seemed to increase as our bodies came together. I thrust my hips forward, driving my hard member deeper into her. To penetrate a wolf felt different; I realized just how much smaller I was than her as I filled her up, and it made me feel even hornier, knowing that I was penetrating a creature that had far more physical power than I did. I began to stroke in and out of her with greater force, pounding harder and faster.

I leaned forwards, pushed my tongue deep into her throat. I tasted the saltiness of her saliva as she struggled to swallow my invading tongue. The tension began to build in my balls as I felt my orgasm approaching, but the rough fur on her huge biceps pressed into my sides as she slowed my movements, stopping me just short of coming too soon. I tried to pull back but my hands couldn't break free from the knots of her muscles; they were like a vice around them. So I simply gave in, letting go and allowing her to guide me, as she pulled back on my shaft until my glans lay nestled between the folds of her labia. She pressed me back, slowly, into her velvety sheath, spreading the walls of her vaginal canal around my shaft and stroking me deeply, coating me in her natural lubrication. I could feel her inner muscles tightening about my shaft, drawing me in, squeezing and milking me for every drop of my seed. She drew me into her, pulling me deeper and deeper, until I felt my entire length engulfed by her wet warmth as she locked her legs around me, preventing me from moving. I could feel her claws digging into my back, and I bit my lip to keep from crying out as she continued to slowly grind her pelvis against mine.

I could feel the pressure building, the walls of her vagina beginning to quiver as the wolf approached climax herself. I reached down and grabbed her huge breasts, my fingers unable to find purchase amongst the bristling fur. Her breathing became harsh and ragged, and I could feel her body tensing up, preparing itself for release. Giving a long, low, lustful growl, she wrapped one of her paws around my neck and pulled me tight against her, grinding her crotch against mine as she bucked wildly against me, her enormous breasts swaying about as she shuddered in pleasure, the muscles of her vulva contracting and releasing as wave after wave of orgasms washed over her. She released the death grip she had on my neck, her paw slipping from my cheek and falling to the ground as she relaxed, panting heavily.
I lowered myself onto my knees, looking down at her bulky form. Had I really exhausted such a huge beast? But perhaps it wasn't the size of the wolf, but rather the size of the man within her that had drained her strength; it was certainly an intense experience. I stood, my erection resting against her thighs as I took in the massive specimen of womanhood before me. I stroked the thick fur of her belly, running my hands across her stomach and feeling the ridges of her abdominal muscles as I gripped the firm flesh. She opened her arms to me, and I held her close, pressing my lips against hers and tasting the salty tang of her blood; the kiss more a caress than anything else. She pressed her huge breasts against my chest, her nipples brushing against my skin.

Daringly, I pinched the nipples of the massive werewolf, rolling them between my thumb and index finger, eliciting a gasp from the wolf. I kept rubbing her breasts, twirling my thumbs around the nipples, massaging them gently. I could feel the weight of her breasts shifting against me, and the heat of her breath on my face. I stroked my hands down her sides, feeling the heaviness of her fur as it cascaded over her ribs. The softness of her skin underneath was quite surprising, considering that her fur was so thick; I could easily feel the heavy musculature that her thick pelt only partially hid beneath, and the contours of her bones.

I pushed a hand between her legs, feeling the soft velvet that covered her mound. A muffled moan escaped her lips as I felt the softness of her pubic hair, and I ran my fingertips lightly over it, causing the wolf to begin trembling with arousal. I rubbed my thumb over her clit, and she growled at the sensation, pushing her hips towards my hand. I glanced down, watching as my digit slowly circled her little nub, and then, without hesitating, took her nub into my mouth -- the wolf yelped in surprise at this, but she quickly returned to moaning as my tongue worked its magic on her sensitive button, sucking and teasing it, my tongue flicking rapidly. She growled loudly, her paws gripping my scalp. I began to slide two of my fingers into her, curling them upwards to hit her g-spot, and she screamed out with pleasure as her hips bucked against my hand, her back arching up off the ground and her fur standing on end. I pumped my fingers into her, hardening my strokes and sliding them in deeper; she was tight, hot, and moist. I continued my ministrations, working my fingers in and out of her, feeling how soft and slick her insides were. She was quivering now, her hips bucking wildly; her body was tensing up, preparing for another orgasm, her body wracked with spasms. I felt her pulsate around my fingers as she came again, her juices flowing freely, coating my hand and smearing across my wrist. I felt her shuddering, and I knew she was starting to lose control of herself. I pulled my fingers out of her, and her body went limp, collapsing to the ground. I laid down beside her, and she curled up next to me, her head on my shoulder.

Wolves, even wolf women, cannot talk, so we had no words to share. We had nothing to say to each other, but we both understood what we meant to each other: that we were together, that we shared a bond that transcended the need for words, that we would never be alone again. After two huge climaxes, the she-beast was exhausted and still panting deeply, but I had yet to reach my own peak; I plunged my manhood back into the wolves already sopping vagina, and began to pump my shaft in and out of her, moving my hips with increased urgency as I drew closer to climax. I slammed into her, fucking her hard, the sound of our bodies together echoing in the small clearing. She wrapped her arms around me, burying her muzzle in my neck, and began to lick my skin, her lips tickling my earlobe. I rolled her over onto her back, and she smiled up at me with her big red eyes as I took her by the hips and began to pound her, driving my shaft as deep into her as possible. Using her huge paws, she delicately scratched at my back, encouraging me on, and I could feel the strong musculature of her hands as they dug into my shoulders, and I felt myself reaching the edge of climax. I rose up onto my feet, my hands bracing against the ground, and then I drove my hips down against her, slamming deep into her as I came inside her, shooting rope after rope of my seed deep inside her, filling her womb with every last drop of my semen. I collapsed down onto the earth, gasping for breath, and she brought her lips to mine once again, kissing me passionately.

And this was enough. As the moon rose overhead, we slept, content to know that we were together. Her arm was thrown over my chest, my leg was draped over hers, and we drifted off to sleep; man and beast still locked together, sharing the night sky above us, our limbs entwined, still joined intimately by our sexes. In the morning, we would leave this place behind, and continue on to somewhere new, where we might start a new life, or maybe never be found out, and live in peace forevermore... Or not. It was impossible to say. All I knew, as the warm sun began to rise above the horizon, was that we were safe, and that we would remain so for as long as we chose.
