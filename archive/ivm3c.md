######Chihiro Mitsurugi
Her quirk’s a hungry bastard and I’m not sure it’d be usable even after I practiced with it. The quirk seems to be most useful to someone who is a master swordsman or otherwise martially inclined. And I am not.

######Shoujyuuro Imai
I really REALLY wish he wasn’t afraid of me blabbing about his quirk. It seems like it’d be amazing in a fight. For now I’ll just live without it.

######Bobby Samson
Needs times to build up, so I’d have to go into a situation having already charged Bobby’s quirk. Also it makes me act like a show-off, not for me.

######Sora Tanaka
This quirk’s one of my favorites. I made a massive mistake during the hero training skirmish by not better exploiting what it could do with terrain.

######Kaylee Suzuki
Mutant, flying brick

######Lenny Maxwell
Rosethorn-sensei apparently knocked me out when I used his quirk. Had to promise not to do that again. I haven’t but I’m curious what I did.

######Shinkan Sen
Body enhancement, fueled by… coal? No.

######Hifumi Takeda
Staple quirk in my repertoire. Because I can drop his quirk when I blink I can use it as honest-to-God teleportation. Fantastic escape. Fantastic defensive. I love this quirk.

######Minerva Kim
I can shoot things.

######Hailey Chang
Has my mom’s quirk… that makes me feel-- I hope my great-grandpa wasn’t in Korea.

######Faith Kang
Extraordinarily useful, but I’m stuck with the quirk until I deactivate the servitors. They go… haywire if their maker no longer has the quirk.

######Maxine Nguyen
Great for multi-tasking!

######Edith Lee
Border-line. Fucking. Cheating. I love it.

######Noah Abrams
Mutant, flying blaster

######Victor Sigurd
Hydrokinesis seems absurdly useful AND he can use it to heal himself? I need to practice with this quirk! 

######Inigo Myoga
Fuck. This. Quirk.

######Damien Jackson
Decent for predicting what’s coming, but it’s really REALLY hard to change what’s coming. As in, I haven’t been able to successfully change the outcomes, fate keeps rubber banding me into the same position I saw in my vision. It feels like there’s a way to change what’s coming but I haven’t figured it out. Moderately useful but I’d prefer Imai’s.

######Son Jugo
I can turn into a flying blaster. Moderately useful, but I don’t have the endurance to be a clay pigeon. 

######Genma Go
It seems like an upgrade to Hifumi’s quirk SURE. But… I don’t like sentai.

######Ashleigh Katsuragi
Basically forces my drawback on other people. Not bad. Not everyone’s experienced with memory loss so it could be a nice trump card when I’m heading into tricky situations.

######Atsushi Orochi
Mutant, Hydra

######Johnny Walker
This quirk just feels dirty.

######Yui Sagara
Her quirk isn’t powerful on its own, she’s had to work her ass off to make this usable. Does make it unusable for me though.

######Kyoda Hiro
I genuinely don’t even know where to begin. Almost everything’s doable with this quirk but using it makes me feel like a criminal.

######Mochi Uranus
He looks at you, you taste diahrrea, you vomit, you keep tasting it, you keep vomiting. The only thing keeping me from making this a permanent part of my repertoire is… Japan has a lot of perverts. I’m worried I’d use this on someone who’d be into it and not feel clean for weeks.

######Kevin Rool
I’m a dragon now.

######William Dustice
Mutant, monkey man

######Johanna Hilt
I NEVER have gauntlets on me. I would definitely take it whenever I had one though.

######Sandatsu Owari
I don’t know what his does! I copied it and nothing happened. He has one I’m sure of it. I felt the mirror anyway.

######Maru
I wish it was completely passive. I could sleep all day and not get any shit for it. 


What personalities? What do I think when I see them? Well, in order.
