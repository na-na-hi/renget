##Jiang Mei:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xti_6Bzpa8A
She was kind of hard to get a music for and the fact it ended being THIS ONE is very ironical.
She was a normal office lady before getting to meet Lucia, so she became a fanger. I think this song reflects well the duality of Jiang. Now a "demon" who hunts other demons in the night, passing the righeous justice unto them, as well as being a damned creature herself.

"My chosen torture makes me stronger
In a life that craves the hunger
A Freedom and a quest for life
Until the end the judgment night

Bless me with your gift of lights
Righteous cause on judgment nighs
Feel the sorrow the light has swallowed
Feel the freedom like no tomorrow
Stepping forth a cure for soul's demise
Reap the tears of the victims cries
Yearning more to hear the suffer (of a)
Of a demon as I put it under

Killed before, a time to kill them all
Passed down the righteous law
Serve a justice that dwells in me
Lifeless corpse as far as the eye can see"

Fits well in her M.O when hunting. Some parts of the song, "Praise to my father, blessed by the waters", "The Light is calling" doesn't fit at all at first. In my interpretation, Father, the light, wouldn't be her parents but rather the Flame itself. It is "calling her", pleading for her to find it, join it. Despite being touched by the Darkness, she refuses its calling and the oblivious cold of its maw, fighting against it.
I like to think that the "Father" in the last parts of the song being the Flame itself wanting Jiang to join it, embrace it and let darkness be gone.

"Crown me with the pure green leaf", "Bless me with the leaf off of the tree", being her human self, wanting solace, or purifying herself as well as the bits of the Father representing the flame. The demonic voice being herself accepting her condition and that there is "No way out" of her situation. "Steal a Soul for a second chance but you will never become a man". She accepted that there is no way out of her situation, just accept it and go on.

##David
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyfV0GBe18w 
For a moment I really thought of using My Demons as his theme, but it didn't fit since he doesn't want "salvation" or be "saved from himself", for what I understood of his backstory, he is perfectly okay on where he is, he just wants vindication.

So Monster for him. At first I thought of using this song for Jiang, but it didn't fit but for him, it fits like a glove.

"Under the knife I surrendered
The innocence yours to consume
You cut it away
And you filled me up with hate

Into the silence you sent me
Into the fire- consumed
You thought I'd forget
But it's always in my head

You're the pulse in my veins
You're the war that I wage.
Can you change me?
Can you change me?

From the monster you made me"

This shit is the spitting iamge of him and his relationship with his father. Him wanting or not is the same type of monster of his father. Maybe he is self-aware, maybe he is not, either way it fits him. Althought the "Monster always win" part has yet to be realized, I think the song works either him. His war and reason to live, to bring his father to face justice, fits well. "You are the war I wage, you are the drug I take".

It fits him, although in a more darker twist due to the lyrics of the song. I think it would fit him if he starts to lose options and have to go for the option of killing his father, becoming a true monster.

Overall I think it works better if David go for the bad ending, but it can still be his theme

Can someone save him if he ends as his demons?

##Vanity bright:

Contrary to David who has at least a "thematic" for I to work with, she has none, which makes finding a theme for her very hard. More so because I do no want to use Devil May Cry OSTs so soon after using one.

I think it fits her "sword beam" and "boomstick" style. I wanted to say more but there is nothing more, sadly. Maybe after she gets more writefags I change the theme for having more material on her personality and M.O.

##Asahi:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mjlM_RnsVE
It was hard but enjoyable to find a theme for him. However I didn't expected THIS to be his theme.

He has a very bad case of suppressed rage, and he builds up negative emotions inside of him but never release them.

I feel the "time bomb" vibes of Monster to fit him perfectly, also: Another music named Monster. The way I see it is that his emotions build up while he holds them back, until they reach the boiling point that even his inner walls can't hold back.

The fact that he still is a "little boy" inside:
>Somewhere in there, deep inside, is a boy who isn't strong enough to deal with all that Asashi needs to. There is no need for them anymore.
Gives more credibility to the repressed rage building inside of him until it explodes. The deeper "I feel like a Monster" would be perfect for this moment, the moment he can no longer hold back the flood of his own rage and trauma and they come searing hot under his skin.

I wasn't in my plans to use this music as a theme for someone, but it surprised me that Asahi fits it, at least in my view of someone who is holding back his inner-self and demons.They are bond to break free.

##Andrea:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8-GPWk-0Og

What kickstarted my effort. This music fits her well, be free and live your best.

"Which dream should we go see?
Don't be afraid simply because of certainty.

Skip about freely.
Step by step,
carve yourself into the beat.
Shall we continue
this endless party?

Jump upon this era.
Tonight, jump from this city.
Fly about the vast sky.
Rock your life, rock your life"

Shit things happens in life but you shouldn't go and simply give up. Despite its hardships, there are genuinely good things about life and drmeam. Although it is hard, sometimes you just have to deal with you have. The world isn't going to change, and you have to cope with the time we live in but it wasn't all that bad, live your best, live your life cheerfully and you will be doing good despite hardships. Something something fuck well adjusted people

"Jump upon the wind.
Tonight, become the nameless breeze.
Unite both good and evil.
Rock your life, rock your life."

This may be strange at first, but ties back to what I said above. Life is hard, and it is going to suck sometimes. Sometimes all you can do is live through it, despite misery and good tidings. Live as freely as you can, and live as happily as you can, and you will be good. This is what I get from her. A happy and free person despite life's adversity and hardships.

##Druella
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXB26PzV31k

I think this one to have a different vibe and meaning in comparisson to the ones I posted. Rather than a theme song I think this would be a song Druella would "sing".

I think the way no one never believed her about the thing that took the place of her mother, the way she never lets anyone to get close to her. I think her emotions can be transmitted through this song rather than serving as a theme? Like when you are in so much pain and you hear sad songs and try to sing them despite slipping some part of the lyrics through your sobbing and tears making hard to keep yourself concentrated.

When you have to sing in almost silence, trying to get the words out of your mouth yet trying to make no song at all, to not awake anyone in the house or make people alarmed at your outburst.

This type of song. A song that lets Druella put her soul, her emotions, herself into the lyrics and let loose. Sad, melancholic but with an once of hope. As Calli said in the premiere, "it is okay to be sad when a story ends".

This wouldn't be the end of her story, but the end of a chapter in her life, when she broke free of that thing's influence, when she got to be her own person despite the problems. When she was able to sing at the top of her longs without having to worry. When she was able to make justice (I think, since I do not have the full puzzle, I like to think Druella avenged her mother) for her true mother. This type of thing.

Rather than a lyric breakdown, I think it is more of an emotional breakdown? I dunno, I just get this feeling. I really like Druella also, this may play a factor. If you reading this, Druella Anon, do not give up, I want to read more about your character.

##Lyra:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1n7AOGH4Js

I saved this for her. The moment I read her build for the first time I knew what music to use as her theme.

Really, this song encompasses her "insides". She is barely keeping herself together as rage consumes her, all to avenge that fateful day, all to fuck Mimi over. Really- I can barely explain.

"I wake up every morning with my head up in a daze
I'm not sure ifIshould say this,fuck, I'll say it anyway
Everybody triesto tell me that I'm goin' through a phase
I don't know if it's a phase, I just wanna feel okay, yeah
I battle with depression, but the question still remains
Is this post-traumatic stressin' or am I suppressin' rage?
And my doctor tries to tell me that I'm going through a phase
Yeah, it's not a fuckin' phase, I just wanna feel okay"

This is a mood and I'm sure Lyra is struck with this wanting every single moment of her life after Whateley University. She is becoming a monster herself- Using people like puppets, playing a game to reacxh Mimmi, seeing assets and not faces, seeing another step in her stairway towards her vengeance.

She is becoming a creature much like the one she loathes right now. I'm here for it, also this music has a neat line:

"Yeah, here we go again, motherfucker, oh
We're sick and tired of wondering
Praying to a god that you don't believe
You're searching for the truth in the lost and found
So the question I ask is, oh, where the fuck is your god now?"

This music is perfect for her. Well, to the next character.

##Daniel:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3L3R0o3PEyQ

Much like Lyra, I already kept this one in store for him. Like Druella, I thing this song would be perfect for Daniel to sing it, as well as serving as his theme this time.

He fell in a bad crowd and lost his way in life for a time but he found it in religion and the right people.

I thnik this song reflects it real good with the message.

"I’m just the boy inside the man
Not exactly who you think I am
Trying to trace my steps back here again so many times
I’m just a speck inside your hand
You came and made me who I am
I remember where it all began so clearly"

"I feel a million miles away
Still you connect me in your way
And you create in me
Something I would’ve never seen
When I could only see the floor
You made my window a door
So when they say they don’t believe
I hope that they see you in me
After all the lights go down
I’m just the words you are the sound
A strange type of chemistry
How you’ve become a part of me
And when I sit alone at night
Your thoughts burn through me like a fire
You’re the only one who knows who I really am"

This entire section sells it foor me. The people who made him could be many, his grandpa who served as his inspiration when he was young, it could be Reverend Matthew Williams, it could be Reverend Isaac Belmont, it could even be God. "So when they say they don't believe I hope they see you in me" could be anyone that inspired him and molded him into the man he is now, the person he is. Despite being a good music, I think it fits very well, he found his way, he found who he is. HE IS SOMEBODY, and now like the ones who helped him in the past, is his time to help people find who they really are.

##Lewis:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx2q_gtc8T0
This was solely based on my preference, just slap anything Powerwolf related and this bad boy is good to go. DOGS ARE ALWAYS USEFUL IN MONSTER HUNTING BUSINESS!

He took this lesson to his heart, nothing better than use Powerwolf. Nothing more to say, that motherfucker is a gigachad. Soon he will have evangelist werewolves under his banner, as God intended.

##Nicole:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQKGUgOfD8U

While I had another song in store for her, I thought of it as needlessy dark and that would bring the mood of the thread down, so I changed it. I think his song encapsulates well the life of NEET without life like her, without offense. She i s a NEET, lost all of her parents, has zero life skills, I would say she would be on the middle of breaking down (Or so numb that she believes herself to not be breaking down). She has We Are Legion, so "burning my house down into an ugly black and never look back" can take a very destructive and dark turn.

Although interesting, is hard to find her a theme due to the fact her only important trait is being a NEET. Maybe I should've used a Yumi Nikki OST instead?

##Evalina:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ar2iBWIQJg8

This music fits, although not as agood as the one Eva anon chose since I'm not him and do not know the character to the same extent as him.
She is on the warpath and is an yandere. I think this reflects it nicely. "I ruminate defeat, I never lose, it is true!"

"In the feeling and repeating
Yeah, even love won’t save you
When you’re runnin’ from the scene
Pain and meaning, no relieving
Just wanna cry, cry, cry"

This music fits well, as well as her more yandere-ish tendencies in a possible suitor. "To adore you, illuminate you."

##Samuel:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRsm8JksmKM

I think this music fits him quite nicely. After all shit he has been through, the incident that almost killed him, and have to contend with the greatest evil of all: Taxes, he would want some peace of mind and time for himself. After all shady bosses, supernatural creatures and mundane life, I think taking a time to enjoy and be himself would be something he would crave.

The music being something like this, getting away from stress inducing topics and just take a time for his hobbies and to not worry, relax.

##Vernon:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fps4oP_u_xA [Embed]
Although one of the strangest choices thus far, it will make sense, believe me.

In my vision, I see Vernon as someone trapped in the beginning (using the lyrics as a base to try and guess his full backstory), by the tragedy and the encroaching Darkness, more so due to the fact he works with the dead. Someome trapped in a veil of tragedies and sorrow, unable to get out.

As he is forced to stare into the abyss, he is also forced to stare at the bonfire. Something forcing him, or maybe awakening in him, to drive him into the fight against the Darkness. Instead of sulkin g in the dark and cold night, he takes up the torch of hope and carries on to the metaphorical and physical battlefield against evil.

Breeaking the chains of tragedy that bounds him, undoing the cold grasp on his body. Which is ironical since he is a person with the powers of cold, yet he carries a flame within him. A flame to burn away the touch of the dark. Maybe he was alone at first— Who knows how his life was after the accident of his mother and her eventual death? Who can know?

He survived the night, with a new mindset in mind. He came for help within the Asylum, maybe he already had connections there, maybe he was one like Alexander and got recruited on a very specific situation. Either way, he found an organization, people who can help him understand and fight the Evil in Dunwich. He was neither alone nor "cold" anymore, if you understand what I'm saying.

I don't have the full view of the character's past nor personality, so please correct me if I said any bullshit about your character, it is just my interpretation using the song as a base for it.
