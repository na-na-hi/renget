**Current Slots** | 
:----: | 
People who entered with drawing: 0/5  | 
People who entered with generation: 0/5   |
!!! info I will be adding slots as I see fit to keep more people. This is a test for the moment.

!!! danger You cannot share tokens, any attempt to share a token that you manage to see will end up in blacklist.

## Requirements
There are 2 different ways to have a token for my proxy...
These two methods DO NOT GUARANTEE you a token, but they do guarantee you a chance to enter. You can send your submission in my burner `SmileyTatsu@proton.me` or in Discord direct message `smileytatsu`, whichever is more convenient for you.

If you don't get an answer from me soon consider two possible outcomes
1. You simply didn't fulfill all the requirements I mention here.
2. There are not enough slots. You need a Discord account if you want to the waiting list.

!!! info
	By sending me one of your drawings, you agree that I can show it publicly in my rentries or send it in different places. It is your responsibility if you want to add a signature inside the drawing or not, I will only give the name of the author inside Rentry.

You can make your token last longer by submitting a new submission at the end of your token's lifetime. If you send a submission before your token dies you will have priority and you can continue with your token without waiting on the waiting list.

### Drawing Tatsumaki
This guarantees you a token from 2 to 4 weeks, depending on the quality I consider within the drawing. Unlike my old proxy, this time I will only be accepting medium to decent quality or that you can tell that I tried to put a minimum of effort into the drawing.
Requirements for your image to be counted as valid:
- It must be **clearly noted** that the main character in the image is Tatsumaki (extra characters give more points but nothing confirmed).
- It can be a sketch or a complete drawing, but **the more complete the drawing the longer the token I will give you**.
- If you use any **extra** tool, like an AI model, specify it.
- You must include a signature (by hand) that says "SmileyTatsu" on it.
- In case it is a digital drawing, send the drawing file to verify it, if it is a hand drawing it is not necessary to send anything extra.

!!! warning	If the drawing does not have a signature it will not be counted as valid. If you are caught stealing drawings you will be blacklisted.

### Genning Tatsumaki
By "generate Tatsumaki" I mean use an image generation template for this job, the style of the image doesn't matter much to me but I will be much stricter with these images to get a token, and the time limit will be 2 weeks at most.
Requirements for your image to be counted as valid:
- It must be **clearly noted** that the main character in the image is Tatsumaki (extra characters give more points but nothing confirmed).
- You must specify **all the settings** used, prompt, sampler, steps, seed, etc.
- You must specify **the specific version** of the model used and tools you used (if you used only generation, img2img, inpaint, etc).
- You must specify if you edited the final image.
- The more **unique** the generation is, the longer the token will last.

!!! warning	This type of submission will give you tokens with a maximum duration of 1 to 2 weeks if you meet all the requirements, the token may last longer if the generation had a long and elaborate creation process (please specify each step). 

### Other characters
These are other characters I will be accepting for proxy access, for those who don't like Tatsumaki (bad taste ngl). Same requirements and times as with Tatsumaki.
- Hadou Nejire (BNHA)
- Rouge the bat (Sonic)
- Lucoa (Maid Dragon)

You can try to send other characters, but there is no guarantee to get access.
