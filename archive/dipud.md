###Beast

>Male Munchlax. Serious Nature. 
>Age: 51
>Arrogant, conceited, and hideously overqualified, Beast Winchester begun his work at the guild after his five star restaurant burned down in a freak accident, and is currently working to incur a mountain of debt. Contrary to his species, Beast is incredibly picky, judgmental, and bitter, and generally struggles to socialize with people outside of his comfort zone. Unfortunately, this is best seen as Beast constantly struggles to keep his temper around among the immature buzzword-spitting 4chan browsers that populate the guild.

>However, Beast does indeed hold up to his previous occupation as a very talented chef when he is not held back by the limited equipment provided to him by the guildmaster. He is very knowledgeable of the chemistry of food and various improvised cooking methods, and keeps an unexpectedly open mind about human food.

>As much as he wants to forget, Beast has no civilized origins. Beast lived as a child in an unknown forest and left in the search of high quality food after rejecting the vines and moldy food his mother tried to offer him. He gained knowledge and skills from various mentors over his life and eventually rose to celebrity chef status, giving himself the last name Winchester because it made him sound sophisticated.

>Beast speaks in a noble dialect akin to a Boston Aristocrat, often referring to people by the long versions of their names (e.g. saying Ronald rather than Ronnie) and generally avoids using contractions (e.g. Do not rather than Don't)
