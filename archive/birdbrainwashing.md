>"P’ting!"
>a small red light on the wall above your head turns on, accompanied by the soft pinging sound that alerts when you are being summoned
>the door to your storage closet slides open with a hiss and you step outside into the hallway
>you turn and march down the hall to the living room, where the summons came from
>when you step in, mistress is seated on her chair
>there are two others in the room on the couch opposite her
>you focus on your mistress
>you march to the chair and take your place beside it
>then you turn your head to the side to look over at her
"Mistress."
>your mistress laughs and gestures at you
>she speaks to the others in the room
>"See? Totally obedient. Servant, introduce yourself to my guests."
>you look up, then over, to the others
>one is the same species as mistress, an avian with mostly gray feathers, highlighted by darker grays and slate colored feathers
>unlike mistress's dark brown with white and black at the edge of her wings
>the guest's beak is shorter, and more rounded than mistress's pointed beak
>and her hands lack mistress's augmented talontips
>the other is not avian at all, a cephalopod-being with ice blue skin, mottled in darker blues, and looking slightly reflective as though wet
>it has a multitude of tentacles instead of arms and legs
"Hello. I am Mistress Krawka's servant."
>you turn your gaze forward between the guests
>awaiting further orders
>mistress ignores you as she goes on speaking with her guests
>"The thing cost me quite a bit just for the flesh. Worth every credit."
>the avian guest stares at you
>her beak chatters
>"Never seen one of those before. What is he?"
>mistress laughs
>"I’m not shocked. It’s called a human. The Lupans snatched up most of them from their homeworld."
>the cephalopod speaks up next
>"It’s a miracle there are any left at all, if the Lupans got their claws in them."
>mistress laughs again
>"No, no. The Lupans liked them, I hear."
>the avian guest gasps
>"No!"
>mistress laugh again
>she flutters her wings
>"Yes! I know, it was quite the scandal. The 'scourge of the galaxy' shacking up with a primitive species. Apparently they think humans are cute."
>mistress and her guests laugh
>the avian guest leans forward to look at you again
>"Really? Looks ugly to me. All skin. And so shrimpy."
>the cephalopod burbles
>a tentacle rubbing around its bulbous head
>"What good is a human servant? Certainly not for hard labor."
>Mistress kicks her feet out, flexing the talons
>"Servant, footrest."
"Yes mistress."
>you drop to your hands and knees and crawl on all fours around the chair until you are in place for mistress to use you as a footrest
>her claws digging into your bare back as they assume a perching position
>you can not feel the pain
>mistress's guests continue laughing
>"Ka-ha-ha! That's a funny trick, Krawka, but I have furniture at home for that."
>mistress's laughter slows
>she chirps
>"That's not all it's good for. Watch."
>mistress kicks you over, and you topple to the floor
>"Servant, claws."
>you pick yourself up
"Yes mistress."
>you go to retrieve mistress's claw care kit from your closet
>mistress and her guests are laughing
>you return with the kit and kneel down in front of mistress
>she presents a foot to you, which you take with one hand
>with the other you retrieve a fine file and begin working on her claws
>you work slowly from claw to claw
>filing them down to even out the slightly rough edges of the keratin
>then you take a stiff brush and begin brushing the surface of the claws
>mistress sighs
>"They have these small, slender fingers. Perfect for this kind of thing."
>the avian guest chirps quickly in rapid succession
>"Oh now that would be nice..."
>the cephalopod burbles
>"A personal groomer? That's all? There are machines that do that. Machines you don't have to feed or train."
>you move on to the polish
>applying a veneer of the clear, viscous fluid, and then brushing with a final soft brush
>all three digits and the hallux of one foot
>all three digits and the hallux of the other foot
>you pack up the tools into the claw care kit bag and set it aside
>you remain on your knees to await further orders
>"Oh it's much more than that. He fucks too."
>"Ack!"
>mistress's guests make uncomfortable sounds
>the cephalopod gurgles
>the avian makes coughing, crowing sounds
>mistress titters and flexes her talons in front of your face
>"Servant. Lick."
>you take the foot in your hands
>and open your mouth to begin running your tongue up the underside of her foot
>up each toe and back down
>mistress kicks her foot free and replaces it with the other
>"Suck."
>you suck on her middle toe
>mistress goes on talking while you cycle through each on
>"Any order, it follows. He'll eat me out for hours if I tell him to."
>mistress's cephalopod guest moves behind you
>"I think I have some work I need to catch up on. Have a good evening Miss Krawka, Miss Wikaki."
>the front door hisses open to allow the cephalopod to leave
>and hisses shut as it closes automatically behind him
>you are still sucking mistress's toes
>Wikaki chirps
>"How did you train him so well? Is that why he cost so much?"
>mistress pulls her talon out of your mouth and pushes you away with her foot
>"Servant, clean."
>you stand and start picking up the living room
>first you put away the claw kit
>"Oh no, it came untrained. Humans are just so rare outside their own. They say this one  ran away from the others."
>you start picking up the emptied glasses and dishes in the living room
>you move them to the kitchen to put them in the washing appliance
>"It was so much trouble until I had an inhibitor installed."
>Wikaki squawks
>"An inhibitor?"
>mistress chirps
>"Had it put in after the first week. It was always squawking in its tongue and trying to run away. Much easier this way."
>finished with cleaning you return to mistress's side
>she ignores you while Wikaki is speaking
>"That must have cost a fortune! Was it worth it over normal training?"
>mistress laughs
>"Oh definitely. You should have heard it screaming and crying. Even shock training didn't help. Here, let me show you.
>mistress clears her throat
>"Inhibitor override code five-one-three-three-zero-six. Inhibitor shut-down."
>you blink
>eyes adjusting naturally for the first time in ages
>you groan in sudden pain
>your body aches all over, and your knees shake weakly
>you recognize where you are
>this is the home of that alien that bought you
>who...who...
>you turn and see her staring at you
>those eyes cold and uncaring
>like she's looking at an animal
>immediately your stomach turns with revulsion
>she did it
>they put that fucking mind control in your head
"Oh god."
>your stomach churns and you retch from sheer revulsion
>doubled over you try to get away from her
>but your legs stumble, weak and clumsy
"Fuck! Fuck fuck fuck! Get away from me!"
>you start to turn and try to crawl away when you see another one of the bird women
>she looks scared
>maybe sympathetic
>you can't get away from that psychopath in this state, but maybe this stranger will help you
"H-hey! You, please! You have to help me."
>crawling towards her, you reach out for help
>but the stranger shies away, pulling her hand away from you
>"What's it saying?"
>she's not talking to you
>she's talking to the psycho
"Please! Please god don't let her put me under! I'd rather die!"
>you make another feeble attempt at reaching out before falling to the floor
>"Who knows. Its language isn't integrated with any translators."
>they can't understand you
>but you can understand them
>she called you 'it'
>even the stranger is disgusted by you
>fear and sickness boil into explosive rage
"You--you bitch!"
>you turn toward the psychopath who enslaved you
"I'll kill you! I'll get out and I'll cut your fucking--"
>"Inhibitor override code five-one-three-three-zero-six. Inhibitor initialize."
>your vision narrows
>the icy grip of fear settling in your heart once again
>not the breakneck panic of confusion and panic
>but the bitter dread of the inevitable
>your heart rate slows
>your limbs straighten out
>thoughts fading away
>screaming empty defiance that echoes for a longue moment in the forefront of your mind
>until it is totally shut out
>you are lying on the floor in front of mistress and her guest
>"Servant. Here."
>you pick yourself up and return to mistress's side
>Wikaki chirps lowly
>"I see what you mean about the noise."
>mistress points to the spot in front of her
>"Kneel. I know, it'll have to make up for the trouble. Thankfully its fingers aren't the only thing that's good about it."
>you kneel in front of mistress and she spreads her legs
>she unzips her leisure jumpsuit all the way down, exposing herself to you
>"Lick."
>you start to lick her vulva
>mistress rests a claw on your head and sighs
>"Ah, there it is."
>she sighs and chirps
>you keep licking
>Wikaki moves behind you, and her voice is closer
>"Wow, look at him go. I should get one of my own..."
>mistress laughs
>"You should! They're worth every credit, dear. Worth every credit."
