Carrie stared through familiarity even as she held uncertainty in her grip. The scope was an old hat, worn around the knobs from months of live combat; the gun it was attached to was a different beast entirely. Even after trying it out for several weeks and knowing it was the right choice, the reserve GUN operative didn't really know or like the Wispon. It had no kick, it didn't need adjustment for wind, and it was near-silent compared to the blast of a shell. All of those should have been fantastic qualities, but after going through the rebel war against Eggman with tried and true gunpowder, it felt wrong.

Maybe she'd get used to it during this new war.

The smoke rising around the city didn't cloud her vision, she knew well how to find the high-rises that weren't aflame and how to line herself up with her targets. Eggman had dropped out of a hole in the sky with a mech bearing his signature style. The logo, though, was slightly off; the mustache design was angled differently and there were eyelash marks now. Right now, Carrie was watching helplessly as that spider-esque robot picked it's way through the city block by block. Every so often she had to scoot to get a better angle, watching the progress of the metal armada and the occasional opening of new portals in the sky. 

Her job here was simple: watch and learn. Sonic would be on his way soon enough, and GUN wanted someone in the field to watch the showdown. In the meantime, she was making regular reports to her field commander and noting everything she could about the new tech on display. The teleportation portals weren't exactly a new concept, but they seemed larger scale than ever before and all the Chaos Emeralds were currently missing. That signaled either a golden boy flying in any second, or they'd have to track down a flying island to counteract the madness about to be unleashed. The third option was that neither side yet had the gems, but why would they not have taken the time to find their most powerful weapons again?

These were the thoughts that Carrie processed while watching civilians try and fail to evacuate. Any who were at risk of being stomped were pulled away by robots, dragged kicking and screaming out of direct harm and into prison canisters. Somebody would have to bust them out...

"Recon Team, report?"

"It's not a team if I'm only one person. I've got eyes on the mech."

"Confirm ID?"

That was strange. This was so obviously...

"Negative, Pilot is still in-" She cut herself off with an "oh", watching as a hatch atop the spider-mech opened and a figure emerged. "Here they come... that's not Eggman. Repeat, that is NOT Eggman!"

Well, unless he'd lost several hundred pounds and was putting on a drag show this time. Wouldn't be the strangest thing, but there was always the chance...

"Command, do we have confirmation of Phantom Ruby energy?"

"Negative, Recon. Chaos Energy and Ruby power are both at expected levels."

Then there wasn't a good explination for the human emerging from her mech. She was as tall as Eggman, but slender where he was fat. The luxurious hair was a dead ringer for the mustache she knew, the goggles were the same- the style was the same- nearly everything was the same!

But it was a woman, and there was an air around her that was somehow more threatening than the usual fat bastard. She surveyed the flaming carnage around her like she was expecting something to rise up, hoping for something to crush. The missing piece that separated that look from the man Carrie knew was the anger, or rather, the lack of it. There was a stoicism where there should have been irritation or rage. Whoever this was, they weren't bitter and coming back for another round. Carrie unconciously trilled, pushing air through her beak in a sharp whistle of warning. 

Nobody else would have heard it. Her old friends were gone, drifted away after the last war. Nobody that did catch that whistle would understand what it meant, which meant they didn't hear it at all, really. 

Except somebody did hear. That somebody was the female version of Eggman, who casually pulled a rocket launcher from within the spider-mech's confines and aimed it towards the bird's position. By the time she realized what was happening, the rocket was already blowing her away. 

Her next memories had her on the ground, scrambling on hands and knees and carrying a mangled rifle in one arm as she escaped the robot army. Contact with GUN was severed until she could link up with a rendevous, but did that even matter? This was just like when Eggman had "killed" Sonic: chaos reigned and not the type that came from gems.

"Here we go again..."
