>You're in Koyori's lab in the HoloX headquarters
>She invited you here for a trial run of a new concoction she's been developing
>She was pretty secretive about what it was actually supposed to do, but she sounded pretty excited and you are physically unable to turn down a cute girl
>So here you are, sat at the edge of a wheeled hospital bed as the coyote scientist brandishes a test tube of red liquid in your general direction
>"Here you go, Anon! Drink up and let me know what happens. As thorough as possible; this is science, after all!"
>You gingerly accept the offering, and she sits back in her office chair, wheeling a couple steps away to grab a clipboard and pen off a cluttered table
>Truth be told, you're nervous as hell, but you trust Koyori enough to go through with it anyway
>Ignoring the slight tremble in your arm, you pop the cork and down the contents
>It's vaguely sweet, with an aftertaste of maraschino cherry

>Almost immediately, a warmth begins to spread through your body from your stomach
"Okay, I feel... warm, like it's spreading out in a wave."
>Koyori rasies an eyebrow and frowns slightly as she writes this down
>oh_no.rtf
>Still though, it's not altogether unpleasant. In fact, it almost feels like-
>It reaches your crotch, and all of a sudden you've got one of the biggest erections you've ever had
>It painfully throbs in your pants and Koyori notices before you can hide it, her expression of mild concern turning to dread
>The wave of warmth reaches your head and you can now accurately identify this feeling
"And... horny. A lot, actually."

>Koyori unceremoniously drops the clipboard and stands up, reaching for the rack of test tubes she pulled your sample from
>She inhales sharply as she reads the label, then exclaims it aloud
>"Aphrodisiac."
>She slams it back down to the table hard enough to shake it, rapidly cursing under her breath
>"Why the hell was that there?! It was supposed to be a super strength serum! I swear that was where I left it last night! Did Chloe-? I told her not to touch the desks when she cleaned!"
>She tromps to an open textbook on another table, snatching it up and rapidly flipping through the pages.
>"Okay. Okay. I can fix this, Anon. I just need to make an anaphrodisiac to cancel it out. There should be one-"
>She stops flipping, stares at the list of ingredients for a solid ten seconds, then throws the book down to the floor
>"I RAN OUT OF THAT LAST WEEK!"

>You don't trust yourself to say or do anything, staying stock still and watching Koyori panic
>Quite literally all you want to do in this moment is fuck her
>She stares at your uncontrollable bulge, deep in thought
>"I can't just- they can't find out I screwed up this bad. I'm gonna have to fix this somehow."
>A blush starts to creep up her cheeks, and she takes off her lab coat, hanging it on the coat rack by the door
>"...Sit back, Anon. I think it's time for some physical therapy."
>Understanding her meaning immediately, you lay back in the bed and unbuckle your pants, freeing your massive member from its confines
>Koyori hesitates as she sees it, but steels herself and starts taking off her tie as well
>As she unceremoniously tosses it away somewhere, the rack of aphrodisiacs catches her eye
>...
>"Fuck it. Might as well even the playing field."
>She grabs a test tube off the rack, pops the cork and swallows the potion, and approaches you with a glint in her eye

･ﾟ: *･ﾟ:* and then they fucked *:･ﾟ*:･ﾟ

>Nearly two hours later
>You're both exhausted, completely naked and cuddling each other on the tiny bed
>There are juices everywhere, from both of you; the bed's sheets are utterly soaked, both of you are shiny from head to toe, and the floor nearby is undoubtedly some unholy slipping hazard
>You can't remember how many times you came, not that you were particularly invested in keeping track
>The aphrodisiacs are finally wearing off, and you can tell that your frenzied fornication fest has come to an end
>You tap your partner lightly on her hip where your hand lay
"Hey, Koyori."
>She opens her eyes halfway from where she was dozing to meet your gaze with a soft "mm?"
"Can we, uh, do this again sometime? If you don't mind."
>"...Don't count on it, you perv. And not in the lab. Too many chemicals around."
"Works for me. Your room, then?"
>"I just said- yeah, okay. Maybe in a couple days, I'm beat."
"Sure thing, Koyo."
>You fall into a comfortable silence, both dimly aware that you should probably start cleaning but too tired and satisfied to actually do anything about it
>Until the door clicks open and Lui walks in
>"Koyori, have you-"
>"WAIT DON'T- AAH!"
>In her panic to turn around and face the intruder, Koyori slips and falls off the bed, crashing painfully to the floor
>Lui stops in her tracks, staring at the scene...
>"...ah, sorry."
>...and walks out, closing the door behind her
