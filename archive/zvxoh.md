Inch by inch, Chloe crawled her way through the complex’s cramped labyrinth of ventilation shafts. This was easily her least favorite method of infiltration; it was too tight, too dark, and much too hot. She paused, brushed her sweaty bangs from her face, and peered down through one of the many horizontal grates lining the duct’s floor.

No luck. Just another gray, lonely office furnished with dismantled filing cabinets and yellowing sheaves of printer paper. Sighing, Chloe shimmied her elbows forward and continued through the stifling darkness.

=========================================

Three days prior, Laplus had summoned Chloe to her quarters for an emergency debriefing. HoloX’s servers had recently suffered leaks of confidential data, and their leader had reason to believe the hack was coming from within the greater agency. The suspect’s name was Zeta– a relatively new recruit from the Indonesian offices wielding a disarmingly soft voice.

“Ehh? Zeta-chan?” Chloe was seated in front of Laplus’ executive desk and shuffling through the supposed evidence. “But she seemed like such a nice girl, are you sure it’s her?”

Laplus crossed her arms. “Of course I’m sure! Lui and I traced the attack back to her PC, she’s been doing this for days!”

“Maybe it was an accident? Zeta can be pretty clumsy, so it could-”

“We don’t have time to guess about that stuff,” Laplus interjected. “HoloX is in danger the longer she’s out there. Bring her in for questioning and we’ll know one way or another!”

=========================================

*So she says…it’s still hard to believe.* Lost in thought, Chloe banged her arm into a solid wall of sheet metal and squeaked out a yelp of surprise. Reaching a dead end meant she’d made it to the building’s opposite side, and that this was the final room to survey. Thin shafts of light, full of dancing dust particles, shone beneath her neck. Chloe shuffled backwards and peered through the grate.

*There!*

Twelve feet below and hunched over a layered spread of freshly-printed documents was Zeta. A nervous energy guided her hands over the mess of paper, like she was afraid that they’d run away without constant attention.

Chloe brought her face closer to the vent’s opening for a better view, sweat dripping off her chin and sizzling against the duct’s floor. The documents in question were as damning as she feared, proudly displaying her base’s location, plans for the future, and everything from blood type to the favorite foods of each member. A thorough archive of HoloX’s history.

Her target confirmed, Chloe pondered her next move. She knew from experience that having the drop on her opponent didn’t guarantee victory– she needed to wait until their guard was completely down. There was a couch on the east wall with a small cushion propped against the armrest and two light blankets collected at the other end. It was likely Zeta had been using this as her base of operations to dodge prying eyes, and it then stood to reason that she’d be sleeping soon enough. All Chloe had to do, uncomfortable though it may be, was wait.

=========================================

*Oh, this is so exciting!* Zeta smiled to herself as she continued fussing over her plan. HoloX’s anniversary was coming up soon and she couldn’t wait to show them the event she’d been working on! It was her own little way of giving thanks to her JP senpai for all their hard work and support. Sure, Zeta may have probed their mainframe two or three times, but she wanted to know everything about her seniors to better tailor the experience. She could apologize afterward and they’d share a laugh over the misunderstanding. Maybe some of the members would even compliment her impeccable hacking skills. 

She gathered her plans into a single thick stack of papers, tapped them twice on the desk until they fell into a solid block, and slid it carefully back inside the large manila envelope marked “Top Secret”. One part down, three to go. Yawning into her hand, Zeta pulled open a rickety drawer from below the desk and got ready for the second phase.

=========================================

Watching Zeta laboriously parse through the files was tortuous for Chloe. The orca had been baking in the vents the entire time, now completely slathered in an oily sheen of strong-smelling sweat that spanned from the top of her brow to the very bottom of her stuffy, sweltering boots. The shallowest breath was thick with the tainted air emanating from her greasy armpits, and the back of Chloe’s panties were drowning in butt sweat. Her body couldn’t physically bear spending another second stuffed up there, lest heatstroke bring the mission to an abrupt end, so she fiddled around for the small multitool on her hip and hastily unscrewed the grate she’d been spying through.

Zeta’s ears pricked up as a tiny metallic squeak sounded from above. Before she could turn around, a solid metal square clanged to the floor, followed closely by a descending humanoid blur of flapping red and black fabric.

“Eep!” Zeta clutched her hand to her chest, and watched the unknown assailant rise to its full height. The identity of her intruder slowly took shape. “C-Chloe? Is that you?”

A black mask with white marquis inlays around the eyes stared back at her. Zeta hadn’t seen that mask since debut, and facing it in person was unexpectedly intimidating. More pressingly, below the mask, Zeta noticed that her senpai was drenched in some sort of liquid. It coated Chloe’s skin like excessive tanning oil and raced down her chest and thighs in narrow streams. Her best guess was that Chloe had jumped into a pool before undressing, though the smell of chlorine would have been a godsend compared to the foul scent that was currently drifting off her senpai's skin. Zeta hesitantly sniffed the air, and confirmed her suspicions.

This smell that was slowly filling the room was unmistakably sweat! Salty, musky, and unnaturally pungent! The black leather of Chloe’s jacket did a good job of hiding the stains, but her camisole was completely dark gray, with yellowish stains peeking from around her armpits. And while the inside of Zeta’s hideout was plenty warm on its own, Chloe’s entire body was still *steaming* from the vast gulf of temperature between the surrounding stale air and the orca’s balmy, greasy skin.

While Zeta struggled to take in the scene, Chloe’s hand flashed to her belt and grabbed…nothing. There was supposed to be a compact plastic gun outfitted with tranquilizer rounds hanging off her hip, but Chloe was left grasping at an empty holster. Either it fell off on her journey through the vents or it was still sitting on her equipment table back at HoloX headquarters. 

*Ah, what to do now?* Moving the suspect off the premises would be too risky if she wasn’t properly sedated, but Chloe didn’t have a backup plan. Strangulation was an option, but could easily go wrong with too much force. There had to be something less lethal…

A small cough broke Chloe’s concentration. Zeta was looking off to the side and holding her nose, a look of pure disgust written on her face. “Not to be rude, but…is that smell coming from you, senpai?”

“Hm?” Chloe lifted her arm and gave it a quick check. Nothing out of the ordinary. Zeta, however, whimpered as Chloe’s armpit stank washed over her nose.

“Ugh, I thought all those clips about hating baths were a joke!” Zeta waved the air in front of her face and tried her best to remain respectful. “If you want to talk, can we please go outside first?”

Flustered, Chloe took a step back and furrowed her brow. “Hey, that’s-! It's not like skipping baths is that strange! Going a week…or three…without taking a shower doesn’t matter if you don’t sweat that much.”

Instead of pointing out the obvious, Zeta smiled weakly and moved the conversation along. “Um, sure, senpai. But really, I need to get some air, I’m getting light-headed just being next to you.”

*Light-headed..?* Chloe’s body relaxed as a solution to her missing tranquilizer gun presented itself. Without saying a word, she walked towards Zeta with renewed purpose, her expression unreadable behind the mask. The footfall of the assassin’s combat boots felt especially ominous for some reason.

“Hello? Wait, what’re you doing?” Zeta sensed something was off and began backing up, her eyes not so subtly measuring the distance to the exit door. In her haste, Zeta’s heel caught the foot of the desk and sent her sprawling to the ground on her back. “I-Is this a prank or something? You’re really scaring me!” The growing fear in Zeta’s voice choked the ending of her sentences, and her lips began to tremble. 

Chloe closed the final few feet and stood over Zeta’s body, one foot on each side of her ribcage. Drops of sweat fell off Chloe’s upper thighs and soaked into Zeta’s blouse. “We know what you’ve been up to, Zeta. I’m bringing you back in for questioning.”

“...the hacking thing?” Zeta sounded almost relieved. It was a bummer to have her plans found out but at least it wasn’t anything serious. “Well, you got me. Guess I still have to work on covering up my tracks.” Zeta giggled and started to get up, but was immediately knocked back to the ground as Chloe sat herself down on the agent’s chest, forcing a sharp puff of air from Zeta’s lungs.

“Hmph, so you admit it,” Chloe pouted. “Anyway, you were complaining about the smell, right? *My* smell?” With a bit of effort, Chloe reached down to yank off her right boot. There was a grotesque squelch when the footwear unstuck itself from the dank, swampy sole of Chloe’s stocking-clad foot, as though she had freed herself from an ankle-deep quagmire.

“I definitely smell good, you know? Here!” She inverted the boot in her hand and dangled the opening over Zeta’s face. The heavy funk of her stuffy footwear poured out from the yawning abyss of humid leather, quickly turning the air denser than an overcrowded sauna. “Ugh…then again, I…I’ve been wearing these all week, so they’re really ripe. And going barefoot those last dozen missions probably didn’t help. But that’s just a special case!” 

“Huh? ‘Ripe’? Senpai, w-what are-”

The boot slammed down over Zeta’s face with authority, its weathered rim encasing everything from the top of Zeta’s forehead down to the bottom of her chin, fully sealing her within a hot, humid tunnel of raw foot stank. The pungent, cheesy, well-aged aroma flooded across her lips and nostrils, granting unwanted intimacy with the thousands of steps Chloe had taken in them without ever properly airing them out. Rank droplets of sweat that had been collecting in the imprint of Chloe’s foot, soaked beneath her grimy sole for dozens upon dozens of hours, soon rolled down the length of the boot and trickled into Zeta’s unguarded orifices. 

“See? It’s like any other boot,” Chloe stated while pressing her footwear even deeper into Zeta’s face.

The secret agent thrashed and twisted her torso, screaming into her leather prison, but Chloe’s weight atop her chest was more than enough to lock her down. The smell was overbearing, and Zeta’s frantic breath started to pull the boot’s walls inward like she was hyperventilating into a paper bag. Those long, deep inhalations sucked the odor from the deepest parts of Chloe’s boot, all the way from the dark recesses where Chloe’s toes had rubbed against the inner walls.

Chloe remained motionless during the ordeal, aside from a light jostling whenever a fresh splatter of foot sweat found its way into Zeta’s mouth. The assassin’s hands kept the boot nice and snug, and the noisy pleas from her victim were easily muffled by the boot’s thick exterior, so it was little different from smothering someone out with a pillow. It was hard not to spare some sympathy, since Chloe herself had just gotten a whiff of the awful, stomach-churning stink marinating in there, but her line of work necessitated a certain level of sociopathy. Besides, it was only a matter of time until Zeta’s body gave in and she could get this mess over with.

Tragically, time alone would not be enough. Zeta was a veteran secret agent, a professional spy through and through, and she’d been trained to resist a variety of chemical weapons to avoid capture. Nerve agents, sleeping gas, even something as ubiquitous as chloroform could be shrugged off like laundry detergent, meaning Chloe had chosen a rather difficult egg to crack with olfactory warfare.

This unusual skillset did not go unnoticed. After ten minutes of screwing her reeking boot into Zeta’s face, Chloe called down to her. “Eh, you’re still going? I thought you'd pass out by now.” Chloe tilted her head to the side and considered her next action. “Hmm…so basically this isn’t enough?”

*Mmmrg! Mmmph!* Zeta rocked her head from side to side. There was a tinge of indignity in Chloe’s voice during that last line, as though her abilities as a member of HoloX were being questioned. Zeta had no interest in prodding her along that train of thought. She just needed the time to explain herself!

“Fine,” Chloe stated plainly. She pulled the boot off Zeta’s face with a *shllrk*, leaving a slimy circle around her visage where the foot sweat had congealed.

The orca then discarded her mask, revealing her brilliant crimson eyes, and shrugged her overcoat to the floor. Chloe’s bare arms and shoulders glistened in the open air. Another layer of musk seeped into the room, tanking the air quality even further and sending Zeta into another fit of retching. Chloe’s hands traveled to the crisscross of heavy black belts lining her torso, unbuckling them one at a time and tossing them aside. Each thud of the metal buckles hitting the carpet sent a shiver through Zeta’s bones.

With her light bondage removed, the full impact of Chloe's unkempt body was on display: the layered sweat stains darkening under her fat tits, the noticeable bumps where her nipples pushed out against her sheer top (the lack of bra was hardly a surprise given her bounciness), and, most concerningly, the slight pudge of her stomach pressing against the waistband of her plaid skirt. Zeta’s eyes zeroed in on that plump bit of flesh as a low grumble jostled Chloe’s tummy.

A great weight removed itself from Zeta’s chest as Chloe leaned back on her arms and raised her hips. After shifting her lower body forward a good foot or so, Chloe then planted her clammy, unwashed ass directly on Zeta’s face, smashing the agent’s lips against her asshole and burying her nose deep in the cleft of Chloe’s juicy pussy. Barely contained by Chloe’s undersized panties, the fat outer lips of her vulva spread nicely over Zeta’s nose and walled off any chance of fresh air. Chloe looked down with ire at her new seat.

“It smells great under there, right? I even started shaving, so it must be like a rose garden.” She started mashing her crotch into the agent’s face, the sodden material positively dripping with musk while Chloe’s pubic stubble tickled Zeta’s cheeks. “All the HoloX girls still insist on off collabing next to an open window, though, and they don't let me wear skirts in public anymore. So mean…”

Small tears formed in the corners of Zeta’s eyes as Chloe’s reeking, fishy musk drained into her sinuses. It was unbelievable that anyone, let alone an idol, could let themselves get this bad! Ancient layers of sweat and piss were still stuck to the damp, yellowed fabric and slowly seeped into Zeta’s nose like an aromatic candle. The oppressive acrid odor made Zeta wonder if Chloe even owned toilet paper, or if she had just been content to let her underwear soak up whatever dripped from between her plump folds after an idol meeting.

Still, the worst was yet to come.

The assassin groaned and shifted in her seat as a small burp traveled up her throat. For all her deplorable hygiene and slobbiness, Chloe’s true affront to those around her was undoubtedly her rancid, room-clearing farts. She seemed to be brimming with them at all times, either from a poor diet or an unfortunate twist of genetics, and even she had to admit how absolutely disgusting they could be. She was smart enough not to let anything out in the vents (aside from a few small ones that slipped out during especially strenuous movements), so there was plenty building up. The original plan, as with all field work, was to wait until she got back home and let HoloX’s poor toilet take the brunt of it, but it looked like her relief was much closer at hand this time around.

Chloe started walking her feet forward until the edges of her tall, dark red heels were the only parts of her body touching the ground. The rest of Chloe’s weight was balanced on Zeta’s face, bearing down with so much force that Zeta could feel the wrinkles of Chloe’s unwashed anus pressing on her pursed lips. The labored exertions coming from above made it clear what Chloe’s next move was, though Zeta had no recourse but to shut her eyes tight and hope that this was an empty threat.

“Everyone’s always making fun of me for not bathing,” Chloe said amidst the rumbling of her stomach, “and every stream is full of people *mmn* calling me a stinky orca! Well, if you’re all so obsessed with how I smell, then take a good whiff of *this*!”

Chloe didn’t even need to push; she simply relaxed her asshole and let eight hours of backed-up gas erupt across Zeta’s face in a loud, sloppy cacophony. Chloe's eyes drifted to the ceiling in relief while her grimy asshole vibrated against Zeta’s lips, mixing spittle with ass sweat as her fiercely warm fart bubbled noisily across Zeta’s shut mouth. The rancid gas poured down the agent’s chin, past her cheeks, and up the bridge of her nose before finally escaping from beneath the weight of Chloe’s fat cheeks and spilling into the stale office air.  It went on for almost eight unbroken seconds, loud enough to bounce off all four walls and undercut by an unpleasant wetness from the intense sweating of her ass crack. By the end, the entirety of Zeta’s face was *blanketed* in the choking, muggy warmth of Chloe’s rippling fart, settling heavily on her neckline like someone had draped her with a heated bath towel.

“*Ahhh…*” Content, Chloe unclenched her toes and let Zeta breathe in the fallout.

While the majority of the assassin’s gaseous load blew harmlessly across Zeta’s face, the scant streams that did end up funneling down Chloe’s taint, between her pussy lips, and up Zeta’s nostrils were so unbelievably putrid that she felt her brain white out and melt into a fuzzy paste. Trying to process the odor raping her sinuses was impossible; the combined aroma of weeks-old sweat, sulfur, and feminine musk created a high-yield grenade of stench that seared her nasal cavity to the point of numbness. Zeta kicked her legs across the carpet, banging her knee into the nearby desk as she struggled to get the tormentor off her face. The tears from her eyes grew larger and fuller, rolling down her cheeks only to dampen the inner walls of Chloe’s thighs. 

Chloe cupped her left butt cheek and lifted it slightly, relishing the sensation of another hot fart sputtering out. The bottom of her butt and thighs felt unnervingly warm now, but most of the smell had been snorted up or simply settled down around Zeta’s head. Annoyingly, there was still a small pocket of gas trapped within her crack, swirling just below her asshole and right above Zeta’s lips. The sensation was quite itchy, so Chloe made use of Zeta’s facial features to grind and rub against as an improvised scratching tool.

Midway through this process, a chirpy jingle rang out from Chloe’s pocket. The noise was almost drowned out by Zeta’s muffled whimpering, but, with a quick flick of the wrist, Chloe whipped out her cell phone and brought it to her ear. “Hello?”

“You’re three hours late,“ Laplus admonished. “Lui’s been waiting outside the gate since sundown, what’s taking so long?”

The assassin sighed and casually scratched under her armpit. “S-sorry, I wanted to wait for the right time and the target kept…hold on…” Chloe grunted and pushed out a particularly nasty fart, the kind that would definitely leave a permanent stain on both the back of her panties and whatever chair she was using. “*Whew*…sorry, like I was saying, the target kept delaying me. I don’t have a weapon on me, but I still found a way to *nngh* knock her out.” Her final words were interspersed with short, bubbly farts breaking against Zeta’s face that were loud enough to make Laplus flinch away from the phone.

“Oh, yes, I see.” Despite being miles away, Laplus had instinctively covered her face with her oversized sleeve during the conversation. She’d known Chloe long enough to understand how repulsive her gas was, though she’d never experienced it firsthand. “As long as you get the job done. I’ll have Lui on standby, call in when you need her.”

Laplus ended the call and sat back down in her plushy executive chair. For some reason her tiny hands were trembling in her lap– simply imagining what Zeta had to have been going through on the other end of the line disturbed her greatly. Spy or not, surely she didn’t deserve that kind of treatment.

Chloe shoved the phone back into her pocket and regarded Zeta’s shimmering blue eyes that peeked out from between her thighs. Beneath a veneer of tears, those eyes were full of pain, humiliation, and disgust. Understandably so. “Still not enough?”

Zeta didn’t have the luxury to reply in full. Her only options were to continue squirming and mumbling beneath Chloe’s rear.

Leaning back on her hands, Chloe unstuck herself from Zeta’s sweat-slick face once more, and walked her hips a couple of inches forward. The secret agent below had little over a second to watch her oppressor’s meaty ass suspend itself above her, two globes of flesh dripping in sweat and hammocked by a pair of heavily discolored panties, before it *plapped* back down and completely smothered her face. The stains from Chloe’s earlier farts painted a light brown smudge along her crack, especially dense near her asshole, which found its mark perfectly on top of Zeta’s nose.

Merely making contact with Chloe’s sweaty, unwiped shithole set Zeta’s twitching nostrils on fire. The baked-in dregs of Chloe’s anal eruptions stung like vaporized vinegar, and Zeta could hardly fathom the stench a raw blast from this range would produce. She felt like a prisoner being dragged into the shadow of the town gallows. That overwhelming fear grabbed hold of her, pulling every muscle of her body taut with adrenaline to fight her fate as she began shoving and pushing and beating against Chloe’s thighs.  

At the same time, Zeta’s mouth had been relieved of its duties of kissing Chloe’s asshole and was only somewhat smothered by the orca’s cheeks, giving her an avenue for one final appeal. “Senpai, *wait*! Please wait! I wasn’t doing anything bad, I just wanted to know more about you guys for this project I was put-”

Unfortunately, Chloe had no interest in hearing her out. There was no more time for negotiations. The assassin leaned back on her hips and adjusted her legs into a deep spread squat, brazenly flashing her panties to the outside world. She set her hands atop her knees and wiggled her butt until she felt Zeta’s nose dig as deep as it could go in her musky crack. This was her full weight, smashing her target’s nose into an upturned pig snout and creating a straight shot from Chloe’s bowels into Zeta’s nasal canal. If her bedsheets and seat cushions were anything to go by, Zeta would be scrubbing the smell of Chloe’s ass from her nostrils for days…if not weeks.

Chloe’s stomach grumbled, louder and angrier. The cramping sensation seemed to twist her guts into knots several times over. Chloe’s hands gripped her knees tight, lightly fraying the pantyhose, and she felt her kouhai’s nostrils twitch against her greasy anal folds. This one would require actual effort from her side; the deepest, rankest farts she’d been brewing always needed a good amount of straining to push out. With a terse exhale and sweat streaming down her thighs, Chloe flexed her core.

A bassy, rumbling foghorn sounded from beneath Chloe’s skirt as her sweaty, gaping asshole sprayed lungfuls of foul gas down Zeta’s nose and fumigated the entirety of her nasal cavity in the blink of an eye. Stray streams of warm wind splashed off Zeta’s nose plug and flapped the pleated strands of Chloe’s skirt like a lazy summer breeze. Zeta’s face was an excellent damper, letting the deep tone of Chloe’s release reverberate through her skull and into the floor.

There was hardly any time to mentally prepare, not that any organism with a functioning sense of smell could ever brace for the sheer brutality of snorting Chloe’s rancid ass fumes. Zeta felt Chloe’s horrible wet farts fill out her nostrils and clog the back of her throat like a semi-liquid plug, an odorous miasma brimming with the worst scents imaginable that only grew in potency the longer she imbibed its flavor. It was so vile, so repulsive that Zeta’s esophagus locked up and cut off her breath mid-gasp, forcing Chloe’s waste to billow into her mouth, surge across her tongue, and soak into her thousands of waiting taste buds. Every time Chloe tensed her stomach and flooded Zeta’s nose, the smell was refreshed and multiplied across her senses.

Zeta broke. She was trained to never give in to pain, to hold on to survival no matter the cost, but being used as Chloe’s fart filter made her want to chew through cyanide pills like candy. She gargled and flailed in agony, failing to move Chloe’s fat ass even a centimeter off her face.

Chloe paid her little mind. She was much more absorbed in the pleasant warmth spreading out from beneath her sweaty, vibrating cheeks as her internal discomfort slowly drained and sputtered away. Her face lit up in a small smile that was assuredly adorable out of context, occasionally dipping into a concentrated frown when she had to push out another sloppy load. Five more uninterrupted seconds of ripping ass on her target's face followed before her tank was finally (mostly) empty, and Chloe let out a huge moan of relief.

Though miraculously conscious, there was no way for Zeta’s body to process the aftermath of Chloe’s release. Nothing entered her headspace beyond the odorous hellscape baking her senses and the chest-tightening sensation of slowly approaching suffocation; her mind was well and truly fried. Still choking and gagging on mouthfuls of spit and ass sweat, her teary eyes rolled back while the final traces of Chloe’s wet farts sizzled across her tongue like carbonated water. 

Chloe felt her chair go still. The pathetic whimpering grew silent. “Eh? Zeta-chan? Hello?” She touched her target’s wrist and felt a rhythmic pulse, but no other movement.

Just to be safe, Chloe flexed her glutes and started to wipe her ass with Zeta’s face. This was both to ensure her target was out cold but also to take care of the stubborn itchiness that returned to her crack in the wake of passing so much gas.

Three minutes later, her job was done.

With a huff, Chloe rocked forward and peeled herself off Zeta's face, her butt feeling strangely cool without her kouhai’s warm breath panting against it. A good amount of Zeta’s saliva still coated the back of Chloe’s panties and dripped down to the agent’s unblinking, sweat-slathered face. Straightening her skirt, Chloe phoned up her getaway.

“Lui? Mhmm, I just finished. Coming out now.”

Hopefully Zeta would be quick to confess the details of her crime, Chloe mused. She wasn’t even their appointed interrogator, after all, and HoloX had much more deranged methods of getting information.
