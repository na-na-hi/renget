>It's my first Christmas in America
>Similar to what I'm used to in Japan
>But different
>For one thing, people aren't flocking to KFC
>Still, I enjoy it
>I have a very special present for my boyfriend
>It's a surprise
>"Merry Christmas, honey!"
>I see his eyes go wide
>He didn't know I'd bought this outfit
>"Wow... you look amazing!"
>My smile widens
>Nice to know I can still surprise him
>In a good way
>What he doesn't know is that I'm not actually wearing anything underneath this
>The bra straps are decoys
>As the day winds down, I relax in front of the fireplace
>"Well, aren't you going to open your last present?"
>He catches on immediately
>Removes my hat, boots and gloves
>Then removes my dress
>Pleasantly surprised to see I'm utterly nude
>"I thought you deserved a Christmas treat for being such a good boyfriend"
>We make love right there
>The romantic fire beside us helps set the mood
>There's something I really wish I could give him
>Something I can make almost all by myself, with only a little something from him
>But the time's not right
>Maybe in a few years
>Of course, I'll have to start making it in March...
