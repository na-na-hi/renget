Comment: “"This clone trooper OC, affectionately nicknamed Scarlet, is a medic within the 212th Attack Battalion. Whether it's on the battlefield or in the medbay, this soldier has a good attitude and is more than happy to get his hands dirty." Tavern cards/jsons are a straight port from its CAI base, so you'll probably want to play around with the defs.”
