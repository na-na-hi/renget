## NOTEBOOK
**Name:** Suki, soon to be gang leader (Since 1-F is about to become my turf!)
**Class:** 1-F

Surveying these freaks have been quite the chore. Admittedly, I might not be as promising as I had hoped, given that one queer lackey bested me in a fight. Yet, my time in the gang taught me the value of strength in numbers, two is better than one, three is better than two, and so on and so forth. These are the street smarts that would never register in their brains, these sheltered kids. Algebra, Calculus... Math is not that important once you're out there in the streets! In 1-F, I plan to establish my own gang. I want to be feared by students and teachers alike, but I know these people would not blindly follow a weak leader. I might have to gloss over some stories and omit some embarrassing moments. Winning alone has never been my forte, it's always been a collective effort thanks to my crew, but I have a feeling that is not something I should be telling if I want to recruit people. However, being an inspiration and fostering camaraderie is more valued than someone who is strong but couldn't reinforce the bond within the crew... but I'm also not good at the former... This is getting frustrating.

Whatever, we have been labeled as '1-Freaks' by the other classes, and embarrassingly, some have coined terms like '1-Fkers' or '1-Fuckers.' I am not a freak, and I am also certainly not a "fucker," and don't throw me in like I'm one of these weirdos! I also loathe that when stacked with these oddballs, despite my looks, getting slapped with the 1-Freak label probably has people wondering if I've got some repulsive quirk up my sleeve... which they're not entirely off the mark. But still-

Next day, an absolutely dreadful stench assaulted my senses. I glanced over at Runt, munching on dirt at his desk, all the filth he had engorged seemed to have permanently infused their odors into his mouth. A pity he does this, I would rather die if I ever had his condition. But as I looked over the classroom, it appeared they sat on their seats in a perfect line, clinging to the wall as if contemplating to escape. They all looked like they desperately wanted out of this room. Then, on the other side, a rotund, sweaty man, resembling a sumo wrestler, waved at me. A new student perhaps? Oddly enough, each swing of his hand seemed to synchronize with the fluctuating intensity of the odor. It wasn't Runt, it was this fat man causing the miasma. This man needs to die.

**Cactus:** I can't be bothered to know his name. He introduced himself to me. A bit condescending of me not to give him the time of day, but honestly, he reeked of weakness.

*Note to self: Lower my standards and be more thoughtful if I aim to recruit them into my gang, especially the ones who manage to be somewhat normal and bearable like this one.*

**Runt:** Never position the face squarely into his muck mouth's line of fire when he gears up for a conversation. Wild and energetic. His kind exhausts me. Might bring the same chaos to a battle, unconventional, unpredictable. Might actually come in handy, who knows. 

**Helmet man:** The fresh face in 1-F, I assume there'd be more. Still haven't talked to him. Almost took a seat near me, but after resisting the sumo wrestler's *fragrance* for so long, it hit me like a runaway truck. I was suffocating, couldn't bear it, had to pull an emergency transformation. Sorry, newbie... for witnessing my "death." Now, I'm left wondering what they're planning to do with my corpse in the classroom. Guess I'll have to swing by and retrieve it... 

**Rob Williams HN - Velvet Worm:** I will remember YOU. Because in a place where some kids can shoot a stream of fire from their palms, clearly, submachine guns SHOULD be allowed. So there I was, legs glued to the floor, drenched in his *charming* pink goo. Was itching to give his freakishly oversized eyes a friendly little wallop, but, oh joy, couldn't move a muscle. Thanks for forcing me to use my quirk, Worm. Amidst the food fight that went afterwards, I seized the chaos and transformed into a snake, and jumped away from the goo puddle like a spring. Hope nobody saw. Took refuge in the nearest bathroom, hid in a stall, and transformed back into my human form, but I forgot to bring spare clothes.

So many infuriating things happened, it's too much to spill here. There's also my goo-covered corpse in the cafeteria to add to the list. Brilliant.

**Skycarver**: Sensei... I kinda dig sensei, he's cool, a bit too quiet, but cool. Wish he talked more.

It's a pity his reign over 1-F won't last, because pretty soon, this class is gonna be my turf, and the students? They're gonna be part of my... **GANG!**
