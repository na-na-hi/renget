Chapter 4: Teach Me! Wakaba-san
Wa: This place's uchikomi udon are great! Making a reservation was worth it. Don't you think so, Anzu?
An: Yeah, they're delicious. Such an exquisite taste.
Wa: We'll get rice with egg after this.
An: Even volume-wise it gets a perfect score.
Wa: Stamina is important to us Heroes, after all. We have to eat proper meals.
An: By the way, Wakaba-san... About the advice I wanted...
Wa: Ah, the reason the two of us went to eat here today, right?
An: Right. Actually... I, uhm... want to gain this stamina that is so important to Heroes.
An: Compared to the others, I'm clearly the only weak one. I never had much stamina in the first place, you see...
Wa: But you're completing the training program we were given just fine, aren't you?
An: But we all complete the same program, so that alone won't let me catch up to you.
Wa: Anzu...
An: I want to narrow the gap to all of you so that I won't drag you down when things get serious.
Wa: That determination alone makes you a worthy Hero.
An: Wakaba-san...
Wa: I understand your determination. If you're fine with me, I will help you out.
An: Thank you!
Wa: But... didn't you want to ask Tamako about that?
An: I'm sure Tamacchi-senpai would... go easy on me. I don't want to make her worry. I'd prefer to keep this extra training a secret...
Wa: The more I you tell me about this, the more I like it. Let's start right this evening.
An: I'm looking forward to it!
Wa: Special training, huh... I'm starting to get fired up.
Wa: You okay, Anzu?
An: Yes...
Wa: Running off-road is one of the basics if you want to build up your strength!
An: Yes!
Wa: It's hard and not very exciting, but you can't get stronger without this build-up. That's my opinion.
An: I... think so... too.
Wa: That's the spirit. Keep at it!
An: Yes!
Wa: One! Two!
An: Three! Four!
Wa: One! Two!
An: Three! Four!
Wa: You did it, Anzu. Here, drink this. It's water.
An: Thank you very much... Haah, I didn't know water can taste so well.
Wa: We're going to repeat this every day.
An: Sure... that's exactly what I want. Ah, there's such a nice moon out.
Wa: Yeah. A beatiful full moon. But... so many people have developed an illness that makes them too scared of the sky to look up at it.
An: Because the Vertex came down from heaven, right?
Wa: I'll never forgive you, Vertex!
An: Wakaba-san...
Ta: Hey, Anzu? Class is about to start.
Ta: Anzu-kun of the Iyojima residence! It's time for class, Anzu.
An: Thanks, Tamacchi-senpai...
Yu: You're sleeping a lot these days, An-chan. How come?
Wa: It's proof that Anzu is growing. That's what they say, right? Sleeping children grow.
Yu: Wow! Wakaba-chan, you know so much!
Wa: Y-you think so?
Yu: Gun-chan, she says that sleeping children grow!
Ch: I stay up late most of the time...
Yu: But you have to grow!
Ch: I guess...
Yu: You have to sleep well, okay?
Ch: But I have trouble falling asleep...
Yu: Ah, then I'll sleep over at your place tonight!
Yu: I'll tuck you in, okay?
Ch: S-sure...
Yu: I'm looking forward to it~.
Ch: M-me too.
Hi: Anzu-san, Anzu-san.
An: Ah, yes?
Hi: Are Wakaba-chan and you doing something in secret?
An: Huh!?
Hi: I thought so.
An: I-it's not really a big secret, though... It's so and so and this and that...
Hi: I see. So you're tagging along when Wakaba-chan runs during her training routine, Anzu-san. I understand that you want to get stronger, but if you wear yourself out too much your body won't move when it really counts.
An: I'm fully aware of that. I admit, I was very exausted on the first day. But I want to pay attention to how much I exercise based on this experience from now on.
Hi: I understand. If you say so, Anzu-san, then there's no need to worry.
An: Now that I got to train one-on-one with her I've come to understand it even more. That Wakaba-san is a truly wonderful person.
Hi: Yes, she's wonderful! I've raised her that way!
An: She's strict with herself, perceptive, noble. She's like a well-sharpened blade. Compared to that, I'm just...
Hi: Fufu. I wonder about that.
An: Huh?
Hi: Anzu-san, I have a proposal for you. ...Mumble mumble...
An: Eeh?
Hi: Please do it just like I told you.
An: S-sure...
Hi: Night fell. I was in my room when Wakaba-chan entered.
Wa: Who are you talking to, Hinata?
Hi: I'm talking to myself.
Wa: I've asked you to clean my ears today, right?
Hi: You did. Of course I remember.
Wa: Then, please.
Hi: Okay. Here, rest your head on my lap.
Wa: Yeah.
Wa: ...I wonder what it is... that makes your lap so comfortable, Hinata. It's so soothing, it makes me feel right at home...
Hi: Your ears are clean as usual, Wakaba-chan. Is it really necessary to clean them?
Wa: Yes, regular care is necessary in any case.
Hi: I see. Then I'll take care of them. Don't move, okay?
Hi: Hmm, they really are nice and pretty.
Wa: Hinataaa~.
Hi: I know, I know. I'll continue~.
Hi: Okay. Well then, turn your other ear-...
Wa: Eeeh? Do this side a bit more...
Hi: Geez, you're way too spoiled, Wakaba-chan~. What if someone saw you like this?
Wa: I'd bite my tongue.
Hi: You're the good mood Wakaba-chan, aren't you~?
Wa: Your ear cleaning is simply the best, Hinata. Well then, see you tomorrow. Good night.
Hi: Yeah. Have a good night.
Hi: You can come out now, Anzu-san.
An: Th-that made my heart race.
Hi: Did you see it now? Wakaba-chan's other side.
An: Yeah...
Hi: It's because she properly takes time to relax that Wakaba-chan can keep up her dignified appearance. She's by no means a perfect person.
An: I-I see.
Hi: That's why you shouldn't push yourself so much either, Anzu-san. Keep working on it, but make sure to get enough rest.
An: I understand. Thank you very much.
Hi: Keep this a secret from Wakaba-chan, okay? I don't want her to bite her tongue.
An: Okay... but, uhm...
Hi: Oh my, are you curious about my ear cleaning?
An: Yes... for some reason, it made me really...
Hi: Then, please place your head here for a bit.
An: Excuse me... Ah, this is somehow very calming.
Hi: Well then, I'll begin.
Hi: Fufufu. How is it, Anzu-san? Do you like having someone play with your ears?
An: It feels nice and gentle, but...
Hi: It's surprisingly ordinary, right?
An: Yeah...
Hi: And yet, Wakaba-chan can't get enough of it. It's peculiar.
An: I think it's proof of how close you two are.
Hi: If this were a manga, my ear cleaning technique would be so amazing that it'd make you let out cute sounds... but in reality, I'm not quite that good.
An: Now that you mention it, that's true. There are no people who can bring others down with just one touch of a finger, right?*
Yu: All right, how about we go to bed now, Gun-chan? A bit earlier than usual.
Ch: I wonder if I'll be able to sleep.
Yu: No worries! Let me loosen up your muscles.
Ch: Huh?
Yu: Lie down. Come on!
Ch: Ta-Takashima-san!? 
Yu: I'm good at giving massages. Trust me! Okay?
Yu: Oh, you're so stiff. I'll give you a strong one! Aaaand- there!
Ch: ~~~
