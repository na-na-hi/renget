#Axia Voting Record
***
*Your Royal Apostolic Majesty,*

*We have found it most wise and prudent to publish the results of our voting to the rest of the world on certain matters of importance to them. Diplomatically, we in the Senate believe that this will make people less uneasy about our nation, and will bring us closer to our goals of spreading the Gospel of Truth. We thus ask graciously for your approval.*

*Humbly,*

*Senatus Dominus*

*To the noble Senate,*

*We believe that this proposal is most wise, and with great merit. So long as it is properly censored and the results are worthy of public display, we approve of this idea. We will personally review those which shall be published ourselves.*

*Faithfully as the Servant of my Wife,*

*His Royal Apostolic Majesty,
King Athanasius II of Axia*

##28th of January, 2023

The Kingdom of Axia would like to cast its ballot on the following measures:

1. The placement of /jidf/ (>>41500127 for reasons)

Aye. 

We support the Jews joining us. Welcome.

2. The placement of /wvt/ (>>41695574 for reasons)

Abstain. 

We do not understand enough about this placement overall to comment. Our only concern, which is why we shall abstain, is that we do not think this in particular has been discussed enough and the fact their placement is more on historical means than for writing also leads us to this conclusion.

More discussion is needed on this, in our overall view.

3. The placement of /pkg/ (>>41695574 for reasons)

Aye. 

Unlike /wvt/, We think the case for /pkg/ is stronger because they have interest in those wanting to write for them, and we think that is a good reason. Furthermore, while perhaps not discussed enough, we think it does set a good precedent overall considering all of the paranoia shown that has negatively affected many of posters and has in our belief caused many posters to show paranoia towards us, which brings us grief.

4. VOTING REFORM! https://rentry.org/39iwaf

Abstain. 

We feel like many of the concerns are likely overblown results of mutual paranoia that this thread has shown a lot, that there is a lack of refinement to this, and that many anons haven't really voiced their opinions on it. We believe all major changes like this should have a good period of discussion before being agreed upon given that not everyone can participate. 

As for the proposal itself, we personally like it however and approve but our vote here should concern the thread as a whole and not our own personal feelings.
