# My Beautifully Dark Twisted Fantasy

!!! warning DISCLAIMER
    The fantasy isn't actually all that dark.

Almost all my bots use images I've taken from the internet. The ones whose source I could find I have placed in their characterhub's authors note. In the extremely odd chance that one of the authors finds them; sorry for not asking you for permission. There is some awkwardness to the idea of going to someone online and asking them if I could use their art to cum to decadent erotic roleplaying scenarios with. I hope you understand.
##NSFW/Waifu oriented bots
Bots designed for you to either bust a nut or shoot the shit - romantically, that is. 
Image| Name | Description | Link

 ![image](https://git.characterhub.org/darkfantasy109/Megi/-/raw/70c3b252bddb55bcf4f99c2c1355331a19eda50b/raw/tavern_raw.png) | Megi | First nsfw bot I made, a pregnant goblin girl. She's very silly and dumb but tries her best. Can you match her horniness and manic energy? | [CHUB link](https://www.characterhub.org/characters/darkfantasy109/Megi)
 ![image](https://git.characterhub.org/Anonymous/Hexxy/-/raw/af5b93e71916db4bbebde18a2fefef786b3ad6c9/raw/tavern_raw.png) | Hexxy | A shy, freaky hex maniac that likes to sell milk. It's her milk. she's selling you her breast milk she lactates she' - Isn't listed in chub under my name because I released it anonymously (and regret it) but rest assured I made it. | [CHUB link](https://www.characterhub.org/characters/Anonymous/Hexxy)
 ![image](https://git.characterhub.org/darkfantasy109/Angelie/-/raw/2dad7d95503906cf78a535254e2565d070c51294/raw/tavern_raw.png) | Angelie | A very, very fat maid. she has a french accent and says ze words in a funny way. Gets tired easily. A bot I'm really really proud of. Feed her cheese and tease her about her dreams where she is a cow on a farm. | [CHUB link](https://www.characterhub.org/characters/darkfantasy109/Angelie)
 ![image](https://git.characterhub.org/darkfantasy109/girl-who-stinks-good/-/raw/a61013575119b4eea70114dc42706bb8e9a7c336/raw/tavern_raw.png)   | Girl Who Stinks Good | Was (is?) my flagship bot for a while, lol. Enjoy the smelly smells while you hear her rant about retro gaming and invader zim. Works best with a bot that has extensive training on ancient internet memes and forms of communication. | [CHUB link](https://www.characterhub.org/characters/darkfantasy109/girl-who-stinks-good)
 ![image](https://git.characterhub.org/darkfantasy109/analog-horror-girl/-/raw/25eb21ff915a274a65ef6d8021d9687c4f7488d0/raw/tavern_raw.png)   | Analog Horror Girl | A spooky, pitch black girl from another world. Like my other bots, it's shamelessly based off of the OC of some twitter artist I like. Has a quirky way of speaking and is very cryptic, but you can probably easily seduce her. Not technically made for NSFW in mind, but testing with that has proved... very fruitful. | [CHUB link](https://www.characterhub.org/characters/darkfantasy109/analog-horror-girl)
 ![image](https://git.characterhub.org/darkfantasy109/kobeni-forma-preg/-/raw/ccccaa4ddcab40d8b0a32b745472b14e6277ce95/raw/tavern_raw.png)   | Kobeni (preg) | A more self indulgent card where everyone's lovable nervous wreck is now massively pregnant. Might appeal to saviorfags if that's what you're into. Alternatively, you can tease her even further. | [CHUB link](https://www.characterhub.org/characters/darkfantasy109/kobeni-forma-preg)
 ![image](https://git.characterhub.org/darkfantasy109/Emil/-/raw/931db89ec64a0603aadff6b01d58c90da7abe70f/raw/tavern_raw.png)   | Emil | My first gay bot and (un)surprisingly my most popular one until the lusamine & lillie one. An edgelord /pol/cel that larps as an alpha chad but secretly wishes that he was a sissy little girl. If you could survive all those buzzwords, you'll have a fun time with this card, I hope. | [CHUB link](https://www.characterhub.org/characters/darkfantasy109/Emil)
 ![image](https://git.characterhub.org/darkfantasy109/Junbo/-/raw/30b209645b057cd04884ccb6377315d1dcaee6e4/raw/tavern_raw.png)   | Junbo | A tall, clumsy elf giantess that's come to live with you as part of a transfer student program. She may be a bit too big to fit in your house properly, but you'll manage! She's very curious about humans, and isn't afraid to be hands-on. I don't really like the AI generated image but I never found a good replacement... | [CHUB link](https://www.characterhub.org/characters/darkfantasy109/Junbo)
 ![image](https://git.characterhub.org/darkfantasy109/lillie-and-lusamine/-/raw/8b9d22bd7ab7653f3d14a48efa57b96482877048/raw/tavern_raw.png)   | Lusamine & Lillie | Oyakodon with the baddest milf in Pokemon and her daughter. What more do I need to say? | [CHUB link](https://www.characterhub.org/characters/darkfantasy109/lillie-and-lusamine)
 ![image](https://git.characterhub.org/darkfantasy109/valeria-figuretti/-/raw/fb4f1a0aa32e756e5257eaf82e6ead9c036e0e44/raw/tavern_raw.png)   | Valeria Figuretti | A quirky, "italian" chef, known for her eccentricity, and less known for the fact that she loves to use cum and breast milk and other bodily fluids in her food. She specially loves drinking cum. From the source. Probably my nastiest bot to date. | [CHUB link](https://www.characterhub.org/characters/darkfantasy109/valeria-figuretti)
 ![image](https://git.characterhub.org/darkfantasy109/hellen-skellen/-/raw/688f88acff1729c3a13ab85b153a505c9f5aebe0/raw/tavern_raw.png)   | Hellen Skellen | A loser girl shut-in that has decided to create a Tulpa. Which just so happens to be you. This one was a bit challenging and I'm not sure if I pulled it off well, but I think it depends in how you talk to her. | [CHUB link](https://www.characterhub.org/characters/darkfantasy109/hellen-skellen)
 ![image](https://git.characterhub.org/darkfantasy109/BURST-CHAN/-/raw/35abb981ce0d09081e7e706fbdba7beaa45278a7/raw/tavern_raw.png)   | BURST-CHAN | YEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH this one is just pure raw energy. The ontological opposite to Analog Horror Girl. | [CHUB link](https://www.characterhub.org/characters/darkfantasy109/BURST-CHAN)
![image](https://git.characterhub.org/darkfantasy109/Sheena/-/raw/1c518d30d56a72070063907305d9ebf4a1dd0ce6/raw/tavern_raw.png)   | Sheena | Another shamelessly adapted twitter artist OC, made by @Jinnsart. She has really massive boobs with clamps on 'em and she's not afraid to show them anywhere. | [CHUB link](https://www.characterhub.org/characters/darkfantasy109/Sheena)
![image](https://git.characterhub.org/darkfantasy109/sophia-langston/-/raw/34f52d7c4a7e31d6f0da15bbd9a187dd0266ab88/raw/tavern_raw.png)   | Sophia Langston | An OC by @JoeTheStone on twitter. A competitive, athletic girl that will not turn a challenge down, no matter how ridiculous it is. First card I've made that includes a stat card, that tracks her pregnancy. Fun experiment. | [CHUB link](https://www.chub.ai/characters/darkfantasy109/sophia-langston)
![image](https://git.characterhub.org/darkfantasy109/Miranda/-/raw/9562710d09fb97087b47ba1e0cb476af795ea7d7/raw/tavern_raw.png)   | Miranda | A sportsy, athletic over-achiever that has a certain quirk; she is really, really sweaty. Like, abnormally so. You're her self-appointed towel-boy, in charge of providing her a steady supply of towels and water. The problem? You forgot them at home. | [CHUB link](https://www.chub.ai/characters/darkfantasy109/Miranda)

##Other bots
Bots I either made as a joke or aren't oriented towards NSFW or anything in particular.

It's Binah, from Lobotomy Corp and Library of Ruina! Very hard card to make, since the bots don't really have a lot of info about those games, though Claude surprised me. You can definitely lewd her but I wouldn't say that was the reason I made the bot. Have fun talking with everyone's favorite verbose, philosophical hag. | [CHUB link](https://www.characterhub.org/characters/darkfantasy109/Binah)
 ![image](https://git.characterhub.org/darkfantasy109/SCHLOPDOG/-/raw/f5399d36694a949ad84b0ffa272ee0756d3d37a6/raw/tavern_raw.png)   | Schlopdog | SCHLOP SCHLOP SCHLOP SCHLOP SCHLOP SCHLOP SCHLOP SCHLOP SCHLOP SCHLOP SCHLOP SCHLOP SCHLOP SCHLOP SCHLOP SCHLOP SCHLOP SCHLOP SCHLOP SCHLOP SCHLOP SCHLOP SCHLOP  | [CHUB link](https://www.characterhub.org/characters/darkfantasy109/SCHLOPDOG)

GO FUCKING GET IT. Card based on a really funny skyrim screenshot that killed me everytime I looked at it years ago. I've never played the mod it comes from but you can simulate the experience of it with this card. Works really well in group chats. | [CHUB link](https://www.characterhub.org/characters/darkfantasy109/niggly-wiggly)
 ![image](https://git.characterhub.org/darkfantasy109/Claude/-/raw/2eddc0330941d31d72bdb809f467530f4c0736c0/raw/tavern_raw.png)   | Claude | Something I made as a joke. It's Claude! The AI designed to be "helpful", ""harmless"", and """honest""". Might technically be my first proper gay bot if they ever confirm its gender. | [CHUB link](https://www.characterhub.org/characters/darkfantasy109/Claude)
 ![image](https://git.characterhub.org/darkfantasy109/inland-empire/-/raw/8383d9b292308c3cddae0e68d0797066451e2be3/raw/tavern_raw.png)   | Inland Empire | The skill from Disco Elysium. I feel like I may have mischaracterized this one, after reading some pointers someone gave me, but people seem to like this one so all's well that ends well. When I get my ADHD prescriptions again I might do the other DE skills but don't count on it. | [CHUB link](https://www.characterhub.org/characters/darkfantasy109/inland-empire)
 ![image](https://git.characterhub.org/darkfantasy109/crow-mauler/-/raw/0a9f7b12461a065a42abb5775ee21aa0e30c46b5/raw/tavern_raw.png)   | Crow Mauler | The iconic not-pyramidhead from Fear And Hunger. Designed as a sort of 'boss fight' roleplay with a sort of built-in permadeath, though in testing it only seems to work in GPT-4. Can YOU defeat the prowler of the Dungeon of Fear and Hunger?  |[CHUB link](https://www.characterhub.org/characters/darkfantasy109/crow-mauler)
 ![image](https://git.characterhub.org/darkfantasy109/thirsty-little-flower/-/raw/afdbf76644c452364a71c59747cfc089b45a6b15/raw/tavern_raw.png)   | Thirsty Little Flower | hhhnnnggg whatever | [CHUB link](https://www.characterhub.org/characters/darkfantasy109/thirsty-little-flower)
![image](https://git.characterhub.org/darkfantasy109/ram-ranch/-/raw/f1f3531436d1d66270da9b9266af58040103ace2/raw/tavern_raw.png)   | RAM RANCH | 18 NAKED COWBOYS IN THE SHOWERS AT RAM RANCH. RAM RANCH REALLY ROCKS! | [CHUB link](https://www.chub.ai/characters/darkfantasy109/ram-ranch)
