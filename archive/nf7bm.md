>you intercept kson after her stage appearance
>she's visibly uncomfortable and her eyes are fixed on the bathroom across the hall
>you tell her you're a big fan, and ask for an autograph
>she politely agrees, subtly resting a hand on her stomach
>after a minute of trying to find a pen, she signs your shirt
>while you waste her time, a crowd starts to form around the two of you
>suddenly 10, 20, 30 fans are swarming her with requests for pictures and autographs
>a visibly sweating kson tries to excuse herself, but nobody is listening
>20 minutes later, she's still surrounded, and the crowd only seems to be getting bigger
>when she squats down to sign a female fan's shoe, she lets off a loud brap
>"aw, sorry guys, the convention food really got to me"
>the crowd members laugh, until the smell hits their nostrils and makes them recoil 
>her face tenses up as an equally loud but even stronger smelling blast rips out of her ass
>"listen, I *really* gotta use the bathroom, can you guys wait here for me?"
>kson stands up and starts moving before anyone has the chance to answer
>the crowd parts at her obvious discomfort, now walking with one hand on her stomach and another covering her ass
>as she crosses the huge convention hall, a steady stream of gas trails behind her
>she finally makes it to the other side and approaches the bathroom door, every fibre of her being begging for relief
>**BAM**
>the door swings outward and hits her in the face
>"OMG, I'm sorry!" says the innocent looking girl leaving the bathroom
>kson, reeling from the impact, is in an awkward half-squat with her legs splayed
>"Oh fuck, no, goddamn it!" she whispers as the last of her control disappears
>her white pants instantly stain brown and swell as a giant log fills them up
>the fans look on with a mixture of pity and disgust as the unmistakable smell of shit begins spreading around the room
>kson is so overwhelmed with relief, she doesn't even realise how humiliated she should be
>the knots in her stomach are untying
>the weight in her guts is lightening
>the stretch of her asshole is exhilarating
>as soon as her first log is finished, another begins sliding out, and another after that
>the long, thick logs give way to a semi-solid mudslide, running all the way down her legs
>her pants begin to sag under the weight of the mess, exposing her curvy ass to a hall full of onlookers
>finally, after her superhuman dump ends in a round of wet, sputtering farts, kson's mind returns to reality
>lifting her pants up far too late, she realises the gravity of the situation
>every angle of the incident is being posted to YouTube, as well as some less savoury sites
>her name is beginning to trend on Twitter
>her outfit is ruined beyond repair
>as she gingerly shuffles out of the convention centre, texting a friend to pick her up, one thought sticks in kson's mind
>her reputation is just as soiled as her pants
>and neither stain can be washed off any time soon
