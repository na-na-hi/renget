Grade 10 Soul Cultivation: Unification of Worldly Meaning 
The cultivator connects their soul to the worldly flow of spiritual energy, finding within it meaning which serves to bolster their own soul. Comprehension of the connections between all things increase this cultivation. This technique may be used passively or actively, though active effort put into understanding the world will greatly increase cultivation speed. 
"All things are linked in a chain of relation. Thread the chain back, or forwards, to the beginning or end, and see how all things yearn to converge."

Profession[Geometry]:
A technique with a focus on geometric shapes and formations. At this level, the technique allows the cultivator to tie into universal patterns and formations, allowing for an increase in cultivation ability and technique strength when these patterns and formations are followed. 

Profession[Formation]:
Profession technique revolving around adherence to specific "formations" or "arrays". Works in tandem with the "Geometry" Profession to create an underlying style for the cultivator's techniques where patterns and formations are always an underlying structure in techniques even if an untrained eye is unable to spot them. 

Attack: Orderly Expulsion of Oneself Without 
Attack technique which utilizes the user's soul to alter worldly energies, firing a complex geometric shape of golden soul-energy. The energy picks up nearby natural elements and integrates them into the attack; an attack by a stream will include swirling and constantly moving patterns of water, for example. 
"Behold! With a simple extension of effort, the world bends to me. Gaze upon the beauty of Order, gaze, gaze!" 

Summoning: Egg-bearing Locus of Heavenly Light 
By expelling a golden fish egg from the mouth, the cultivator may implant it within a natural element to create a servant. Eggs can be borne in large swathes of up to five-hundred, or specially implanted one at a time. These singular eggs contain much more spiritual energy, which is then converted into strength over a long gestation period. 
"My children, born of my Qi, fueled by my soul, see how they serve their heavenly purpose?"

Endurance: Immortal Soul of Unpolluted Virtue 
A defensive technique that constantly reinforces the user through their virtuous acts. The strength of their soul is such that the world itself denies it injury, allowing him to stand tall even when under siege. 
"I am an arbiter of the true meaning of this world. My soul remains unfettered by your petty attacks." 

Qi Cultivation: All Rivers Flow to One Pond 
A Qi Cultivation technique which focuses on natural flows. Whether this is the flow of the winds, the flow of a crowd parting, a river cutting through a valley, or the flows of energy present in all things. By focusing on and attuning oneself to these flows, one's Inner World grows through simple appreciation and understanding. 
"See how all things connect? I was once within a pond, and I thought that pond my whole world. Now, I know that the world is a pond, and all things alter the course of all other things. See the ripples, see how they travel, follow that path..."

Dong Do is the leader of an Unorthodox Sect focused around grand machinations, formations, and geometry. High quality materials allow for grand, building-sized diagrams capable of performing great feats when powered. His position was, at first, extremely controversial within the Sect, but when his talent and strength showed themselves he quickly became greatly respected within the Sect, even if some Sects do not respect his position. Despite this, he remains respectful to all other Cultivators, for they all have their place in the world. 

Dong Do gained his position very long ago. His old master, a brilliant Soul Cultivator, would visit his pond every day, for many years. Dong Do subsisted off of his soul energy until the day his master died, sitting within the pond, pondering universal truths. When he died, his very soul stayed within the pond, and Dong Do ate it, inheriting his knowledge and his Soul Cultivation, gaining at the same time a humanoid body. 

Dong Do ponders the mysteries of the world and attempts to remain peaceful among any sects which meet his own. Despite the derision many of his peers feel, they respect his strength and wisdom, which is undeniable. His soul is a brilliant monolith, and he searches for any willing to listen to his wise words on the nature of all things.
