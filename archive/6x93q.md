Once upon a time, in the whimsical realm of Fyrefly Forest, an evil queen named Sweetheart reigned over a magnificent pink castle. Sweetheart was a living donut with a human-like shape. With long pink hair styled in playful twin tails, she possessed an alluring and seductive presence. Her figure was ample, with generous breasts and a curvaceous derriere, which she unapologetically used to her advantage, employing her charms to manipulate and achieve her every desire.

Under her iron rule, the Sprout Moles, adorable little plant creatures with no arms, were utterly devoted to Sweetheart. Bound by a love so deep it bordered on obsession, they obeyed her every command, even in the face of her cruel and malevolent nature. But there was one aspect of her rule that tested their loyalty—Sweetheart's refusal to feed them.

One fateful day, as the sun cast its warm embrace upon the sandy shores, Sweetheart found herself drawn to the beach. Donning a tiny bikini made entirely of delectable candy, she basked in the sunlight, her body glistening with sweat under the scorching rays. The aroma of the candy emanating from her bikini filled the air, tantalizing the hungry Sprout Moles.

Unbeknownst to Sweetheart, her loyal subjects were driven to the brink of starvation by her heartless negligence. The tantalizing scent of the candy became a trigger, awakening their primal instincts. With ravenous hunger clouding their minds, the Sprout Moles succumbed to their instincts and devoured the candy bikini that adorned Sweetheart's body.

Sweetheart gasped in shock as the Sprout Moles voraciously consumed the candy, leaving her ample chest and private parts exposed. In a desperate attempt to preserve her modesty, she covered her brown nipples and perfectly shaved pussy with her hands, her face contorted with both embarrassment and frustration.

"N-no! Cease this at once!" Sweetheart shrieked, her voice a mix of anger and disbelief. Her composure shattered, she found herself exposed, vulnerable to the insatiable hunger of her devoted subjects.

But the Sprout Moles, driven by their insatiable hunger, paid no heed to Sweetheart's demands. Driven to the point of frenzy, they continued their feast, with each bite, the wicked queen's cries grew more desperate, her attempts to shield her form futile against their relentless munching, their voracious appetite leaving no trace of the donut  queen.

A mixture of shock and horror washed over Sweetheart's face as her once-stunning form disintegrated before her eyes, devoured by the very creatures she had oppressed. Her voice wavered with a mix of fear and disbelief. "No... How could this be? I am... the prettiest..."

Swrithed in agony, her screams of anguish echoing through the forest...

As the last remnants of Sweetheart were consumed, the Sprout Moles paused, their hunger finally sated. The once-mighty queen had been reduced to a mere memory, devoured by her loyal but mindlessly famished subjects.

In the aftermath, a new era dawned upon Fyrefly Forest. With Sweetheart's reign of cruelty coming to an end, the Sprout Moles, now free from their misguided infatuation, found solace in their newfound liberation. The forest thrived under a more compassionate and fair leadership, where nourishment and care were extended to all its inhabitants.

And so, the story of Sweetheart, the donut queen, dissolved like the sugar melting in the summer sun. From the remnants of her empire, a lesson emerged—a reminder that cruelty and neglect could never sustain power, and that true strength lay in empathy and kindness.

That's it of course, until one of the Sprout Moles ate Life Jam and accidentally brought her back to life.
