“Testing! Hello? Testiiing~! Can you guys hear me?” Ame fiddled with the cumbersome VR headset as a slew of comments raced through her chat window. “Good. Good. Kinda low. Low. Too low. Okay, I'll turn it up.”

Today's stream was a special one. For the first time, Ame would be wheeling out some brand new, bleeding-edge tech from the wonderful world of VR, something so revolutionary that it promised to “redefine how players interact in the virtual world”. Though for such an ambitious piece of hardware, it was strange that no one in chat or in Hololive knew what she was talking about, and stranger still, the webpage she originally ordered from no longer existed.

Worst case scenario it was a scam, but it'd make for some interesting content either way.

“Alright, let's go!” The moment Ame hit [Play], the screen went pitch black and a low whine shook her eardrums. The ground seemed to fall out from her feet and an impossible gust of wind blew up from below, flapping her skirt over her hips.

A half-second later everything went quiet. The wind died down and Ame felt something like a matted carpet press against her feet. “W-what the heck was that? Is the stream still live? Hello?”

A small white circle in the center of her screen blipped into existence and exploded across her FOV. Ame stood in awe of the landscape rendering before her.

Soft rolling hills stretched out to the horizon like an endless sea and wispy white clouds drifted against a serene blue summer sky. Breaking up the land's verdant color palette were rows of great ivory wind turbines spinning far off in the distance. A cool breeze rippled the greenery in lazy waves and kissed the back of Ame's neck and thighs, ruffling her hair and throwing blades of grass in playful whirlwinds. Whatever engine this thing was running on was decades ahead of the curve.

Ame took a step forward, still transfixed by the uncompromising display of graphical fidelity, when she noticed a strange feeling beneath her soles. It was damp and a little cold, like walking barefoot on bathroom tile late at night. “Ooo, I can actually feel what I'm walking on!” There was unexpected novelty in simply walking in place, and Ame spent a while focusing on the lifelike sensations traveling through her body.

Eventually she snapped out of her trance and remembered her objective. “Wait, where's the city? I'm supposed to expand it and make it more efficient, right? Or do I start from scratch?” She tried to pull up the build menu, or any kind of UI, but nothing popped up. In fact, none of the buttons were doing anything.

As Ame became increasingly frustrated with her hardware's functionality, a $400 red superchat with an incomprehensible string of characters as a username slipped into her channel's feed. They offered three simple words of advice.

`Follow the road.`

“The road...?” Ame swept her gaze across the landscape and spotted a thin strip of gray in the distance. “That one? Okay~.” It looked pretty far away, so Ame struck up a casual conversation with chat to tide them over while she trekked all the way over to-

*Huh?*

Somehow, she was already there. Not only that, but the road appeared downright tiny in comparison to her stature. The length of her foot could easily cover both lanes and the concrete was fracturing just from her toes resting near it. Ame never noticed without proper reference in the empty fields, but she was *huge*.

It made sense from a design perspective, Ame reasoned. City builders are usually played from a high up camera to keep everything important on screen and to impart a certain feeling of omnipotence. Though it was a fresh experience to play one in first person and have your body interact with the world. Hopefully that twist wouldn't be too annoying to work with later in the campaign.

“Well, we found it. Let's see where this takes us...” She started down the path, arms swinging at her side.

A hundred meters to the north was a squat gas station. Old and poorly maintained, it cornered the market on drivers forgetting to fill up before hauling out to the middle of nowhere. In the shadow of the gas station's canopy, a stout man was filling up his tank with one hand and stuffing an empty chip bag into the trash with the other, when he felt a small tremor vibrate his shoes. He stared wide-eyed into the distance at a gigantic stacked blonde with some sort of glossy black visor across her eyes rapidly approaching from down the road. Her footsteps were terribly heavy, shaking the very earth and leaving car-sized footprints in the soil.

Despite the mortal terror pumping adrenaline through his veins, some primitive section of his brain funneled his attention squarely on Ame's heaving, shirt-straining bosom as it bounced up and down on her approach. Her fat tits rose and slapped against her chest on every step, indicating a decisive lack of support beneath her blouse. The cream-colored hem of her high waisted skirt fluttered pleasingly across her wide hips and, from his inherently low perspective, the cut of her black low rise panties and underside of her ass cheeks were on shameless display. Sheer stockings were pulled taut over her titanic, supple thighs, and pinched the fat ever so gently where the material terminated.

When she was less than a football field away, his survival instincts grabbed the reins from whatever impossible fantasy was running through his head and flung him into a panicked dash. The pump nozzle, still spewing gasoline, clanged unattended to the ground. There was no time to fully understand the situation, he just needed to escape what his brain could only interpret as a dangerous predator.

“Wait, is that guy running away from me?” Ame giggled and flew into a completely unnecessary sprint, as if the poor man had any chance of outpacing her stride. “Hey, don't run away! I'm the new mayor, I just wanna say hello!”

He rushed into a patch of taller grass that briefly obscured his form and Ame's prey blurred into the background. Everything was so far away from up there, it was hard to keep track of his scurrying movements.

The man felt the earth quake and something slam into his upper back. Suddenly, the sun went out.

“Huh? Where'd he go?” Ame slowed to a stop. She spun around and scanned for signs of her honorary first citizen but found only the gas station, endless fields, and dozens of messy footprints trailing behind her. Not that she could see it without bending down, but her target was dead center in one her footprints, smushed so deep into the cool soil by the balls of her stocking-clad foot that his previously portly form was flush with the surrounding terrain.

Ame shrugged and made her way back to the road. “Guess he despawned or something. I wanted to see how the dialogue worked in this but whatever, there's gonna be more later.“

As if on cue, a bright orange sports car gleamed over the horizon and sped towards Ame's towering frame. The driver thought she was some kind of statue or roadside attraction until Ame turned her head and looked into their eyes. They slammed the brakes and jackknifed their car to a rubber-burning stop in the middle of the road. Ame sauntered onto the lane with a cheeky smile and started running towards them, her powerful legs pounding the concrete into sand and flinging huge clods of earth into the air.

The driver's hands flashed over the steering wheel, knuckles white with heart-stopping tension as they stomped the gas pedal and peeled out in the other direction. Even behind the screaming turbocharger and screeching tires, Ame's footfalls pierced through the soundscape like thunder, growing louder and louder as she effortlessly closed the distance. The thudding impacts rattled the driver's keys in the ignition, then their coffee cup, then their entire body. A great shadow streaked in front of their headlights, wide enough to fully cover the lane, as Ame found her mark. The driver, sensing their end, looked up in disbelief through the sunroof.

Their last vision on Earth, the final memory to be etched behind their retinas to carry on into the afterlife was the damp grass-stained bottom of Ame's left stocking and the teasing black triangle of her panties peeking between her thick thighs.

“Gotcha!” Ame's foot drove deep into the earth, passing through the car, passenger, and meters of asphalt like paper mache. She barely registered the resistance of the car's central pillars bending and snapping beneath her weight as the road exploded into dust and large chunks of black asphalt. A single wheel popped off the rear axle and into a roadside ditch, the only component of driver and vehicle spared from total annihilation.

The clouds at the impact site were quickly swept away by the valley's stubborn winds, revealing Ame's foot deeply impacted in the middle of the road.

She wiggled her toes for a bit and felt tiny sheets of shifting metals and rubble rub against her soles. It was strangely satisfying, like digging your hands into a bag of fine grain. Warped pieces of debris fell from her foot as Ame lifted her leg and fully uncovered the wreckage. Curiously, the foot-shaped crater was largely empty. Ame frowned and raised her brow.

“What? Did this guy despawn too?” Still hovering her left foot in the air, she noticed a slight weight pulling on her stockings. She turned her foot and examined the underside. Sure enough, plastered to her immense sole was the flattened remains of her latest victim. The entire vehicle was pancaked to the thickness of a futon and strange dark liquid ran between the undercarriage's jagged creases and down her heel. The congealed mass of metal and grease creaked lightly whenever she flexed her foot. “Oh...there he is. That's kinda gross, can I get rid of this? I don't want it stuck to my model the whole time.”

Balancing on one leg, Ame lowered her left foot to the edge of the guardrail and tried scraping the wreckage off her sole. Despite being built to handle 2,000 pounds of careening metal, the guardrail quickly broke down and succumbed to Ame's modest application of pressure. “Ugh.” With an annoyed grunt,  Ame shifted all her weight to the left foot and dragged it against the road, shunting it back and forth like she was cleaning mud off her sneakers on a welcome mat. Misshapen clumps of metal and leather flecked off her sole and embedded themselves into the asphalt. It looked like the remains of an especially messy high speed collision.

As entertaining as this was, Ame was itching to get to the meat of this game. She wiped the remaining bits of scrap off her foot and set off once again. She did her best to engage with chat along the way which resulted in very poor spatial awareness, occasionally overtaking cars, trucks, and buses filled to the brim with commuters and turning them into greasy stains on the underside of her rapidly discoloring stockings.

Ten minutes passed and she didn't feel any closer to her goal. The only significant change was the landscape slowly shifting from hillsides to taller, more mountainous terrain. “You said to follow the road but there's nothing heeere~.” She halted her advance just in time to crunch an oblivious motorcyclist beneath her heel and grind them into paste like a mortar and pestle. “There's supposed to be a city. Where is it, chat? Tell me...or else!”

The thousands of viewers came up short. The best their collective minds could manage was variations of “I dunno.”, “Never played this.”, and emote spam. Ame considered ducking out for a minute to look up a guide when a familiar red box elbowed its way to the top of the discourse.

`You're close. Keep going. The town is around the bend.`

They might just be messing with her at this point, but Ame didn't have much else to go on. “Hahh...alroight~. There better be a checkpoint or something when I finally get there.”

Sure enough, tucked behind the next mountainous ridge was a humble suburban sprawl. The main road she'd been following splintered into smaller avenues lined with hundreds of boxy, three bedroom houses. All of them shared similar architecture with economically sized front yards and slanted roofs covered with dark blue tiles. Further inward were larger apartment complexes and tall office centers with hundreds of rectangular windows gleaming like smooth jewels in the afternoon sun. Thousands of unaware commuters bustled through the streets as they filled out their daily routine.

It was exactly as advertised-- an immersive, breathing city. A  playground ripe for creation...and destruction.

“Coool~.” Ame sauntered into the city limits with childlike wonder. The texture work was truly next level, even the most incidental lamp posts had intricate designs and notches on the base where they sprouted from the sidewalk. As Ame drank in the atmosphere, her untended lower body bulldozed through countless homes and parked vehicles, adding dozens of squished bodies to her colossal soles.

“Okay, so *now* I can build stuff, right?” In the middle of a busy intersection, the detective wriggled her fingers in an attempt to bring up the heretofore unseen main menu. Nothing responded. She might as well have been groping the air. “Ahhh, what the FUCK. Is this thing broken? It's not faiiir, I just bought iiiituh!”

`You can't build on top of another city. You have to clear out this one first.`

There it was again, the mystery sender with apparently a lot of money to burn. “If I can't build on another city, then why'd I even bother coming out here? Couldn't I just start in that grassy area?”

`Sorry. It doesn't work like that.`

Ame sighed and weighed her options. It sounded like a hassle to level a place this big, but this guy seemed to be the only one with answers. Maybe he was one of the developers or something? 

“Fine, we'll try it out.” Truthfully, Ame was planning to cause a bit more havoc anyway. Something about this game's feedback was just so alluring. It was tactile and weighty, like she was really ripping through tons of material.

“Let's start wiiiith...THIS!” She wound her foot back like a striker setting up for the game winning goal and punted a nearby bus stop with all her strength. The flimsy structure flew apart on contact, sending wrought lengths of iron and the vaporized remains of those taking shelter soaring high into the air and over the roofs of nearby buildings. The absurd display of power sent Ame into a laughing fit. “*Damn*, I really sent that thing! Okay, okay, what's next?”

The witnesses to her callous destruction were brimming on mass hysteria now, only overflowing once Ame turned her ice blue eyes to the crowd at large. Civility exited their minds as they shoved one another aside and ran screaming for safety.

She waded into the crowd and started trampling everything in sight. Cars, fleeing pedestrians, and entire department stores were stomped into mush under a barrage of heavy footfalls, each impact blowing back surrounding bystanders and ripping huge chunks of earth into the air as Ame pulled out to reposition her next attack. The ground was so worked and kneaded that it started to swim like heavy water every time Ame stomped down. 

Lost in her excitement, Ame's body got ahead of itself and she tripped over her own feet. She yelped in surprise as her colossal frame skipped and stumbled into a fully staffed office building across the road, her bouncy, fat tits briefly pancaked against dozens of windows at once. The white collar workers inside found their usual view of the town's skyline entirely filled up by Ame's impressive melons pressed flat against the glass. This vulnerable display lasted for but a second before the walls bowed inward and shattered spectacularly, her breasts bursting through within a glistening shower of glass and pinning the inhabitants firmly against the back wall. Their bodies were immobilized, entombed against a wall of soft, warm, cloth-wrapped flesh, smelling heavily of sweat and coconut shampoo. Their tiny bodies didn't stand a chance as Ame failed to regain her footing and fell even further down, collapsing into the rest of the building and smashing through all thirteen floors with her weighty bulldozing tits.

“Ouch! Damn it, stupid building...” Beneath her torso was the crushed pile of bricks and mortar that used to be a highly-trafficked office building. It was pretty uncomfortable to lie on and there was a lot of dust stinging her eyes, so she raised herself to a push-up position, her heavy knockers swinging pendulous below her.

A few feet away, hidden in the smog's low visibly, was a small group of workers who had managed to evacuate in time. Just as they finished picking themselves off the ground to make their escape, Ame's hand slipped out to the side and left her gigantic wobbling bust in free fall over the group. A soft *whump* shook the street as Ame's tits slapped into the pavement where the group was cowering, jiggling slightly after the impact. All that fat and mass made for a nice cushion so she didn't feel much aside from the dull pain of having her boobs smacked around. Ame repositioned and pushed herself to her feet. Finally clear of the clouds of choking dust, she absentmindedly brushed the rubble off her chest. The group smeared into her underboob were already dismissed as mere debris.

All the exertion left her the sweatiest she'd ever been on stream. Her shirt stuck close to her skin, turning see-through where the swell of her breasts strained against the material and giving a cheeky look into her sultry black lace brassiere. She undid her small red tie and let it hang loosely about her neck while she fanned herself and pondered her next move.

She was getting into the swing of things now, and she looked across the town with visible excitement on her face. Stomping everything into pulp would work just fine, but there was something else on her mind. She spied a throng of people fleeing down a major intersection. A nice, wide open area. 

Ame's eyes lit up. “Hold on, lemme try something.” She dropped onto her heels, swung her arms back, and pushed into the earth with all her strength, launching her massive frame skyward and trailing chunks of broken sidewalk behind her arc. At the apex of her jump, she tucked her knees to her chest, squishing her G-cup breasts to the side and flashing her nearly bare ass to the onlookers clustered in her rapidly growing shadow. Time slowed down as they watched Ame's massive fat ass drop out of the sky like a meteor, her short skirt flipped all the way up and flapping in the wind, revealing tiny black panties wedged so deep within her crack that the darker tone of her asshole peeked out from the edges.

A split second later, the entire intersection exploded beneath the immense weight of Ame's stupidly thick backside, shunting every parked vehicle in a hundred meter radius into the air and assaulting the streets with hundreds of simultaneous blaring car alarms. The pavement shattered into jagged, disparate chunks like a boulder plunging through a frozen lake. The resulting shock wave burst every window in the intersection and tore through the surrounding alleyways, the air pressure whipping up refuse and bystanders alike into an inescapable slipstream. Those downwind heard what they thought to be a bomb going off and witnessed a low cloud of gray smoke billowing from over the rooftops.

The unfortunate souls in the center of her impact zone were immediately flattened to unrecognizable stains on the detective's cheeks as hundreds of tons of plump detective ass mashed their fragile bodies into the ground. Those on the fringes that escaped a quick death were still pinned by her enormous rear, slowly feeling the air forced out of their lungs as Ame's weight settled in. Writhing like trapped insects, their tiny limbs desperately reached out from beneath a mountain of sweaty flesh for help that would never come

“Woo woo~! That does a lotta damage, huh?“ The area around her was a veritable disaster zone and random bits of infrastructure peppered the ground like the aftermath of a citywide riot. Still hugging her knees, Ame leaned back and ground her butt in the newly formed crater to make sure she didn't miss anyone. Her huge cheeks shifted and rolled mercilessly over the few survivors, either grinding them to paste on the spot or pulling them further underneath to meet an even more grisly end. Ame's ears picked up a few pops and squeaks as her butt pulverized her seat and decided to keep going until everything was nice and smooth.
 
When the “bumps” beneath her were flattened out, Ame giggled and got to her feet. A few stragglers on the bottom of her thighs were still stuck to her sweaty skin and got pulled along for the ride. Far from being spared, their small bodies were quickly wedged between the crease where the bottom of Ame's fat cheeks met the back of her thighs. Now painfully squished between two warm, sweaty masses of fat and muscle, they were fated to either suffocate in her sweltering folds or be crushed with the slightest flex of Ame's cheeks.

Ame looked down upon the new landmark she'd graciously added to the town's shopping district. It was a surprisingly detailed imprint of her ass and thighs, the concrete molded like soft clay and forced to capture the outline of her sizable bottom. Within the twin craters were all manner of pulverized forms, a coalescence of organic matter all piled and smashed into a multi-colored collage of carnage indistinguishable from one another. It was less humiliating, in a way, that at least the victims could barely be identified as human anymore.

She felt a strange tickle on her rear and reached back to scratch it, lazily dislodging a mass of stripped rebar from her jiggly cheeks and hearing it plink to the ruined earth below.

The crowd was eerily quiet after witnessing such brutal, uncaring devastation. Their blonde invader didn't even seem malicious, her attitude was more in line with someone just trying to have fun and pass the time. The way she stood there, casually wiping off the smears of dozens of warm bodies from her rear and adjusting her skirt like she'd just tripped and fallen in a puddle on the way to school, was callousness beyond imagination.

*One last thing...* She wouldn't usually do this on stream, but there was a lot of physical activity ahead and it's not like chat could see this anyway. Ame reached down under her skirt and dug the stubborn, incredibly sweaty wedgie out from inside her crack. A dazed citizen that had miraculously survived between her cheeks snapped to consciousness as Ame's finger bluntly and unknowingly mashed them against her tacky asshole. “Phew! That's better!”  Satisfied, she let her panties snap back over her cheeks, though the garment was still woefully undersized for the job and left most of her ass hanging out for anyone below to see. 

It had been a while since she checked chat, and her fist glance revealed some growing dissent.

`That's kinda cruel...`
`I feel bad for them ngl`
`focus on the buildings, don't bother with the people`
`AME OMG`
`This is gonna take forever`
`can she not just build in a different spot?`

“Hey, I'm the ruler here so I can do whatever I want! It's not gonna take that long anyway...” She crossed her arms and noticed a small apartment complex shorter than her knee placed conveniently behind her. She smiled and rocked back of her heels, simply letting gravity do the work. “Here, watch!”

Her earth-shaking ass plummeted through the building like it was nothing more than a layer cake. Powderized concrete blasted out the ground floor windows in great plumes as the structure imploded. Every resident barreling down the stairwell or hiding beneath their desks was quickly and thoroughly mashed into pulp. The basement was a bit more stubborn since it was originally built as a bomb shelter, so Ame had to bounce up and down to finish the job. The groaning of metal beams was the death toll for all those cowering inside. With a terrible screech, the shelter abruptly crunched under her weight and she felt the solid basement floor slap into her bottom. “Whoa!” She had sunk a few more meters into the ground, her giant butt now completely filling the basement and snuffing out anything within. “See? That was *easy*, I'll be done in no time!”

There was still the park, the stadium, and the business district to wipe off the map. Ame got up on her toes and gave a good long stretch. This was going to be a long stream.

____

Two in-game hours later, Ame was lying on her back in the middle of a once bustling downtown area. Her breath was labored, her blouse sticky and soaked through with sweat like she'd worn it through a triathlon. Her skirt was all but nonexistent after plowing through multiple districts of buildings and grinding countless bodies into dust. All around her was a hollowed shell of human achievement. Boxy foundations of collapsed buildings, roads gouged out to reveal sheared off sewer pipes, and vehicles smashed into flat stacks like the world's largest salvage yard were but a smattering of the bleak horrors Ame had visited upon this corner of civilization.

“Hahh...hahh...okay...I'm gonna have to, uh, call it for today.” Ame grabbed a nearby banner from the town's recent summer festival and wiped down her excessive cleavage sweat. “But that was really fuuun~. We can come back to it later now that we finished clearing everything out.”

She started rolling to her stomach as she wrapped up the stream with final thoughts and thank yous. At the same time a lone survivor, the last of their kind for miles, was slowly crawling away from Ame's resting place. They made it another three inches before Ame's hips rolled over them and her cunt pinned them to the ground. It was a sensitive area, so she actually felt their presence. She cleared her throat and, subtly as she could, pressed her crotch into the earth and quickly ground the trespasser into nothingness. “We'll read superchats tomorrow, thanks for watching! Buh-byeee~.”

The screen flicked off and Ame was back. She was still laying down on her stomach, though now surrounded by the familiar sights and sounds of her bedroom. Her clothes were still sweaty and in disrepair. Upon closer inspection, all the collected stains and bits of “dirt” were inexplicably present as well.

She sighed and started unbuttoning her top. There was something fishy about this whole thing that needed some serious investigation down the line. But for right now, what she really needed was a hot shower.
