###my boats

i am a boat connoisseur. i put all my public boats here in case chub dies or whatever
these boats are sfw unless otherwise stated. the style i use is wmudds, there is no public style guide for it (because it's kind of a mess)
please direct queries, comments, logs, and critiques to foxioioio@protonmail.com
(fair warning, my gens kind of suck, usually i don't bother with them for characters but you need one to make a card and jsons never import as well) 
anywayyyy, thank you for checking out my rentry! i love when people use my boats
