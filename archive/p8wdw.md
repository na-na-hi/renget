Skyrim lacks in the creature department, it can get very repetitive killing wolves and trolls for hours on end. Hopefully this guide will add some more life to your game.
 
 
Mihail Mods:
Mihail has released alot of monster/creature mods through the years, this is a selection of monster mods of his. All credit goes to Mihail and if you don't agree with the edits done to the mod you can easily go and download the main file from the nexus. No offense to Mihail, I just personally edited these mods to my taste and felt like sharing them. Also, a word of warning, some Mihail mods add very difficult to beat enemies, especially for low level players.
 
Mihail Bats: https://mega.nz/#!03JmnYbZ!yvcCrAtIgHkF-IIAWZRTbicVQuU8rhgSq-s1Wq9sCg0
Adds giant bats to fight, this edit removes the ancient bat that was just a silly sized boss version of it.
 
Mihail Cats: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30496
This is simply a port of Mihails cats mod. This mod adds one or two cat to each vanilla town. They don't do much but patrol the city, but it's nice to see cats in Skyrim. 
 
Mihail Land Dreugh: https://mega.nz/#!UupEmCCY!b3K7r2KX0cNMXVaPWecDIl5si4eVRF3IDOzTBh-X2T0
All this edit does is remove the overpowered Broodmothers.
*Note if you have Moon and Star installed make sure Land Dreugh loads first and Moon and Star after it. I also HIGHLY recommend getting this patch I made that makes the citizens of Little Vivec essential, so the Land Dreughs don't slaughter the whole town: https://mega.nz/#!t3RGiIiB!gUafkahsEtzklxYbJ1vkwE-rbWIX3ClhP6uLE0pOODA
 
Mihail Seals and Sea Lions: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29204

Mihail Falmer Abyssraiders: https://www.mediafire.com/file/qyguph8sbg401ac/Falmer_Abyssriders.zip/file
Adds a calvary like enemy to the samey falmer dungeons. While it's just another falmer it's a new type of falmer and can be fun to fight.
 
Mihail Bantam Guars: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27363
Gives Solstheim it's own version of chickens.
 
Mihail Pigeons: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27238
Do I really need to say more? Makes the cities feel alive.
 
Mihail Squirrels: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26191
Gives the woods of skyrim a more authentic feel as you see these little guys run away from giant monsters trying to kill it.
 
Mihail Pahmar Mercenaries: https://mega.nz/file/svwCTAbZ#_C0jwge2vHBVdTEkzLBHW224AhKLSIPALryIkXRuW4k

They even drop leveled list loot!
 
Mihail Serpents: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26165
Cmon, I go by the name Snake, how did you expect me to NOT recommend this one?
 
Mihail Giant Mantis: https://www.mediafire.com/file/9o23lvsjx2rlcdo/Giant_Mantis.zip/file

Adds a hybrid goblin and riekling creature to the various northern dwemer ruins, they even come with fur covered durzogs!
*This edit is my attempt at making them more "balanced" since they tend to be in large groups. I don't know if this is really any better but I tried.
 
Mihail Draugr Cavalry: https://mega.nz/file/1qpDRSAa#RhVYAV1pOXAWEWXiU7YWfIgsvlAn-XgVnkcrpHb5dPY
This mod adds horse riding Draugr to the game. 
*Now this mod is heavily edited from the original, I cut down the HP and damage output so they don't one shot players or NPCs as well as reducing the number of them you meet by half so you're not killed in seconds by 8 of them ontop of you. Hopefully I made them more balanced.
 
Mihail Grummites: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46526
Adds the Grummites from Oblivion to the world of Skyrim!
 
Mihail Dwarven Colossus: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27354
Possibly one of his most famous mods, this mod adds the massive Dwarven Colossus from ESO to Skyrim. Note that this IS a boss fight so he WILL be hard. I HIGHLY recommend this patch that balances him a bit: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33515
 
Mihail Dwarven Defender: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36836
Nice little addition to making your dwemer ruins more dangerous.
 
Mihail Dugongs and Manatees: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31228

Adds different colored Harpies and Harpy nests to the Reach.
 
Mihail Wampas: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26166
I know, a Star Wars creature? But it's really high quality. I think they fit well in the more northern reaches of Skyrim, but feel free to skip this one if it seems to silly to you.
 
Mihail Mating Crabs: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51536
Just a small quality of life monster mod.
 
Mihail Emperor Penguins: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62696
A much better penguin mod.

Bogmort - Mud Monsters of Morthal Swamp: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22447
Adds a mud version of the ash spawns to Morthal. (This patch though adds a new mesh to them, a disfigured look. Missing parts of the body and exposed skeletons. Giving them more of a undead/zombie feel than the brown ash spawns that the original mod gives: https://mega.nz/file/k6okjZ5S#oidfOpYT4KKS_wu6nnTG3oDEhXF5-CRpzuypUFT86nA)
