It's been a few months since that "incident," Sunny had finally told everyone the truth. Basil was horrified that this would be the end of him, but to his surprise this one moment had finally set him free. No longer did the shadow of Mari's death entangle his every waking moment, his old friends forgave him after hearing the whole story, Polly had sent him to therapy but didn't turn her back on him, and the only police officer in Faraway Town had replied with "fuck off, I'm on my break" when the incident was reported. Of course the guilt still haunted, of course he still awoke some nights to feelings of Mari's hair on his arms, but for the most part the truth had finally allowed him to live.

And god damn did his missed years come back and hit him like a truck. Now that his mind had finally cleared enough to allow him to think of other things that boys his age should, and that Aubrey had taken him under her arm into her new friends group (which just so happened to include a couple decently attractive females), his new found freedom had manifested years of lost urges all at once. Basil just could not stop himself from thinking about girls, Aubrey's flat tummy and large bum, Kim's thick thighs in her tight pants, but one of them lorded above them all...

"O-oh Polly~" Basil moaned, sitting on the edge of her bed completely naked, a pair of used panties he'd dug out of her laundry pressed against his nose.

The poor lad was doomed from the start, Polly's presence in the house had been a source of much of his raging hormones over the months. She was a goddess in his eyes, a source of kindness and warmth, nurturing and care, and a great pair of tits! The warm smile on her feminine Mediterranean face had once brought him some comfort, now it made him hard as a rock when he pictured it above a pair of large, bouncing, cappuccino colored tits and inhaled the smell of her frilly white panties.

"Oooh god Polly! Poooollllyyyy!" He moaned out again, death grip on his own cock as he pictured her in his head.

"Yes Basil, are you alri-"

Basil's stopped dead in his tracks as his eyes shot open. Sure enough, standing there at the door and staring at him with wide eyes, was Polly.

"O-oh, hi Polly, I-I thought you were gonna be out today." Basil tried to sound as calm as possible, but he was inches from a breakdown.

"The store was closed" Polly replied, also trying to sound nonchalant, her voice betraying some shock.

They simply stared at each other in awkward silence, Polly could already see Basil's eyes beginning to water over. Truth be told, as much as she wanted to to tell herself she was shocked to have seen this, a hint of a smile touched the corner of her lips. Basil was such a sweet boy, such a sensitive boy, such a... Cute boy. She swore she'd do everything she could to protect him and make herself a mother figure for him, to try to make him feel like he was safe around her, could open up to her; but another small part of him wanted to just TAKE that tiny boy.

"I..." Basil began to stammer, "I was just..."

He could only hold himself together for a few more seconds before his emotions got a hold of him and the water works started.

"I'm sorry Polly!" He screamed, dropping her panties on the floor and covering his face with both hands, "please don't hate me! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!..."

He repeated himself over and over, his weak little shoulders heaving as he sobbed into his hands. Polly hated seeing him like this... Well... As much as she hated to admit it even to herself, but seeing Basil during his "vulnerable" moments was actually wonderful for her. It always gave her an opportunity to hold him close to her, maybe even give him a kiss on the forehead, but with this context...

Polly immediately rushed over to Basil, just barely stopping herself from tackling him onto the bed, instead just sitting down beside him and pulling him into a tight hug.

"There there Basil, it's okay..." She kissed him on the forehead, "I'm not mad at you."

Her heart skipped a beat when Basil's tear filled eyes stopped and looked at hers, his face mere inches from hers.

"Y-you're not?..." he just barely managed to mumble out.

She broke off the hug and put both her hands on his cheeks, kissing him on the forehead again before her hands went to the back of his head and pulled his face into her neck. "Of course not Basil! You're a growing boy, it's perfectly normal for you to have these sorts of feelings."

Basil pulled away from her, much to her dismay, his face was still freely leaking tears but now a hint of confusion was on his face.

"What?" He sniffed, "I-I mean, for stealing your panties and thinking about you, and..."

Polly quickly took his face in her hands again and kissed him, but not on the forehead this time. Basil's whole body went stiff when Polly's lips pressed against his, her soft, moist lips... His eyes closed and his body surrendered, a few residual tears still fell from his eyes but a wave of warmth seemed to fill his whole body.  Polly broke off the kiss and pulled Basil into another hug.

"Shhhh, it's okay Basil, mommy would never be mad at you."

Basil loved the feeling of Polly's hugs, they were so soft and tender, so filled with love, even when he was struggling with The Truth Polly's hugs would help ease the pain for just a se- Wait, mommy?

Before he could say anything one of Polly's hands grabbed the back of his head and pulled him into another kiss, but this one was different. It was... Forceful. Even her usually tender hug tightened up into a more restraining one. This wasn't the same Polly that Basil had always known, this was a hungrier one, a less restrained one. He still felt the love and warmth he'd always felt around Polly, but there was just something a little more...

Polly broke off the kiss again and stood up, one of her hands gently resting on Basil's shoulders as she stared down at him with a warm smile. In the next second she gave the confused boy an uncharacteristically firm shove, throwing him onto the mattress. Basil crawled back a little until he was fully on the mattress, stopped, and just stared at Polly.

Smile warm as ever, her hands gripped the skirt of her dress and began to pull it up slowly. The hem pulled up over her large tanned thighs, over her white frilly panties, revealed her not quite chubby but soft belly, over her sizable bra firmly holding her generous chest in place, and finally the dress came up and over her head and was thrown to the floor. Polly simply stood there, striking a subtle pose as Basil stared wide eyed and red faced. He absolutely drank in the sight of her, her soft mature figure, her smooth latte skin. She LOVED seeing him so flustered and aroused by her.

Basil began breathing a little hard as Polly's thumbs hooked the sides of her panties and she pulled them down to her ankles, stepping out of them and towards the bed. He began to panic a little again as her knees came up on the mattress, and once again backed up from her until his shoulders pressed against the headboard. Polly was undeterred, she simply followed him, hands reached back to undo her bra. Eventually her knees came up on either side of Basil, and quickly she squeezed her calves and thighs around his abdomen, trapping him in place.

Basil's face was red as a beet now with Polly's bra right in his face, and the cutest little whimper escaped him when said bra was thrown aside. They were just like he imagined them, no, better! Those beautiful, full, heavy breasts with their cappuccino skin and milk chocolate nipples. He wanted them in his face, but he was a shy boy and dared not make the first move. Thankfully for him, one of Polly's hands grabbed the headboard just above his head and the other grabbed hold of her heavy tit and offered it up to Basil. He practically swallowed the nipple with how eagerly he latched onto it.

"That's it, there's my good boy..."

Basil's hands grabbed the heavy flesh, sinking into their softness as his mouth eagerly sucked on it. The only thing he lamented about this moment was that there was no milk, in his fantasies there was always milk. That small detail was forgotten completely when Polly decided Basil had a good enough hold on his own and her hand slowly traced down his own. She went to his chest, stopping at his nipple and giving it a a light rub, the sensation made Basil jump a little, but then a firm pinch made him stop, Polly's nipple coming out of his mouth with a loud pop.

"Polly stop, I don't like my-"

Polly's hands grabbed Basil's wrists with a firmness he'd never known from her before and pressed them against the headboard, he yelped a little when it happened.

"Basil! I didn't raise a selfish boy! Mommy lets you play with her chest as much as you want but you won't let her even touch yours?" She looked angry for a brief second, but a grin revealed it to be fake, "honestly! I'm gonna have to teach you some manners!"

Basil's yelped and jumped when Polly's own mouth came down on his nipple. The strange sensation from his chest of Polly's hot tongue circling and flicking his small nipples was completely foreign to him, especially when her lips closed around it and began to suck on the thing. He tried to process it, was it a pleasant or unpleasant one, did he enjoy it? It was just so strange to him he didn't even know. Again he yelped when he felt her teeth come down on the tiny nub, not hard enough to cause pain but still it panicked him. He began to fight against Polly's hold.

"Polly! I don't like this! Stop!"

Polly freed her mouth for just a second, "manners, Basil..." and then got back to it.

"Please Polly!"

Polly pulled of Basil's chest with a pop again, "'Polly?' Oh no, you're going through your rebellious phase... Well, guess I'll have to keep teaching you a lesson."

Basil didn't know when she wanted, he thought again, and then he remembered what she'd been calling herself this whole time.

"Mommy Please! I don't like this!"

He could feel Polly's lips curl into a smile against his chest as she finally raised herself off him and brought her face mere inches from him.

"Awww, I'm sorry sweetheart, I guess you're not ready for that... Yet." There was just the slightest hint of naughty malice on her voice as she said the last part. "Don't worry baby, mommy will take it slow."

She gave Basil a quick kiss and then pulled him into a firm hug, sitting him upright and wrapping her legs around his back. Basil felt trapped, Polly's grip around his arms was just thigh enough to keep him in place as one of her hands firmly pressed his face against her breast. 

She raised herself a bit, "come on sweetheart, mommy can't do all the work."

It took Basil a few seconds to understand what she wanted. When he did he moved his hand, restrained as it was, to his penis and lined it up again Polly's waiting lips. Even just brushing against it Basil could tell it was soaking wet. The moment Polly felt it was in place she sat herself back down, her grip on Basil don't loosening for a second. Basil moaned into her breast as her warm, wet flesh swallowed him.

"Good boy" she whispered, kissing him on the forehead.

The sensation of Polly's body rubbing against Basil as she bounced up and down on him was something even his wildest fantasies could replicate. He felt completely surrounded by her, her sweat and his own mixed together, his own body sinking into her soft flesh as her grip tightened to bring him as close to her as possible. Basil felt like he was melting into Polly, and he LOVED it! He wanted to be hers, he wanted everything he had, everything he was, to be just a part of her. He'd forfeited his body, it wasn't his anymore, it was Polly's. 

He noticed Polly's nipple poking him in the face, and quickly latched onto it, sucking and at the sweaty, salty nub. This time it was Polly who jumped at the sudden sensation, and her grip on him tightened almost to the point of pain as she started to bounce more frantically. 

"That's it baby! Y-you're such a good boy!" 

Basil could hear Polly's voice losing its composure a little, even she was losing herself to the pleasure. He own arms, struggling against her grip, just managed to wrap around her and pull with all their might as he tried to press himself into her even tighter. Polly's own hold tightened even further in response, Basil began gasping for air through his nose, but his mouth stayed firmly planted on her nipple.

"J-just hold out a little longer!" Polly begged, noticing Basil's difficulty breathing. "I'm..."

Her speed increased frantically again, Basil felt something raising in him.

"So..."

He never imagined he'd ever feel this sensation he knew only from fantasies about Polly in reality. Tears of joy began to turn down his face at just the mere idea that this was actually happening.

"Close..."

Polly brought herself down with one more hard bounce and let out a scream, Basil would have actually been worried about the neighbours hearing if not for his own pleasure. Rope after rope of cum shot up into Polly, his own weighed down hips tried thrusting themselves up as he emptied his load into her. It was completely unlike his masturbation orgasms, the intensity was on a level he couldn't imagine, and before he even finished coming his vision went dark...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Basil snuggled up in his bed when he started to wake up, it felt better this morning than it had ever for some reason. It was just so warm and soft, somehow he's managed to wrapped his arms around the strangely firm blanket, and it almost felt like the blanket was hugging him back. He pressed his face deeper into the pillow, slightly musky smelling but in an oddly pleasant away, and just listened to it's soft and calming breathing...

Wait, what?

He's eyes quickly opened to the sight of a pair of bare, tanned breasts. When his head turned up he found himself looking into the beautiful brown eyes and warm loving smile of Polly. It all came rushing back to him as he realized he wasn't in his bed and he was completely naked under the sheet with his caretaker.

"You talk in your sleep you know, it's adorable!" Polly said, rubber her nose against his.

Basil turned completely red, his mind finally processing that last night wasn't some very elaborate wet dream and he was actually here now.

"I... Uhhh... What..." Basil tried to think of anything to ask about last night, Polly giggled a little which detered him, instead settling on "w-what was I dreaming about."

Polly kept one arm wrapped loosely around Basil's back and lifted her head on the other. She loved seeing Basil so embarrassed, it was adorable watching him squirm around and try to look anywhere but her eyes and her breasts.

"Me, mostly" she answered with a smug tone

"Oh..."

Polly giggled again, "you should probably go take a shower, you have school pretty soon."

Basil turned to look at the clock, and nearly jumped out of the bed upon realizing just how late he was. Quickly he tried gathering up his clothes off the floor, frantically pulling his shorts out of Polly's dress.

"Oh, and Basil."

"Y-yeah Polly?" He asked, clumsily pulling his underwear back on.

"About what you were saying in your sleep, if you REALLY want to be my property, well..." The look on her face was smugger than Basil ever saw it before, he didn't even realize she was capable of such an evil grin. "I think we can arrange that easily enough."

Basil's breathing got heavy as his face turned even redder, he quickly rushed towards the shower.

"And remember! It's 'mommy' now mister!"
