#The Early Bird Gets The FIGHT

Bogey was pissed off and blue-balled. He had failed in his attempts to grab those Korean sluts, but he was going to get some one way or another. He had returned to the same spot he got snubbed, hiding his massive form in a bin. Not that he particularly cared; he was here for one thing, and that was NOT decent resting conditions. He had needed to lay low anyway; turns out those whores were daddy’s little girls, and now there were a bunch of pro-heroes alerted to his whereabouts. Fortunately, he was excellent at stealth (despite his gargantuan size), and they were dumb enough to search everywhere except the exact place that he was reported. What kind of internationally wanted villain would stay exactly where he was after being detected anyway?

	**Name:「Bogey, The Creeping Villain」**
	**Quirk:「Arms」**

	Type: Mutant

	Description: Bogey's body consists of an extremely elongated torso, with dozens of arms on either side! Each arm is stronger than a normal human's, so just think what a dozen of them can do! An internationally wanted criminal, he preys on women in particular, the smaller and weaker the better. What a vile villain!


Like a true insect, he skulked in the shadows, out of the light and sight of polite society. He had been hiding in a dumpster, unable to sleep owing to distraction, when luck must have smiled on him. This big dumb bitch was just strolling down the street all by herself in the early morning with no witnesses! Well clearly, she was just asking for it, so Bogey wasn’t even doing anything wrong, was he? He didn’t care either way; he wanted some, she was here, he was going for it.

His 10-foot-long body slipped out of the dumpster; any sound reduced across his dozens of arms. He creeped down the street toward his prey. Now she was groping her chest! Bogey began to pant under his hooded rags, it took all he had not to break and charge. He got closer. She was bigger, much bigger, than his usual targets. Not as big as he was long, but bigger than any he had had before, in more ways than one. His eyes were locked on her, until he was less than a body length from her. When he felt he was close enough, that any closer risked detection, he darted forward, intending to knock her over and get on top of her straight away. So, he was surprised when instead of an easy tackle, it felt that he had run into a wall. He was momentarily dazed, only a couple of his arms managed to grab on.

Kaylee was shocked, disgusted, and slightly scared. What the hell was this thing!? It looked like a centipede, with dozens of limbs, but she could see that they were in fact arms. It was covered in a filthy rag that only barely hid its repulsive body, and as she stared at its foul form, its sickening stench hit her. She managed to resist barfing and leapt backward, breaking out of its grip without any difficulty. She gagged and looked at where its horrid hands had touched her, thankfully it had only touched her clothes, but judging by how it was slapping the ground, she doubted that it was going to run away.

“What the hell are YOU?”

Bogey eyes widened in anger that the meat dared to talk back to HIM! He began panting and moaning, the meat visibly disturbed, until he could no longer contain it. He reared more than half his body up, arms reaching and grasping forward, and barrelled forward in a veritable wall of flesh.

Kaylee’s eyes widened at the vile sight but snapped into battle mode. If this thing wanted a fight, then she was going to give it to it. She easily dodged the ungainly charge, before delivering a vicious roundhouse kick into its back. She felt something snap beneath the cloak, and hoped it was the thing’s spine, as it crashed forward into a pile of arms. 
Bogey corrected himself with surprising speed. He had expected a dumb bitch that would be easy, but he could feel that she had broken his arm! He liked that arm! Well, he wasn’t going to let her have an easy time of it now, no more Mr nice Bogey!
Kaylee saw it begin to circle her, pacing as it walked on its countless arms. So much for breaking its back, she thought. But she could now get a good sight of it; it was shaped like a centipede crossed with a human, with each arm seeming to be fully functional as an arm. She could see and hear it crack the concrete in its grip, so it wasn’t a stretch to think that it had super strength. She smirked as she thought back to earlier today. She wondered where this thing would rank against her classmates. She began matching its circling, the two of them seeming to set up a ring for their battle. 
It didn’t take more than a couple of seconds for both of them to lose their patience with it. With a sound between a moan and a growl, Bogey launched itself forward again, but stayed much closer to the ground. He had no intention to get kicked again. He planned to get the meat into a grapple and enjoy. She may have super strength as well, but he had more arms. If it took him half a dozen arms per limb, he’d still be able to pin her. He tried to grab her legs, she leapt over him, and he turned to catch her on the drop.  What he wasn’t expecting was her to be floating in the air. He tried to catch a glimpse of her crotch, only to have her suddenly launch downward in a drop kick. He moved his hands to grab her leg, but she was moving too quickly to just stop. He felt the kick slam into him, bones crunching under the force, but he had her! He latched his hands onto her foot, but before he could tear away the shoe to get to the skin, her other leg kicked out, shattering the arms grabbing her right off of his body, filthy ichor that only barely resembled blood gushing out of the stumps. But Bogey was too horny too care. There was female meat so close, and he WANTED it. He launched his body toward Kaylee, curling himself inward around her legs, so quickly that her eyes widened at it. His remaining arms, still dozens in number, grabbed frantically and fueled by lust. Kaylee’s fists smashed down on him, more arms breaking under the onslaught, but Bogey didn’t care, he had feet! Before he could get any further though, he found that his hands were burning. Then he found his grip, indeed his whole body, being blasted back. The second time in as many minutes he found himself in a crumpled pile, looking up at his target. 
Kaylee was surrounded with a green fire, her muscles bulging with power. She was absolutely furious now, her battle rage flaring in full effect. This freak had done it now, and it was going to die. She blasted forward, flying with rage and fury toward her target. Bogey reared up to meet her, only to get punched so hard in the face that his jaw nearly came off. A vicious hook punched through his armor of arms and sank into his flesh. Other arms of his tried to grab that arm that had injured him so, wrapping around it to both grapple her and protect his internal organs. Her response was simple and deadly; she took off flying again, before punching her wrapped hand down into the road, dragging the human centipede through the asphalt. She dragged the freak for over a hundred yards before she felt its grip loosen, at which point she threw the human centipede into a car. She created a pulsing green orb in her hand and threw it at the wreck. The resulting explosion and pillar of fire lit up the early morning sky, set off other car alarms nearby, and seemed to still the monster. 
Kaylee grinned seeing the destruction, something deep inside her relished it. She began to laugh, and was about to throw more destruction, when she heard a voice behind her.
“Ho Ho! Well done, young student, but let the pro take over from here!”
She knew that voice, it was the voice of one of her teachers. It cut through the growing red fog in her mind, as she remembered; the no.6 pro hero in Japan, the Combat Teacher at Shiketsu, Majestic!

!!! note

	**Name:「Yasashi Koibito | Majestic」**
	**Quirk:「Heat Vision」**

	Type: Emitter

	Description: Majestic is able to emit lasers from his eyes! These lasers can be as small and weak as laser pointers, or as large and powerful as military weapons, and everything in between! His hard work and savvy approach to the media has gotten him to the number 6 ranked pro hero position!


The teacher kept talking as he walked in front of Kaylee, positioning himself in front of the wreck.
“You’re certainly an early bird, both for the hour and for the heroics! Tut tut, you know that you shouldn’t perform quirk heroics without your license! Well, seeing how well you did, I think it can be forgiven this time!”
Bogey crawled out of the wreckage. He was more burned looking than ever, especially on the arms which he had used to try and shield himself from the blast and flames. Forget getting some, he just wanted to get away now. Unfortunately for the villain, as be tried to move, a pair of laser beams cut in front of him. He looked up into the face of the pro hero.
“Bogey, isn’t it? Fitting name. We can do this the easy way or the hard way. You can either surrender and be taken into custody, or I can’t guarantee your safety.”
As he finished his sentence, his eyes glowed, and two pin prick lasers cracked the ground in front of Bogey. The villain looked around, looked up at the pro hero, looked behind him to the girl who damn near killed him, and raised his front four arms in surrender.

With almost prescient timing (and perhaps a tip from a certain teacher), the news arrived to document the scene. Spilling out of vans and cars, a couple were even on foot, they all wanted footage for the morning hour and photos for the sites. Majestic put on his trademark grin, whipped out a pair of handcuffs, and slapped them on Bogey’s front arms once the cameras had him in focus. Moments after they got their shots, the police arrived to take the villain into custody. Majestic made sure to get some nice angles of him handing the criminal over, before returning to the now-waiting interviewers with their microphones.
“Majestic, sir, how did you-”
“Mr Majestic, what were your thoughts as-”
“Majestic, do you have any comments on-”
The pro hero gave a practiced laugh, before speaking.
“Well, I can’t take ALL the credit for this apprehension of a vile criminal! Props have to go to a great student of mine, miss Kaylee Suzuki! Come over here, get your deserved praise!”
Kaylee almost snapped out of a stupor. One moment she had been enjoying pummeling the freak, the next a teacher had appeared, taken control of everything, and was mugging for the cameras. In something of a daze, she went over to the gaggle, Majestic dragging her into a side-hug. She felt more than slightly ridiculous next to her much shorter teacher, but he seemed undeterred as he continued to charm the journalists. She found herself zoning out again, until Majestic squeezed her in and seemed to mention her.
“That’s right, a first-year student of mine! Just goes to show, there’s no better Hero Academy than Shiketsu! Ha Ha Ha!”

Kaylee thought to herself. On one hand, it was clear that Majestic was taking credit for HER fight and HER victory. On the other hand, she was still getting past the shock of fighting a villain (and such a disgusting one as well) and the cameras weren’t helping. She found that she just wanted to go back to the gym and lift heavy things until the weird sensation went away. She decided to just follow the teacher’s lead, and when he told her to smile for the cameras, she gave an uncomfortable smile as the cameras flashed.

The fight made the morning news, and the front page on more than one news site. Of course, all credit was given to the pro-hero, and how modest he was giving such praise to a student, and a first year no less! Only the dedicated readers, who read the entire articles, would notice the small comments on his latest scandal, but the modern era meant there were few of them.

Majestic sipped his first coffee. What a good start to the day.
Kaylee went back to the gym and got washed again. She just wanted to put the morning in the past.
Bogey was scheming in the back of the police van. He was plotting his escape already.
