I blink my eyes open, my surroundings shifting into focus. It feels different this time, almost surreal. I'm no longer a Clamperl, no longer submerged in a world of Pokémon. Instead, I find myself sitting in the familiar confines of the Principal's office at my high school. It's as if the events that unfolded just moments ago were merely figments of my imagination.

My mother sits beside me, her face filled with a mixture of concern and pride. Principal Royce, a stern yet compassionate figure, leans forward across his desk, his gaze fixed upon me. They're engaged in conversation, discussing my academic achievements, but their words seem distant and muffled as my mind struggles to fully comprehend this apparent return to human form.

"Sterling, you have always excelled academically," Principal Royce states, his voice laced with a mix of admiration and frustration. "But we've noticed that you tend to isolate yourself from your peers. It's important to engage socially, to form connections with your classmates."

My mother's eyes meet mine, filled with a mixture of love and concern.

"Sweetheart, we want what's best for you. It's important to find a balance between your studies and connecting with others. Building relationships will open doors for you in the future."

I nod absently, my attention drifting away from the conversation. Thoughts swirl within my mind, fragments of memories intermingling with this bewildering reality. It feels so vivid, so real, that I can't help but wonder if this is a dream within a dream. I was just with Sentret and Happiny was I not? I was a Clamperl.

As they both notice my distant gaze, Principal Royce clears his throat and speaks with a touch of gentle concern. "Sterling, is everything alright? You seem lost in thought."

I snap back to attention, my voice barely above a whisper as I reply, "I... I'm sorry. I'm just... lost in my own thoughts." I dart my eyes around the room, trying to make out anything remotely familiar. But I can’t even read the words on the loosely hung posters on the brick walls.

"Sterling, are you alright?" my mother's voice breaks through the haze of my thoughts, filled with genuine concern. I meet her gaze, searching for answers in her eyes.

"Where's Dad?" I ask, my voice trembling with a mix of curiosity and trepidation. The question hangs in the air, and I notice a flicker of reluctance in my mother's expression. 

"He... he's not here right now, Sterling," she replies, her voice tinged with a hint of sorrow. The words leave an ache in my chest, a reminder of the fractured relationship that exists between my father and me, I also stare at her longingly as if this would be for the last time.

Before the silence can stretch any longer, Principal Royce interjects, attempting to redirect my attention. 

"Sterling, let's focus on the present, shall we? I understand that there may be unresolved matters, but for now, let's concentrate on your academics."
He leans forward, his tone encouraging. 

"I'd like you to complete the homework assignment I gave you. I want you to take a moment and write down what you envision for your future. It's important to have a sense of direction, to set goals for yourself."

As his words sink in, a familiar sense of déjà vu washes over me, as if I've lived through this very scenario before. The weight of uncertainty settles upon me, knowing that even the principal is uncertain about my aspirations. Time feels like it's slipping away, yet unmoving.

I slowly nod. He hands me a red notebook, the words on the cover swirling together as if made of water. I look at it highly curiously and flinch for a moment. I turn my gaze toward my mother, seeking solace in her presence, only to be met with a visage twisted with concern and worry. Her face contorted and evil. Her genuine care, now being made into such a horrific display tug at my heartstrings, and a tear wells up in my eye. She smiles, her head cracking as she tilts it downwards.

A wave of unnatural fear washes over me, as if some unseen force lurks in the depths of this disconcerting dream. I lift my eyes, searching for answers, but instead of Principal Royce, I find myself locked in a gaze with a white-haired girl. Her ethereal presence stands in stark contrast to the black void that now engulfs us. The office has vanished. Confusion engulfs my mind, as I struggle to make sense of what is even going on.

I glance around, my surroundings shifting once again, and I find myself transformed back into the form of a Clamperl. Panic and disbelief surge through me, as I grapple with the surreal nature of this realm. The white-haired girl takes a step forward, her aura radiating an otherworldly tranquility. With a gentle motion, she unfurls a singular, angelic wing, and her voice resonates in a tone that seems to carry ancient wisdom.

"Wake up," she utters, her words resonating with a mystical quality that seems to echo. 

I jolt awake, my heart pounding in my chest, as I find myself in an unfamiliar and rustic setting. The makeshift bed beneath me consists of rough hay, and the humble mud hut surrounds me, its clay furniture and simple decor giving it an earthy charm. The air carries the scent of damp earth and the subtle musk of vegetation, blending with the faint aroma of burning wood from a nearby fire pit. Outside, the ground is covered in patches of dead grass and scattered clumps of pulled-apart dirt, bearing the marks of a land that has seen its share of struggle.

As I take in the scene around me, I draw a deep breath to steady myself. "What the hell was that..." I mutter to myself, the words escaping me in a hushed whisper. The remnants of the dream, or whatever it was, linger in my mind, haunting my thoughts like a specter. The image of the white-haired girl, her mysterious presence weighs heavily upon me.

I glance down at my transformed body, once again a Clamperl in this enigmatic Pokémon world. Fear grips me as I grapple with the uncertainty of what that dream may signify, and who that ethereal woman could possibly be. Questions swirl within me, demanding answers that seem just out of reach. Is there a connection between that dream and my existence as a Pokémon? Or is it merely an illusion, a figment of my own imagination?

As I try to gather my bearings in this strange mud hut, a low rumbling sound catches my attention. I turn towards the entrance, and there, standing tall and formidable, the Pokémon known as Ursaring. With a commanding presence, they enter the room, their massive form towering over me. Their dark fur shimmers in the soft light that filters through the cracks in the walls, and their eyes hold both wisdom and warmth.

"Ah, you're awake," Ursaring's voice carries a motherly tone, as if she's seen countless individuals regain consciousness within these walls, a voice I recognize as female.

She begins firing off questions without giving me a chance to respond, her inquisitive nature combining with genuine concern.

"Did you sleep well? Are you feeling any pain? How's your appetite?" Her voice is assertive yet laced with a sense of care, a prying yet protective presence. She invades my personal space touching my shell and my squishy interior.

I take a moment to process her inquiries and touches, realizing that answering at least one question might placate her and allow me to focus on the pressing matters at hand. "I... I slept fine, I guess," I reply, my tone lacking the enthusiasm that usually accompanies polite conversation. However, my own concerns bubble to the surface, overriding the small talk. 

"Where... Where am I? What happened to me?" I blurted out, my voice tinged with a mixture of anxiety and desperation. “I remember…Sentret and Happiny.” I try to remember; I think I went unconscious.

"In Tengentopa Village, dear, a safe haven nestled amidst the wilderness," Ursaring responds, her words laced with a comforting tone. "Sentret and Happiny discovered you washed ashore near the Cape of Wonders. You were in a delicate state, but fear not, I have done my best to tend to your needs."

Her reassurances wash over me, providing a fleeting sense of relief. While my mind continues to race with unanswered questions, I realize that, for now, I must regain my bearings. I can't let myself become overwhelmed by the vast sea of uncertainties. Answers will come in due time, or so I hope.

"So, you are the doctor then, right?" I inquire, attempting to push aside the swirling thoughts in my mind, if only for a moment.

"Yes, dear! I am Ursaring," Ursaring affirms, her voice brimming with pride and dedication. "In Tengentopa Village, I am commonly referred to as Mama Bear, as I care for everyone with earnestness and honor."

As she gently lifts and inspects my shell, assessing its damage, I can't help but feel a glimmer of gratitude towards this caring Pokémon. Despite the overwhelming circumstances that have brought me to this village, I find solace in knowing that there are individuals like Mama Bear, devoted to the well-being of others.

Sentret and Happiny enter the room, their voices filled with animated chatter as they engage in a spirited discussion about Oran Berries.

"Ha! I bet I can carry more Oran Berries than you, Sentret!" Happiny exclaims with a mischievous glint in his eyes. "I've got my trusty pouch, you see! It gives me the advantage."

Sentret's expression twists into a mix of amusement and exasperation.

"Happiny, that's not fair! You can't just stick berries in your pouch and call it carrying. That's cheating!"

Their bickering abruptly ceases as they notice Mama Bear and I awake. With wide eyes, they drop the scattered Oran Berries onto the floor, a sense of guilt washing over them. Mama Bear's dismay is evident, as the precious supply of food for the village is now compromised.

"Oh no! Mama Bear, we're sorry!" Sentret blurts out, her voice tinged with genuine remorse. "We got carried away with our competition and forgot about the importance of our duties." She already assumes back her more orderly stature, more akin to the Sentret I saw back on the beach.

Happiny, his usually cheerful demeanor now clouded with guilt, adds, 
"Yeah, we messed up. We'll make it right, Mama Bear. We promise." Happiny states very much fearful of the current situation.

Mama Bear's stern gaze softens as she sighs, a mix of disappointment and understanding evident in her expression. 

"We'll talk about this later, but for now, let's focus on him. He needs our attention."

Sentret and Happiny approach me cautiously, their concern palpable. Sentret, ever the older sister figure, wears a look of compassionate determination, while Happiny's eyes shimmer with genuine care.

"Hey, how are you feeling?" Sentret inquires, her voice gentle yet assertive. "Do you need anything? Are you in pain?" Again, that question, I almost am annoyed with that question today.

Happiny, his earlier competitive spirit now replaced with genuine worry, adds, "Yeah, we're really sorry about all this. We're here for you. Let us know if there's anything we can do to help."

I take a moment to observe their contrasting personalities, Sentret's calm and dependable nature, and Happiny's lighthearted and caring disposition. Despite their squabbles, it's clear that their hearts are in the right place, their genuine concern for my well-being shining through. I offer a weak smile, grateful for their support.

"I appreciate it, both of you," I reply, my voice filled with gratitude. "Right now, I'm just trying to make sense of everything. The transformation (the dream...), it's a lot to process. But having you here means a lot."

Sentret and Happiny exchange sheepish glances after realizing something.

Sentret's voice carries a hint of amusement as she speaks up, "By the way, we never got your name. Sorry about that."

I pause for a moment, a faint smile tugging at me, regardless of what’s happened today. "No worries. To be fair, I haven't really had a decent chance to introduce myself amidst everything that's happened," I reply, my tone filled with a touch of self-awareness.

Happiny giggles, his eyes twinkling with curiosity. "Well then, spill the beans! What's your name?"

Taking a deep breath, I offer them my name. One that feels odd now, for some reason. "I'm Sterling," I say, the words carrying a sense of identity and familiarity, yet again, wrong…

Both Sentret and Happiny exchange puzzled glances, their voices overlapping as they speak almost in unison. "Sterling? That's... an interesting name. It's a bit unusual, but it strangely fits you," Sentret remarks, her tone a mix of intrigue and playfulness.

Mama Bear, her eyes softening with maternal warmth, interjects gently, "Now, now, Sentret, Happiny, it's not nice to make comments about someone's name or appearance. Everyone is unique in their own way, and we should embrace those differences."

Sentret and Happiny lower their heads, their expressions reflecting a sense of remorse. "You're right, Mama Bear. We didn't mean any harm by it," Sentret concedes, her voice laced with genuine contrition, yet assumes a pose signifying herself to be of a higher standard than her actions.

I offer them an understanding low smile, eager to diffuse any tension. "It's okay, really. I know you didn't mean anything negative by it.”

Mama Bear's eyes sparkle with approval, her voice filled with gentle pride. "That's the spirit, Sterling. Understanding and compassion are key to building a strong bond within our village. Now let’s introduce you to the rest of the Village,

I feel a sense of warmth in my chest, as if this small exchange has further solidified the growing connection between us. In this moment, amidst the uncertainties and challenges, I realize that I'm not alone. I have found companions who, despite their quirks, genuinely care for my well-being. With their support and the guidance of Mama Bear, I feel a flicker of hope reignite within me, propelling me forward on this unpredictable journey. I continue…

In the heart of the Great Canyon, where towering cliffs stretch towards the heavens, a solitary figure perches atop a rocky ledge. Bathed in the golden hues of the setting sun, the mystical Pokémon Xatu stands tall and statuesque. Its slender body is adorned in vibrant plumage of deep blues and rich purples, each feather seemingly aglow with an ethereal shimmer. Its large, almond-shaped eyes are piercing, their irises a mesmerizing shade of crimson, as if reflecting the intensity of the fading light.

Xatu's gaze is fixed upon the horizon, its eyes unwavering as they lock onto the majestic sun, now dipping below the jagged peaks. The wind carries a gentle whisper, caressing the feathers of its outstretched wings, while the distant rumble of flowing water echoes through the canyon depths. As the last rays of sunlight paint the sky in shades of orange and pink, Xatu finally breaks its silence, its voice carrying a tone of ancient wisdom and profound insight.

"So it has begun... The connection," Xatu's words resonate with a mystic power, as if it senses the stirring of forces beyond mortal comprehension.

In this sacred place, where the boundaries of time and space seem to blur, Xatu stands as a sentinel, an observer of the shifting tides of fate. Its presence carries an air of both serenity and anticipation, as if it holds the key to unraveling the enigma that lies ahead. As the sun sinks beneath the horizon, casting the Great Canyon into a veil of twilight, Xatu remains perched atop the ledge, its gaze fixed upon the darkening sky. It knows that the threads of destiny are now woven together, and the journey of Sterling, Sentret, Happiny, and countless others from multiple continents will soon intertwine in ways yet to be revealed. A Meowstic far away awakens from a deep slumber and stares around for a moment he had a momentary dream of an angelic woman saying to "Prepare". He ponders this dream early in the morning as he yawns and gets up and leaves his office.
