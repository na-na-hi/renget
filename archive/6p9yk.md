#Enter, Pikachu!#
[TOC]
#### Prelude 
On the Guild's Outlaw Board, one portrait stood out above the rest for its grisly implications. It had seemingly been there a lot longer than the others, remaining steadfast throughout the constant changes of wanted Pokémon on display. Teams would take the requests, leave, and come back with a criminal in tow in exchange for the valuable bounties thay lay in wait thanks to Magnezone and his team - and yet, this one target had remained, as of yet, untouched, having been covered up by numerous new entries for aspiring heroes to bring to justice.

_"This dangerous Pokémon leads poor Pikachu to their doom - please help us apprehend this criminal at once!"_
**Client**: Magnezone
**Objective**: Arrest Mimikyu!

_Her head ached. How long had she been drifting in and out of consciousness, like she was trapped in some kind of lucid dream? No matter how much she tried again and again to rise up, the weight of her tired body seemed to win out. She hardly even had the strength to lift a finger. Weakly, her eyes opened, unable to fathom anything but blurry shapes and shifting lights. That too, was eventually too painful for her to bear, and once more, she drifted into a slumber; a desperate last-ditch effort from her body to preserve its last bits of strength._

A figure burst into the clearing through a curtain of thick undergrowth, leaving broken leaves and twigs in his wake, and yet leaving no sound as his gait resembled something between a creature scuttling and a phantom gliding. The figure appeared hunched over as he looked around, back and forth, left and right, his 'head' flopping here and there in an almost comically exaggerated manner as he moved, before finally deciding to tentatively approach the crumpled shape that lay limply in the center, staring intently at the bundle of fur. He knew his eyes hadn't deceived him; that yellow flash that fell from the sky was most certainly a Pokémon. He didn't particularly care about the whys or hows a Pikachu had found **itself** falling from the sky; it had most probably been captured by some Staraptor with slippery talons. All that he cared about was the fact that **it** wasn't moving. He grimaced tightly beneath the cloth concealing his features. It seems he was too late to do the job himself - not to mention the fact **it** had not even a single Oran Berry nor Poké to **its** name. Coming out all this way had been an absolute waste of time.
_... Or had it?_

Upon closer inspection, he sees movement. It's shallow, but **its** chest is slowly rising and falling, even if it clearly pains **it** to do so. Excitement began to well up inside of him as **its** body twitches. **It's** _alive._ Beneath the frayed edges of its cloth, tar-black tendrils seep out and coil up into the air like a defensive Arbok, ending off in two twitching and writhing claws aimed right above **its** neck.

"...Mn...hf...? A... Mimikyu?"
_His breath hitches as **it** let out a groggy whimper as **its** eyes flutter open, even if they're glazed over and almost staring into something far beyond him - and yet he knows that those big brown eyes are looking at him with an almost child-like wonder._
He flinches back, frozen in his place as he simply stares at it for a moment, stumbling back a little. _This wasn't supposed to happen. There's no way any Pokémon could wake up from a fall like that!_

"Honestly, I need to lay off the video games, or something... Somethin' like this is way too vivid, even for _my_ dreams... " **it** mumbles absentmindedly out loud, attempting to get **itself** up with some shaky paws, only to stumble back down with a pained squeak.  _What on earth was **it** even talking about? Did **it** really hit **its** head that hard? In all of his time as an outlaw, Mimikyu had never seen **one of them** with such a flat out baffling disposition before as the one before him._

"Ah, um... 'scuse me? You wouldn't mind helping me up, wouldja? I'm... kinda in a pinch, ehehe..." **it** winced, attempting to get to its feet once more. He was snapped out of his daze by the piercing words of the Pikachu right in front of him - _What on earth was he doing? He could get rid of it right here, right now._ Just because **it's** slightly lucid doesn't mean he can't just finish the job. _He's done this numerous times before, so why-_

Pause.

Those eyes. Those big, brown eyes, looking up at him dizzily and relying on him for help. **Its** eyes are full of trust and reliance on some stranger whose intentions **it** didn't even know about yet. Just how delicious would it be to watch the hope in those eyes grow more and more, only to be inevitably crushed in **its** final painful moments? This could be a once in a lifetime opportunity...
_His mouth's watering._
One of his tendrils slinks forth once more, taking the electric type's paw and pulling it up, allowing it to lean upon him for support, something she eagerly does with a sigh of relief.

"A-Are you okay?" He asked, feigning concern in his voice, doing his best to ignore the bile creeping up his throat at having to be so friendly with one of **them.** He had to repeatedly remind himself to be patient. "You look like you took a big fall there... I've never quite seen a Pokémon survive something like that! You're one strong Pikachu!"

"Whuh? Pokémon? Pikachu?! Geez, whaddya talkin' abo... **Eh?**" 
It looked down at its own body, voice trailing off as it stiffened upon the sight of itself. As if it wasn't already convinced by the pain of having fallen from the sky, a single pinch confirmed the most extraordinary. _This was no dream._

_**"YOU'VE GOTTA BE KIDDING MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE....!"**_

#### The Adventure (WIP)
_Dear Diary,
I'm not sure how long it's been since I've come here, but judging by these notes, I'd say it's been two weeks at least since I woke up as a Pikachu. It's been a whirlwhind of a time, that's for sure. Part of me's still convinced I'm stuck in some sort of coma or something, but everything about this place feels so real._

_It's taken me a little while to get used to being a Pokémon and I still don't think I'm all that good at it yet. But with Mimikyu's help, I've really been able to recover and understand things! Honestly, I'm not sure where I'd be without him; he's so nice, and I've learned everything I need to know through him!_

_Today, I recovered enough to finally go into Treasure Town to approach Wigglytuff's Guild. I asked Mimikyu if he wanted to come so we could officially register ourselves as an Exploration Team, but he seemed really nervous at the idea. To be honest, I was too, but I couldn't give up the idea of being able to go explore all these beautiful places, just like in the games!_

_Weirdly enough, when I got there, Chatot was extra suspicious of me. I mean, I know he's always had a bit of a stick up his ass, but this was way scarier! He pressed me and pressed me about where I'd come from, until eventually I crumbled under the pressure and told him the truth - I'd fallen from the sky one day and swore up and down I was a human once before, but now I was more than ready to make my debut into the world of Pokémon™ Mystery Dungeon!_

_I got kicked out immediately._

_I don't know what the hell happened, but apparently this group of aspiring explorers who claimed they were humans came in and left Treasure Town in a complete fucking mess. I even heard a massive part of Apple Woods got entirely destroyed thanks to them! Geez, that's scary... I wouldn't want to run into those types of people, even if they're other humans! They sonund like a whole bunch of trouble..._
_I was really sad at first, but Mimikyu reassured me that we don't need the stupid guild's approval to be explorers. We could just go out on our own! In fact, Mimikyu said he knew the perfect place he wanted to check out with me tomorrow... I can't wait!_

_I'm glad I made a friend so quickly. I miss my family a lot, but I was never good at socialising as a human. I don't feel so lonely with Mimikyu around - I really don't know what I'd do without him! In fact, I've spent the whole evening brainstorming the best team names I can muster. I'm sure with his help, I'll be able to get to the bottom of why I'm here and how I can get back home._

_Yours,
