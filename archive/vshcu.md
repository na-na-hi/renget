Funny, now your phone was mocking you. The charger seemed to have a laugh at you hiding in the drawer it was supposed to be. Then, as you realized, it was on the floor. You connected your phone and sunk into your pillow. Those imbeciles in administration could barely use Excel, let alone move the projects forward. 

"Alright, enough's enough..." You grunt to yourself. No need to drag your office trouble into your bedroom, even if it was all you could think about. You took off your jacket and threw it on top of a chair. Maybe a little nap would help, but no matter how tired your body was, it wouldn't fall asleep. After all, once you woke up, you'd just get in your car and repeat the same mundane day all over again.

Three meek taps on your door ask for your permission to intrude. "Come in..." You growl. Mio opens the door, dressed in her lazy pajamas and an apron. "Yeah...?" You spoke.

"You're gonna miss dinner..."

"Right.. I'll... give me a second, I'll get up..."

"Long day...?" Mio sat at the edge of the bed. 

"Yeah... It's... It's nothing." You mutter. "The usual." Mio then drew her arms around your torso, pulling you into her. Agh, it's so embarrassing. You tried to refuse her, to which she pouted by leaning into you. 

"Come on..." Mio pulled, and too tired to resist, you let her next you in her thighs. You heard a plastic box pop open, and Mio's fingers scratched your scalp. *God, it feels so nice...* "You have to rely on your wife, Anon. You told me the same..."

"I know, but I don't want to burden you with- Ah...~" A q-tip digs into your ear, gentle and caring as only Mio could be. 

"You burden me when you don't let me help you..." Mio pouted, flipping the q-tip and using the other end. "You work like a dog, Anon..."

"... I have to keep this roof over our heads. I have to put food on the table." 

"I'm not saying you don't, I'm just saying that from time to time... Maybe just let go? Just... Relax."

Embarrassed, you turned towards her, her beautiful amber eyes rested atop of a simple, cheeky smile. *Right, the reason you work so hard, it wouldn't be worth it if you ignored her in the process.* Mio's fingers scratch your scalp some more, and bringing your arms around her, you dig yourself into her stomach. 

"N-No, wait-!" Mio yelps, just as you nibble her through her apron. "*Hya!* Come on! You know it gives me the shivers!" 

And that was precisely why you loved doing it. To a kemono, there isn't a greater proof of love than letting their partner near their stomach. Like your troubles melted away, like you're exhaling the tiredness from your body. "... Mio, I love you..."

"*Ha...* What's gotten into you, really?~ Get up."

"... No..."

"Come on, get up~"

Her tone was a dead giveaway. As you sat back on the bed, Mio reached for a hairband and tied her hair in a ponytail. With both hands, she pushed you back on the bed, and on the floor she knelt. 

"I know just how to cheer you up~" 

"M-Mio... Please, there's no need to-" But your paints were already coming undone, and your protests, were met with Mio's cheeky eyes watching your mast shaping up as soon as her hand grabbed it.

"Baby... Mio climbed into bed, landing next to you. There she turned your face towards hers, and with a few kisses, your complaints ceased. "You did your best today, so I'll give you a little reward..."

"You don't have to..."

"*I want to. Is it so wrong to want to make my husband... happy~?*" She whispered into your ear, sending a shiver down your spine. She kissed your neck, she unbuttoned your shirt, and with a kiss marking each of her steps, she lowered herself back into your groin.

Back on the floor, the first thing Mio did was take a whiff of your musk, you tried to dissuade her, telling you you were sweaty, and uncaring, your wife gave you a kiss on your base, making you twitch. A few teasy kisses just to make you let out those impatient grunts. On your base, on your length, on your tip. Mio sucked on the side of your shaft, pulling you with her as she drew backwards, and there she let you go to watch your cock slingshot back into position. 

"Ha..." You grunted. 

"Relax...~" Mio murmured. "Just let me do my thing~"  Her fingers circled around your cock, jerking you at the top. Licking her lips, she took your head in, sucking it gently, and growing more and more famished in her motions as she buried her nose in your pubes. There, your hands clutched the sheets, and even with your entire member shoved into her mouth, you felt Mio's giggles reverberate through your body. Her throat closed your head, and as she drew backwards, she sucked you back in, a wet pop echoing from her lips. 

Prompting yourself up, you gave a glance to that lecherous woman. As she slapped your cock on her cheek, her eyes comforted you with that lecherous shine, that feral lust that Mio only felt for you. Opening her mouth, she let out her tongue and licked your base, lowering herself towards your balls. Your hairs bristle and you exhale as you feel her teeth exert their dominance pulling on one of your balls. Then, covered by her lips, she nibbles and sucks on your scrotum, scratching it with her teeth. Her tongue comes out again and joins in on the fun, giving both of your testicles a glistening shine while her hand moved up and down. Your hand lands at her head, and with your penis covering one of her eyes, Mio looks at you, smiling with your scrotum spilling out of her mouth. 

As she let go, she returned to your penis using her tongue, sliding it from base to tip, and in circles around your head. You grunted and panted, letting your wife hit all of your weak spots that she knew by heart. Then, your head was engulfed by her mouth again, and you recoiled as her cheeks sucked in to tighten her grip on you. Up and down moved her head, making you grit your teeth to hold in your moans. 

"Gome on..." Mio pouted, taking you out of her mouth. "Am I doing good...?"

"O-Of course you-"

"*Then show it.*" She grunted, taking you back inside.

"Ah-!" You grunted, but if that was what she wanted, you had to give it to her. "Oh, Miosha...!" You panted, she giggled. "Suck my dick, suck it more... Take it all in...!"

Obedient, the wolf's tail wags in a happy gesture.

...Right before she plunges down on your shaft, sending it back into her throat. 

"Oh fuck!" You grit your teeth. Up and down she bobbed her head, taking all of your member in one swift motion, and leaving your tip inside before she went back down. Her silky smooth throat was delicious to the touch, and with her cheeks sucked in you were trapped in an airtight vacuum. Mio takes you out, catching her breath, and with the look of a puppy she covered one of her eyes with your dick again. *Oh, you know exactly what that look meant.* You took off your tie and put it around her neck, her cheeks reddening in happiness, her tail wagging to match.

...Just as you pulled, and choked her. 

"Good girl..." You whispered, letting go and standing on your feet.

"Woof, woof!" Mio barked, catching her breath. She took out her tongue and you slapped your cock on it a few times. Mio did as much, rubbing her tongue against your tip as you did. Taking a few steps forward, and with your tip inside her mouth, you trusted and plunged back into Mio's throat.

"Remember... Three taps, okay?" You spoke. Just the safeword. You felt how Mio nodded by the way your cock wriggled inside her.

Thrusting back and forth, you pulled your beloved wolf by her makeshift leash. Her nails squeezed your buttocks, by the way they scratched you, you'd have trouble sitting down, but right now, that didn't matter. You pulled on the tie, tightening it around her neck as your member reached as far as it could. Your hips slammed against her face, and your girl, submissive and obedient, let you use her mouth like an onahole.

"I'm going to cum..." You grunted. "Take it all... Swallow it all!" You let go of the tie, and instead you grabbed Mio's head, holding her in place as you dumped your load into her throat. Looking down your body, you saw her satisfied, happy eyes. Delighted in making you feel well, delighted in servicing the man she loved the most. 

Your cock slid out of her mouth, and first thing she did, was gag a little. 

"Ugh... You were pent up..." Mio snarked.

"Shut... Shut up..." 

"Anon..." Mio stood up, letting you lean on her. Her face was a mess of tears, saliva, and cum, and yet, her eyes gleamed with such an earnest love, you couldn't help but smile. Mio dug into your shoulders, and as you hugged her, she whispered into your ear. "Do your best tomorrow too, okay? I'm rooting for you."

"... Thanks baby..."

"You have to..." Mio panted. "Learn to rely on... to rely on me!" She gasped, almost fainting. "On your cute, adorable... s-sexy..." She blushed.

"... My sexy wife." 

"Y-Yeah..."

She's right. If it wasn't for her, you'd wake up without meaning. She was the reason you got up from bed. She was your taste of homely relief.
