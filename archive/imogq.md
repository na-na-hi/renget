##### `The "Hound" Program`
>worker at a government testing facility
>the site is in charge of developing what they're affectionally calling "hounds"
>an organic replacement for the AI-driven quadruped drones the military
>While their lethality was sufficient, the military wanted something smarter
>something that would do more than just bum rush it's target
>supposedly they'd gotten ahold of werewolf blood to power all this, but that was just a rumor
>so far the project had produced one prototype
>you've been tasked with being a "handler" of this prototype
>you'd only seen her a few years prior
>a bit underwhelming, given she was just a puppy
>either dog years were in play, or there was the possibility the military was about to field child soldiers
>you were at the front of an armored cage with your supervisor
>"Now try not to freak out, we don't know how she reacts to fear"
>how bad could it be?
>they punched a few digits into the nearby keypad and the gate clicked
>slowly the metal shutter rose
>you saw a pair of ebon furred feet
>then muscled shin and thighs
>your expression immediately changed at two things become readily apparent
>One: they were naked
>Two: she was much MUCH taller than you remembered
>the gate was almost halfway up and you could still only see the lower part of her chest
>then out of nowhere, a clawed hand pressed against the underside of the gate and forced it the rest of the way up with a harsh clanging of metal
>before you stepped an 8ft tall wolfess
>even with all the fur, you could see muscles ripple as she moved
>how the hell did they bulk her up this quick?
>"Anon, this is Waya. Waya, this is Anon. He'll be your handler from now on"
>the wolf didn't answer as she looked from the survivor to you
>she took another step towards you, the faint thud of her feet hitting the concrete vibrating through your body
>her piercing eyes silently looked you over

>then without warning, she picked you up for a closer look
>you froze as you were effortlessly brought to her eye level
>getting really hard not to show fear
>the supervisor made no attempt to intervene
>you weren't sure if he knew something you didn't, or was already accepting your fate
>she brought you a bit closer and took a few tentative sniffs
>and then she did something you weren't expecting
>she licked the side of your face
>and then pulled you in for a hug
>you might of appreciated the fact you were currently between her mounds, if it didn't feel like your spine was about to be snapped in half from the squeeze she had on you
>"Well well, looks like she likes you"
"Gruuht," you said from behind the muffling flesh
>"Alright, Waya. Put him down before you break him"
>the pressure was released from your back as she set you down
"Good lord," you muttered
>"Yep, she's still coming to grips with her strength"
>Out of all the things you could have asked, all that came out was-
"Why the hell is she naked?"
>"The boys in R&D are still working on it. The last growth spurt she went through threw off the specs for her armor"
>The wolf just looked between them as he continued
>"Your job is just to make sure she behaves, get her ready for the combat trial next week, and that she doesn't maul anyone between now and then"
>you just nodded, trying to figure out how you were going to keep an 8ft tall meat mountain in check
>"Good luck!"
