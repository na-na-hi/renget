>Backstory
Haiiroshi was born into the family of notable shipyard owners. Of course his stern rich father never loved him and the boy would have to fight to earn daddy's approval.... nah I'm just kidding. His dad looks like the monopoly man but japanese and acts like a big teddy bear. Seeing the potential of his son at a young age, his father aided his training and gently pushed him towards the goal of every child at some point, to be a Hero. The training would cover just about everything a young hero would need to know going into a hero academy.... except public speaking. Haiiroshi struggles talking to  people he doesn't know. That is probably why he will normally keep his helmet on at all times.


Haiiroshi is a calm and collected (usually) young man. He takes his duty very seriously and and will always take the opportunity to help someone . Getting in on recommendations despite his fathers rival being on the board of directors surely was a good sign for things to come. The boy was even informed he was specifically placed in the "prestigious" class 1-f, which is stocked with the "greatest" future heroes.
