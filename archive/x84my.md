>Sunny panting as Kim works some magic with her mouth
>Haha you're so sensitive, Sunny. Never had a girl do this before? 
>Sunny too overwhelmed too respond
>Kim getting really in to it, decides to get brave
>Takes off her pants and climbs on top of him, Sunny's virgin dick is painfully stiff at this point
>Distant thump thump thump
>Kim hesitates, Sunny too out of it to notice
>Hurried footsteps echo through the house
>Sunny, is there someone staying in your house?
>Door is kicked down, Aubrey red faced with fury, bat in hand
>Some time later
>Basil enters Sunny's house, hears a loud discussion between two girls and strange wet noises
>Hurries up to Sunny's room, the source of the noises, and opens the door, jump rope at hand
>Sees both Aubrey and Kim naked, taking turns between fucking Sunny, fighting each other or doing both
>Sunny's like a skeleton, on the verge of death after being used as a piece of meat for how many hours. Basil saw wilted roses with more life than Sunny right now
>The girls don't seem to notice or care, too focused on their fight for Sunny to even see the object of their fight getting his soul sucked dry one orgasms at a time
>It's his death that Basil will need to cover up, unless he does something to save his best friend
>Using strength and power that no one who wasn't Sunny would believe, he immediately hold both of them and tie them up with the jump rope. Compared to carrying Mari this shit's nothing
>He can't even hear their loud protests and name calling, because right now he's breaking the WR for fastest ORS
>After giving it to Sunny, he finally addresses both girls, the fury in his eyes making both of them flinch and stop
>"Kim... Aubrey... you wanted to decide who would be worthy of being with Sunny, but in your fight you both hurt him so much..."
>"Not only you that, you didn't even considered my feelings into this... HOW COULD YOU DO THAT?! That's so mean! So very mean!"
>He composes himself and smiles. Shivers run down in Aubrey and Kim's spines. They knew the final line has been crossed
>"But I'm Sunny's best friend, and know he doesn't want to see you hurt. So I'm going to do a favor to both of you instead!" 
>"I'm going to judge which of of you truly deserves him"
>He then takes off his clothes
>The girl's eyes widen as they see his ripped body and MASSIVE... watering can
>Basil makes a silent prayer to Polly, thanking her for their long nights and for teaching him the ways of brain melting sex. The he approach the girls
>"Don't worry... everything is going to be okay"
>(...)
>Somewhere in the middle of Basil's trial, Sunny is able to regain his consciousnesses and sees his best friend punishing the semen demons who almost killed him 
>Cannot contain the gigantic hard on
>Basil turns and notices that Sunny's awake
>IMMEDIATELY throws Kim of himself and takes his fingers of Aubrey's pussy to rush to his best friend's side
>"S-Sunny! Are you alright?! Do you need water, something to eat? Do you want me to call the hospital? My goodness, I was, so scared! Whn I saw what they did to you, I was so afraid of losing you again... Sunny I-"
>Sunny puts a hand on Basil's cheek
>"Basil... you saved my life. Thank you so much for being by my side all this time. You're truly my best friend"
>Basil can't contain his tears any longer and holds Sunny's hand, not before cleaning it of Aubrey's bitch juices
>"Oh Sunny! I'm...*sniff* I'm so happy! You know I'll always stay by your side, no matter what!" 
>They look in each other eyes for what seems like an eternity, they friendship burning ever brighter
>It was then that Basil notices Sunny's hard on
>"Wow, Sunny! Even after all that you're still standing strong! I cannot even compare..."
>"Basil, you know better than this. I would never be able to punish them like you did"
>"Oh Sunny..."
>"Fu...fucking...nerd...fa-faggots..."
>They both look at Kim trying to get up, but too weak to do so
>This bitch fucking ruined their bro moment
>Sunny and Basil exchange understanding stares. Their friendship is on another level, and so they don't need words to know what the other's feeling
>Basil approaches Kim and lift her up with his hands, like one would do to a baby
>"Now that's a very dirty word that came from your mouth right now. Reducing our friendship to something like that... so as a punishment for this, you're gonna help Sunny recover"
>"What're you talking about, you nerd? I'm no goddamned nurse!" 
>"Oh gosh sweety, we know that. Your role will be somewhat more...crass?"
>Sunny then lifts Kim up, her pussy aligning perfectly with Sunny's raging dick. Sunny smiles seeing her scared face as she's finally understanding what's going to happen 
>"Basil, don-"
>"You're gonna be his onahole"
>Basil then uses all his strength to push her inside Sunny. As Sunny's entire shaft enters her with unholy speeds, she can't help but scream in a mix of pain, fright and pleasure
>"Alright Kim, now move your hips for Sunny! ...Kim? Kiiim? You there?"
>Basil, still holding Kim, hears slurred mumbling and feels by his hands that she's convulsing very, very hard. If he didn't knew better, he would've been calling an ambulance right now thinking she got brain damage. Basil thanks Polly yet again for this knowledge
>"My goodness, you came already? And this hard? Who said you could do that without even satisfying Sunny first?!"
>"I'm soowyy.... dis...dis... soo goood..<3"
>"Your brain melted too? My goodness, am I the only one who even CARES for Sunny at this point?! Well, it's no problem, you don't know Sunny like I do anyway, you would NEVER be able to follow his tempo. Slow then fast, right buddy?"
>Sunny does a thumbs up. Basil really knows him like no one else
>Basil then makes a series of lifts and drops to match Sunny's thrusts. What perfection, what synchronicity! Only true bros would be able to do something like this!
>"aaaaaaaahahahaha <3<3im an onahoooleeee... im cumiing again!!!! again!!!!! again...!!!hehehehe<3<3"
>"Girl, do you ever shut up? Now I understand why you're so close to Aubrey, after some mellowing out you just look like her some years ago. So much for that punk attitude huh?"
>"Basil"
>"Oh! Yes Sunny? Do you need me to push this bitch harder on your cock?"
>"No, Basil. It's time"
>Basil couldn't contain his happiness, after so long... so, so long... they would finally unleash their friendship special
>Basil then lifts Kim yet again, but this time pushes her mouth into Sunny's dick. He then insert his member into her pussy... and there it is. The Faraway Spit-roast is finally complete, ready to shine his glory once again into this world
>Using only the power of their dicks, Sunny and Basil lift Kim. She's now in midair, her mind unable to do anything but feel the tremendous pleasure of this Bro Attack
>After so many synchronous thrusts, they look into each other and know it's finally time to finish this.
>And so, finally they cum, filling Kim completely and leaving her in a pool of semen, once again convulsing madly after THE biggest orgasm of her life. It's a wonder she didn't passed out from the Faraway Spit-roast like so many enemies before. She truly is an amazing gal. 
>Sunny and Basil exchanges looks again. This cannot stand. And so there's no other way besides using...that. The forbidden technique. They shiver at the thought, but there's no other choice
>Basil makes Kim sit down by pulling her hair. Both of them pull their dicks, accumulating enormous elastic force on their members. And then... there's only the thunderous sound of the Double Dick Slap (aka DDS), and then... nothingness. Like the whole world stopped on its tracks in fear of such bro move. An unknowing person hearing that power unleashed would surely think the world has finally come to an end
>Kim, feeling her face being squeezed by the magnitude of this unbreaking friendship, cums hard one more time and finally passes out.
>The enemy who threatened their friendship, the hardest one faced yet, is finally defeated. Looking at a job well done, Basil and Sunny do a high five and hug each other. Their friendship wins again!
>"NO... I WON'T... I WON'T FORGIVE THIS!!!"
>Oh shit oh fuck, they forgot Aubrey. But she definitely didn't forgot them, or what she saw them doing. And so there she is, untied, bat in hand and pure fury in her eyes
>"Aubrey...how-" 
>"SHUT UP! SHUT THE FUCK UP! I DON'T CARE ANYMORE! I'LL BEAT YOU UNTIL THERE'S NOTHING LEFT BUT A BLOODY MESS! I'M GONNA FUCKING KILL YOU BOTH! YOU FIRST FOR DOING THIS TO ME, THEN THAT FUCKING TRAITOR BITCH!"
>Aubrey starts to swing her bat madly, the crashing noises of broken furniture muffled by her rage induced screams. They know that, fueled by anger alone, she will not only destroy Sunny's room, but the whole world if allowed to.
>"Sunny, I promised that I would keep my lips sealed... but if this continues I don't have a choice"
>"I know. Thank you for keeping this for so long, but don't worry, I know it's time. If I don't come back, please, take care of the others"
>Sunny gives one last look at his best friend eyes, makes a prayer to a higher power... and then walks toward the raging Aubrey, knowing fully well if he makes one small misstep, one minor mistake, a cracked skull would be the less
>"SUNNY, GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME! I'LL HURT YOU TOO, I SWEAR I WILL FUCKING DO IT" 
>"Do it, then. Hit me with all you got, if you think that's what I deserve. But you cannot run away from the truth any longer"
>"WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?!"
>Aubrey continues to swing her bat, but Sunny sees she's avoiding him on purpose. Good, there's still hope. He then waits for the perfect opening and when it finally appears... he hugs Aubrey
>"Aubrey... you're hurting, aren't you? You're so hurt by everything that happened today...no, even before. But you don't need to be anymore, because I'm here"
>Silence. Will Sunny feelings get across her broken heart? Will she finally drop her bat and stop her rampage, or will she use this as an opportunity to break his neck?
>More silence. The tension grows, Basil readies himself to do something he will forever regret, but has to in order to save his friend.
>Even more silence. Kim's still passed out, and thank the heavens for that, because even a whimper, a breath from her mouth would cause an unprecedented catastrophe
>.... even the birds and the grasshoppers don't dare to make any noise, afraid that their lives would once again awaken the beast. Or they're merely expectators, too absorbed in the battle to even follow their nature? Only Mother Nature will ever know
>...
>...
>And then, finally... a *thud* makes Sunny and Basil sigh with great relief, and the world became alive
>Or should be, if not for the sobbing noises and tears of a girl, made with such sadness that the world, out of respect for her pain, silenced itself once again
>Sunny hugged her harder, and Aubrey reciprocates, the warmth of their now united bodies giving her the strength to finally say the words hidden in her aching heart
>"I *sob* I just wanted Kim to... *sniff* help me with something, but then she did this to you... *sniff* and when I saw that I was so angry... *sob* I was so angry and scared thinking *sniff* thinking that you would abandon me again that I... *sniff* I...I just wanted to prove that... that-"
>"It wasn't her fault, Aubrey. Kim's your best friend and she loves you very much. It was an unfortunate situation, one that I caused by accident, that made her act like that."
>Sunny then wipes away Aubrey's tears, giving her a simple, yet beautiful smile. 
>"And I would never, NEVER abandon you. Never did, and never will. So you don't need to prove anything to me, you know that, right?"
>His words made Aubrey calm down a little and look at him with eyes that she thought were long gone from her life. But in her heart, the guilt still remains, and so more tears start to appear. Sunny knows the mending of her heart isn't finished yet
>"*sob*But I... But I hurted you today... so much... if Basil didn't appeared... you..."
>"It wasn't on purpose, and what matters is that everything's fine now"
>"I wanted to kill Basil and Kim *sob*... I really, really did... if you didn't calmed me down..."
>"You were just angry. You would never hurt your friends, after all, as you said you stopped for me didn't you?"
>"I trashed your room... destroyed your things..."
>"There's nothing valuable and honestly, you did me a favor, since I was thinking of renovating it anyway"
>Sunny's little joke did wonders to the situation. Aubrey gave a little, cute laugh, but there was still one more thing, one final confession she had to do before they could finally put this battle to rest.
>"I....I....I"
>"Yes, Aubrey?"
>"I....I...I... I JUST WANTED TO SMELL YOUR UNDERPANTS!"
>Finally all the remaining sadness came out, and Aubrey bawled like she was 12 once again.

>Aubrey falls on the ground. He was disgusted at her, she thought. He would leave her like in her worst nightmares! Why she thought telling the truth was a good idea, she was so stupid! So-
>She didn't had the time to finish, as Sunny knelt before her, and showed his hand. each holding one thing. One was his underpants
>"You can smell them anytime"
>And in the other...
>"After all... well..."
>Her panties. And not any panties, her favorite one, with a cute bunny pattern
>Aubrey looked at Sunny, now with a blush on his face, and hugged him so hard both fell to the ground
>In doing so, both noticed an important fact that was forgotten in the middle of the great fight
>They were both naked
>They look at each other, and then Sunny looks at Basil. Their bro link make words unnecessary, as he gives them both a approving smile, puts Kim on his shoulder, and starts to leave his room
>"Basil?"
>"Yes, Sunny?"
>"Bros forever"
>"...Bros forever, Sunny"
>Basil gives a thumbs up to Sunny, and finally leaves the two lovebirds to themselves.
>It's not too long before their lovemaking is heard in the whole house
>"Are you really going back to your house naked like that?"
>"Kim?! You woke up already. I'm impressed, after the DDS it would take you a day minimum to regain consciousness. You really are something else. Do you want me to stop carrying you?"
>"Nah, my legs are still kinda weak. And of course that Double Nerd whatever wouldn't beat me like that, I'm not so weak. Anyway, you're really going to drop me in my house like this? And go to yours butt naked?"
>"Yes. I don't mind it, it's kinda late already so no one would bother. Also we all live pretty close."
>"You're a really strange guy. I still don't believe the flower baby was capable of doing such things"
>"It was for Sunny. You would do the same for Aubrey, wouldn't you? It's the same"
>...
>"Hey, nerd."
">"Yes?"
>"My mom would kill me with that scissors if you drop me like that. So until I can get my clothes back, take me to your house"
>"W-what? R-r-really? Do you... do you want to stay the n-n-ight in my house?"
>"Yeah, is that a problem? It's that or getting my clothes back"
>"Of...of course not! I-it's just that... w-well I don't know if you would li-likeke the couch and..."
>"Don't sweat it. So a girl just needs to pass the night in your house for you to become good old nerd Basil huh?"
>"Not... not any girl...you..."
>Kim turned her face away to hide her blush
>"N...nerd...."

And so, the battle finally ends...
