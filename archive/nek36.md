With a white brush whose tip is dipped in ink
And two azure orbs that fill one with joy
Smiling gaily with lips glossed in pale pink
It's no wonder you're oft described as coy

A single tuft of braided hair, snow-white,
Is all that's needed to stand out, but you
Decided to be like a star at night
Shining bright for all to see and look to

From a name that invokes the winter cold
Your person radiates a friendly warmth
Which reminds me of a lost loved one's hold
On a cold night huddled around cheap cloth

Fubuki although we will never meet
Thank you for being a friend to a NEET.
