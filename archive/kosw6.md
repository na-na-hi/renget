>unconsciously start ramming his ass to the music
>Threatens to rip out your spleen but he just came so hard his legs went numb

>He's rightfully nervous when you're invited to meet his extended family.
>His mother, father, several brothers and sisters (each!) and his beloved nonna are all going to be there.
>You've heard his exasperated conversations with them over the phone before, for example:
>"No Mama, MAMA, NO I LOVE HIM MAMA...YES HE BROKE THE PASTA BUT HE'S A GOOD GUY!"
>"N-No don't put Papa... Hi Papa... Yes... No... No... Yeah mixed with chicken... non parla italiano... Sì, un essere umano.. Aww PA HE'S A GOOD GUUUUY"

>Arrive for dinner
>Hardly have time to take off your coat and shake hands before you're yoinked into the kitchen and given an impromptu lesson in italian cooking
>His parents are all business, you can see they clearly believe educating you is necessary for the survival of you and their son

>After learning some pretty interesting stuff, you feel like you could do a whole meal up for your bf and not have him freak out.
>However, that'd mean you'd lose the opportunity for some amazing angry sex, plus you found him absolutely adorable when he was all flustered
>Things calm down after dinner and everyone's settling in. You take a seat next to your bf
>He pours you out some red wine and asks if you were ok, he couldn't come into the kitchen because nonna said the facebook was broken again.
>You brush it off and tell him you had a lot of fun.
>You then immediately reach for the ice bucket that the white wine is cooling in and pick up a cube.
>"wh-what're you...No...NO THAT'S A RED WINE STOP!"
>You casually resist his attempts to bat the ice cube in your hand away from the wine, while you casually asks if his mom knows how to make gnocchi
>He looks like he wants to die when you pronounce it "guh no chi"
>He can't wrestle your hand away as the ice cube gets closer and closer to the wine glass.
>So he takes you by surprise and envelops your entire hand in his mouth.
>He grips your wrist like a vise and is refusing to let go until the ice is totally melted.
>It's surprisingly erotic, having him suckle on your fingers like this, and you're frankly stunned for a moment.
>...and then the door swings open
>"Hey bro have you seen th-WOAH NEVERMIND I'LL COME BACK LATER"

Oh fuck.
>A couple days later, you go back over to his parent's place
>you went to the store and got some canned tomatoes, a bag of shredded mozzerella cheese, and a few different jars of tomato sauce
>on the way there your bf begs you not to piss off his parents
>you say "yeah okay, sure" and walk in
>they look at you kinda funny about the wine thing and brush it off
>you say hi and put your bag down in the kitchen, hoping they wouldn't notice
>you all seem to have a good time, but then you see your bf's parents get up to go get everyone more drinks
>you wink at your bf, and he looks at you kind of strange
>20 seconds later you hear a scream from the kitchen and your bf's eyes widen
>"WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?!"
>Your bf closes his eyes and pinches his nose
>A few moments later that bag of shredded cheese you got flies towards your bf and tears open, spilling cheese everywhere
>"PRE-SHREDDED CHEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH"
>Your bf's mom stormed outside holding a can of tomatoes you bought, actual hatred on her face. 
>You never thought you would see your bf this shooken
>"CANNED. FUCKING. TOMATOES?!"
>He sighs and starts talking "Hey look, I can explai-" before she starts screaming something in Italian
>His ears perk up and he starts arguing back
>Pretty soon all 3 of them are screaming in Italian while his brother watches

>Things escalate as you catch enough words to make a barebones translation
>According to his parents, you were a "devil who grabs good food by the hair and violently *something*s it"
>Your boyfriend replied that he "didn't care that you tried to put ketchup on broken up spaghetti, you were a good man and he would do all the cooking" aww, he was totally getting some road head on the way home for that
>One of his brothers chimed in, asking how he was gonna work full shifts at the garage and cook for two
>"I-I'LL DO MEAL PLANNING ON SUNDAY"
>"YOU GONNA TAKE ALL OF THE SABBATH TO MAKE FOOD THAT'LL BE STALE ON A FRIDAY?!"
>"IT'S IN TUPPERWARE YOU DUMB FUCK IT WON'T GO STALE"
>As the argument ramped up again, you realized this was probably from everyone refusing to touch the food, wolves were the worst when they got hangry
>Well, as much fun as torturing your BF was, you should probably stop him from having to elope with you.
>Nonna was the only one who seemed totally unperturbed by the drama, she complimented your chicken parm!
>You asked her if she could help you out with something real quick while everyone "talked things out"
>She followed, warning you that Umberto (your bf's dad) was going to get his baseball bat if you pulled any more stunts.
>You smiled reassuringly before handing her your business card. Her eyes were like dinner plates as you casually asked if she had any heavy cream on hand
>Judging by the volume of the argument inside, you had a couple hours to get things going and stop a feud.
>Nonna was more than on board, she was surprisingly spry for a woman in her late 70's as she happily took the role of sous-chef on
>See, you had been dating your bf for quite some time, but the subject of your career wasn't really discussed, you loved him, which is all he needed
>Plus, telling him you were the head baker of "Cerise", the most well known bakery in the city would have made messing with them way less funny
>Anon specializes in French high complexity artisanal baking, lots of refined and hard to acquire products make him used to being weird and improvising with food
>After long shifts of constantly making complex and demanding cakes, tarts, breads and soufflés, sometimes you just wanna throw whatever is in the fridge together and make a tasty mess
>You had elected to temporarily throw away this devil-may-care cooking style to bring peace back to this home.
>Like a pro-sports player, you activated your inner switch, resetting your mind and entering "baker" mode 
>To the outward observer (nonna in this case) the very air around you changed. Gone was the handsome and culinarily misguided human. Replaced with an apex predator of the cooking world
>To cook is to follow your sense of taste, but to bake is to know exactly how to construct your food in the most ideal form with laser precision.
>Normally you'd elect one of your specialty French dishes, but since time was of the essence, you needed to make it quick and Italian.
>It took you thirty seconds of prep-time and browsing to decide what to make, a Tiramisu
>Nonna would give your team at work a run for their money, she seemed more than happy to casually chat with you and innocently try to get as many secrets from you as possible, while keeping up with you like a pro
>You finished well behind schedule, sharing a coffee and explaining how you liked to use a little almond oil to nonna as you let it set.
>Your baker's sense of timing was right on the dot. Your bf burst through the door, red faced and muttering under his breath
>"Anon, we are leaving"
>"Babe, go sit at the table with your parents"
>"ANON I-"
>"TABLE. PARENTS. NOW."
>Looking absolutely bewildered at your sudden sharpness, he quietly retreated
>It was a little too early for your liking, but the cream held it's shape as you brought it out for the judging, passable.'
>Everyone was in various states of dishevelment from the argument.
>Hackles were up and teeth were bared as you carefully placed the dish on the table
>Eyes rolled as they realized that *you* made this. Though you had some curious sniffers on your side
>Retrieving a spoon and your business card. You uncovered the Tiramisu, naturally it was almost flawless.
>Now their ears were perked.
>With a smile you flicked your card down the table towards your bf's parent's.
>As they read the embossed card (eggshell with romalian type), You carefully cut up a some samples and served it around with Nonna's help
>They seemed reluctant, suspicious even, but the parents were doing a shot-for-shot replay of Nonna's reaction as they finally realized that this was your business card
>They dug in without hesitation, and the others soon followed suit.
>Their fur stood on end as they experienced what a seasoned baker going all out could do.
>They were like pups as their own instincts and hunger betrayed any pride they might have had. 
>There were delighted hums, approving nods, and the tension in the air melted away with the flavors of sweet cream and coffee
>Though naturally, someone had to ask the burning question.
>"If you're a professional baker in such a classy place like that, why did you make such hobo food before?" Ouch...
>You explained that being in baker mode all the time was exhausting, and that the way your bf's tail bushed up when he was mad was the cutest thing ever. (You omitted the part where angry sex was just plain amazing)
>Your bf looked ready to kill you as they joked about how he used to be called "coda crespa" from how all the fur got knotted up from him doing that.
>You were definitely ending tonight with bite marks all over you and demands for a week's worth of cannoli after dessert.
>Totally worth it.
