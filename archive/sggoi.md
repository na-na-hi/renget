## Day 1 - Maid Shiori

>It started with a simple joke
>"I bet you're unable to play the role of a maid, Shiori"
>She pouted at you and responded, her tone somewhat arrogant, as if she intended to prove you wrong: "Hmph! You're going to eat those words Anon! I'll be the perfect maid and I'll have you bowing before me as my butler afterwards!"
>A week later, as you arrive home from work
>You wonder how you managed to survive such a hellish work day while opening the door
>Then, Shiori greets you
>"Welcome home Master, normally I'd ask if you want a dinner, a bath, or me, but since I'm just a maid and not a housewife, the best I can offer you is dinner."
>Shiori smirks at you, fully into the role of a maid
>You feel a sense of heat rise up from within you.
>You approach her, playfully holding her against the wall, then you tilt her head up to face you by resting your fingers under her chin
>"I think I'll have you anyway." You say to her, a look of desire in your eyes.
>Shiori smirks again then playfully slaps your cheek and responds to your advances: "Pfft, you're not allowed to touch me until you admit that I'm a great maid!"
>You sigh then decide to ask for dinner
>This is unfortunately where disaster strikes
>Shiori brings you a bowl, in it is a bowl of instant ramen she made, with a few extra toppings, a sunny-side up egg, some chopped spring onion, shallots and some bits of chopped fried chicken.
>It looks appealing in all aspects, you have to admit that for instant ramen, Shiori managed to make it look good
>And then, she trips, the entire bowl falling out of her hand and landing on the floor
>You watch the entire thing happen from your chair, a desire to laugh is building up but you quickly cover your mouth, trying your hardest not to let a sound out
>"OH FUCK! SHIT! HOLD UP THAT WASN'T MEANT TO HAPPEN!"
>Shiori's impressive maid roleplay has already shattered, her clumsiness cannot be masked by mere roleplay.
>Thankfully the bowl hasn't shattered from the fall, the contents were just spilled out everywhere
>You sigh and proceed to get up but Shiori quickly stops you, placing her hands on your shoulders and forcing you to sit back down.
>"Ano-err, Master, please sit and wait, I got this!"
>Shiori tries to sweep up the mess as fast as she can, using a dustpan and broom.
>She sighs then goes back to the kitchen.
>From the kitchen, you can hear her exclaim: "I spent hours practicing gosh darn it!"
>Soon after, she returns with another bowl, this time it's just some cereal with milk, it doesn't look as appetizing as the first meal, sadly.
>Shiori, trying to look as refined as she could, places the bowl in front of you.
>"Here, it may not be the best, but it should be good for now!"
>You look at the bowl of cereal, an understanding smile on your face, but then you realize something important
>"Hey Shiori? Where's the spoon?"
>She looks at you confused: "Huh? Spoon? What spoon?
>You then point to the bowl of cereal, making it clear that you can't eat without a spoon
>She stares at you for a few seconds, her cheeks, and then her ears, slowly turning red.
>She runs back to the kitchen, then runs back to you with a spoon
>"H-here! Take it! Frick!" She drops the spoon in front of you
>You look at her, unable to hold it in any longer, you start laughing
>"Sh-shut up! Eat your god damn cereal!" her cheeks are fully flushed red now, embarrassed and unable to look at you properly.
>She then storms off, exclaiming out loud: "I'm going to prepare the bath for you, it'll be ready by the time you're done!"
>It's clear she's trying to avoid further embarrassment so you leave her be and begin to eat the cereal
>It's about as plain as it looks, just cereal, no fruit or anything to accompany it.
>After finishing the sad excuse of a dinner meal, you at least think that the bath will be ok.
>You leave your bowl at the sink, making sure to rinse it with hot water first, then you head to the bathroom.
>Shiori is still there, bent over, testing the water repeatedly to make sure the temperature is just right for you
>Her skirt is lifted up as she's bent over, you can see her panties pretty easily.
>You're tempted to go for a cheeky feel, but you know that the more you hold back, the better it will be after.
>Shiori, satisfied with the water, wipes her forehead then proceeds to turn around.
>Unfortunately, she didn't expect you to be there so quickly
>With an audible "Eek!" she steps backwards and falls backwards
>You're too late to catch her, and she falls into the bathtub
>Her entire outfit now soaked, you even notice her panties are practically see-through.
>She looks up at you, as if she's about to cry
>"D-don't look! Fuck!"

## Day 2 - Bunny Shiori

>Ever seen a bunny wear a leash?
>It started as an innocent dare
>"Anon, I bet you can't take the lead for even one day."
>You accept the dare, and now you've found yourselves in a rather, heated, situation.
>However it isn't the bad kind of heated, rather it feels pretty good.
>You didn't really have the 'equipment' for anything more 'advanced'
>The best you could do was a pair of handcuffs, a dog collar and leash, and a sleeping mask to be used as a blindfold and some metal chains.
>That was more than enough for this 'dare' however.
>Shiori has her hands cuffed together, the metal chains used to suspend her arms in the air, holding the cuffs in place.
>The sleeping mask now covering her eyes, she can't see through them at all.
>She's reduced to just her bra, panties and her stockings, which you've had fun tearing apart.
>Just for a bit of added fun, she's wearing a bunny ear headband right now.
>She tries to call for you, her tone carrying a hint of embarrassment: "Anon..Th-this is a bit..much, isn't it?"
>You get behind her, gently caressing her cheek with your right hand and thumb, running it along her lip too.
>Her response is to your liking, the inability to see means that she can feel a lot more.
>Your touch is enough to make her shiver, and she begins to breathe heavier.
>You rest your thumb against her lips, and she gently opens her mouth
>Saliva dripping from her mouth, she cups her lips around your thumb, lightly sucking on it.
>You breathe down her neck as she suckles on your thumb. She can only shiver from the heat of your breath, along with the sounds of whimpering.
>Your patience is slowly leaving you. You want nothing more than to take your penis and plunge it in her helpless body
>You resist the temptation for now, choosing to indulge in this play a little longer.
>You take your right hand away, you can almost imagine the disappointment in her face from having your hand leave her, as she tries to search for it blindly.
>Under her breath, you hear her utter: "W-why?" as if she were scared that you were already done and bored with her
>You take your right hand, and gently rest your fingers, one by one, onto her throat.
>She lets out an excited gasp, feeling glad that you weren't finished yet.
>A smile on your face appears, you're fully immersed in this opportunity you've been given
>As you hold her throat, being sure not to strangle her, you press your lips against her shoulder, kissing into it.
>The pleasure of your lips on her shoulder leaves her beginning to breathe out more, you holding her throat makes it a little harder, but that only adds to her enjoyment.
>As you continue to kiss into her shoulder, you feel that you should add a little bit of pain to it, and you open your mouth and begin to bite down into her shoulder
>An audible moan escapes Shiori's lips, followed by her crying out for you: "A-anon."
>She follows up with something you didn't expect, but perhaps this 'dare' of yours has begun to open up her masochistic tendencies, as she simply says: "More."
>You pull your head back, and then you bite down into her other shoulder, harder.
>Finally your left hand decides to take action, you avoid her breasts, and her now sopping wet vagina, and instead target her lower abdomen.
>Your left hand begins to massage her there.
>She begins shaking almost uncontrollably.
>"Ohhh! Frick!" she exclaims out loud, getting more turned on by the second as you assault her with your left hand and your teeth.
>Your right hand lets go of her throat, now grasping onto her hip to stabilize her body a little.
>Minutes pass, you've yet to let up with your hands, with only your head pulling back, only to kiss the back of her neck.
>Finally, she says it, in a tone that carries both lust and desire
>"Oh good golly, anon, I can't take this a-anymore. Just hurry up and fuck me."
>Your smile, now turns into a smirk, you slowly lick your lips, then you take the dog collar and leash from earlier.
>You let go of her entirely, stepping in front of her, you gently put the collar on her, with the leash in hand, you tug at it a couple times.
>Shiori's head is forced to move along with your tugging, as her neck is pulled towards you.
>Shiori, sensing that you're in front of her, looks up at you, even though she can't see you through the sleeping mask blindfold
>With that, she gives you a sultry smile.
>"H-hurry Anon."

## Day 3 - Mermaid Shiori

>Shiori enters her library, with you slowly following behind her
>Her pace is fast, determined, with a goal in mind.
>After passing through many bookshelves, the two of you arrive at a single lone book on a pedestal, there is no image on the cover.
>There she gently lifts the book, dusting it off a little and blowing on it, then she walks back
>You follow her the entire way until the two of you arrive back at her chambers where she resides
>You sit on the edge of the bed, with her sitting next to you, she then smiles at you and says: "This will be quite a story, come, rest your head too."
>With the invitation given, you rest your head on her lap, now fully comfortable.
>She takes the book from earlier, and opens the book
>There she begins to read to you, a story of a mermaid, and suddenly your eyes close, as if under a magical spell
>Shortly after, you open your eyes and now you're floating over a vast ocean.
>You feel your body being dragged into the water, however you do not feel wet as your body plunges in, you do not feel a sense of drowning.
>Another adventure. This isn't the first time you've 'entered' a story with Shiori.
>As your body is guided through the ocean, you take in many sights, schools of fish swimming, vibrant in colour. Turtles and jellyfish, even a few crabs scuttling along the sea floor.
>This place is not any real location you can think of in the world, it's merely a fantasy recreated from Shiori's words.
>After some time you arrive at what appears to be an underwater town, there you see all kinds of 'people' from turtles walking on two legs, to fishmen with human bodies and fish heads. There's even a lady with octopus-like features.
>Your body seems to have regained its own freedom of movement, this underwater town is now free to explore
>You already know where it is you have to go though.
>You walk towards an underwater house that's further away from the rest, basically on the outskirts.
>You knock on the door and are greeted with a familiar sight, well 'familiar' in a sense.
>Shiori happily greets you, but she seems to be in the form of a mermaid
>"What took you so long anon? Were you enjoying the sights?"
>You respond somewhat sarcastically: "Please, you make it sound like I can move on my own before I arrive."
>Shiori looks at her own tail then begins to swim around, commenting on how she feels the tail is a little tacky.
>The two of you then exit the little house and begin exploring the underwater world together
>She swims alongside you as you walk
>The two of you eventually run into the wreckage of a pirate ship that had sunk to the ocean floor
>A spark of excitement overcomes the two of you and you both spend the time rummaging through the wreckage.
>A few gold bars, a waterlogged diary and the remains of a flag that seemed to once bear a symbol, but had been torn apart
>Shiori takes hold of the diary and says a few words, before long the words that were once written on the diary flash before the two of you.
>You also see the last moments of the diary holder, dying as another pirate ship had attacked them.
>Satisfied with the visions, the two of you begin to return to mermaid Shiori's little home.
>Upon arrival, she gently puts her arms around you
>"Was it satisfying? Exploring under water with me?"
>You smile and respond, however your tone has a tinge of sarcasm on it: "It was really fun, thanks to you I didn't even drown, but it woulda been nice if I had a little mouth-to-mouth."
>Shiori kisses you softly on the lips and responds with equal sarcasm: "Fine, mwah. Happy?"
>You smile again and then look outside of the window while holding her.
>Despite being entirely submerged underwater, the view is pretty nice, you can even see coral reefs in the distance.
>A few moments pass and Shiori finally says something to break the silence
>"Hmm? I guess today's adventure is nearing its end, I guess it's time for you to return?"
>You look at her, a slight pang of sadness hits you, as the adventure is coming to a close, however this isn't your only adventure, there will be plenty more to come.
>You gaze at Shiori in her mermaid form one more time, taking in the image and burning it into your brain.
>She looks unexpectedly shy from this, she turns away and tells you: "Hey, c'mon Anon, that's embarrassing."
>However she eventually resigns herself to your gaze and gives up protesting.
>Satisfied with the memory you've obtained, the idea of Shiori as a mermaid, you gently close your eyes again and Shiori begins to hum.
>Suddenly there's complete silence, the humming you heard just a few moments ago is completely gone
>As you open your eyes, you find yourself back, your head on Shiori's lap, you've returned to her bed chambers.
>"How was it Anon? Did you enjoy seeing me as a mermaid?"
>She begins to run her fingers through your hair gently, as you recount the little adventure to her.
>The book she had earlier now has an image of you and Mermaid Shiori on the cover.

## Day 4 - Kemomimi Shiori

>You've been living with your imouto for a while, your imouto Shiori.
>You don't know why, but at some point she had developed cat ears, though she tends to hide them.
>Shiori's feeling really lazy today, she hasn't even gotten out of bed yet.
>While it is technically her day off, she should still at least be getting up, getting some exercise in and eating
>You look at her, signs of worry are plastered on your face.
>She looks back at you with an innocent smile on her face
>Your little staring contest continues for a while longer before you finally give up
>You sigh at her then say: "Fine, you can be lazy today I guess. I'll make food for you."
>She cheers happily, knowing that she's been given the ok to be as lazy as she wants, but then an idea forms in her head
>"Oh, I know!" she exclaims, before you leave the room
>She reveals her pair of cat ears and puts them on, she has a black ear for the left side of her head, and a white ear for the right. It matches her two-tone hair colour well.
>Then she looks at you and gives you the cutest "Meow~" she could give.
>Your heart is instantly struck. No way, no way she's that cute, you stand no chance if she keeps this up."
>"Hehe, today I'm not Shiori Novella, I'm Shiori Nyavella! You get to be my owner for today!"
>Normally, the word "owner" would imply things, very erotic, sexual things, but with the way she's acting right now, the cuteness is overwhelming you.
>To get yourself to calm down, you head to the kitchen and begin preparing breakfast, checking through the pantry you notice there's some ingredients for pancakes.
>You also check the fridge and take note of some blueberries that you can use for pancakes
>Shiori follows you to the kitchen, yawning lazily as she sits on a chair at the kitchen counter
>"Nyaaa..what's onii-san making for me?"
>You turn around in surprise, looking at her face, an innocent cat-like smile is on her lips
>You quickly turn back around, facing away from her, even 5 minutes of looking at her like that may be enough to ruin you
>You begin to calm yourself down and you start making the pancakes, you try to casually ask her: "What do you want for your pancakes."
>Without even looking at her, you can already tell there's a cheeky grin on her face, just based on how she answers you
>"I want Onii-san's special pancakes!"
>You think to yourself for just a moment: "What the actual fuck does she mean?" but you quickly shake your head
>After a short while passes and the pancakes are done. You present to her a 4-stack pancake tower, strawberries line the sides, ice cream on the top, nuttella inbetween each layer, some whipped cream in front and maple syrup oozing down between each layer.
>She stares at it in awe and begins to eat it
>You can almost see her ears twitching in delight as she eats the pancakes without a care in the world.
>"Nyaa..it's too good onii-san, I'm in heaven..."
>If you didn't know any better, that line was intended to get you turned on, however you close your eyes and offer back a simple smile instead.
>Your imouto's lazy day has only just begun, but you wonder if you'll be able to handle a full day of Shiori Nyavella with no restraints.

## Day 5 - Elf Shiori

>You're the fabled and feared Demon lord.
>You sit upon your throne, bored of the life you've lived
>Honestly, you just want to retire from being the demon lord and spend your time playing games and wasting time watching stuff on the internet.
>But being the demon lord doesn't allow you to do that
>You have to be a mean, imposing ruler that tries to stop the hero
>It's so boring, the hero is always too weak and dies in 1 or 2 attacks, sometimes even your minions kill the hero
>One day, your boring life is changed as your minions return, dragging a cage
>In the cage is an elf girl
>You sigh heavily and order all your minions away, then you adjust your voice to sound deeper, more intimidating
>"Ahem, mmm, ok, this is good."
>The elf girl looks at you, you can see fear in her eyes instantly
>After making sure your voice sounds good, you speak to her, trying to maintain an intimidating yet composed tone: "What is your name, elf, speak."
>She timidly replies to you: "I-I'm Shiori Novella..what are you going to do to me?"
>You playfully repeat her name, then you look at her and declare: "I'm going to...let you go."
>She looks at you for a moment, blankly, as if she didn't hear you right.
>You continue to ramble on: "Look, I'm tired of being the demon lord, I just want to relax and enjoy the rest of my life, and you look like you were at the wrong place at the wrong time so just sneak out the back ok?"
>She continues to stare at you blankly, then she starts accusing you of being a liar and questioning you
>"Liar! Y-You're going to rape me aren't you?! You're going to plant your demonic seed in me and make me give birth to your next of kin! Over and over!"
>You blush instantly and look at her in utter disbelief: "What the fuck are you saying woman?!"
>She doubles down, adamantly, firmly believing the things she's saying
>"I've heard all about it! You kidnap women and rape them, make them give birth to your demonic spawn then eat them after! My mom told me about it!"
>You can feel second-hand embarrassment from all the wild accusations being thrown at you, and decide that the best way to prove you aren't going to do anything is to just free her.
>You swing your arm, a simple motion, and the cage instantly slices apart, Shiori unharmed.
>"I knew it! You're going to come in this cage and abuse me like a wild animal!"
>You've finally had enough and you yell at her slightly: "No, you dumb woman, and your mother is dumb too! Just step out and leave already!"
>You sit back down on your throne, closing your eyes, all the wild accusations has left you too exhausted to bother
>Shiori stands there, minutes pass, then an hour passes, and another hour passes.
>Finally, after awkwardly standing there just staring at you, she finally asks: "You're really not going to rape me?"
>"No." you reply, without bothering to open your eyes
>Suddenly you hear her stomach rumble, have your minions even been feeding her properly?
>You open a single eye and look at her, before asking just to be sure: "That was you wasn't it?"
>She looks away embarrassed, and then nods slowly.
>"How does an elf even get captured and then starved, ok what do you eat?" You ask her sarcastically.
>She tries to talk back: "I just let my guard down that's all!"
>You click your fingers and a strange creature wearing a chef hat appears
>She looks at it, scared for a moment, before you tell the creature: "Prepare us some food."
>As it leaves, she looks a little more relieved.
>You click your fingers again and a rather long table appears before her
>You sit down at one end of the table, and the chef creature returns with various dishes.
>Steak, chicken, fish, various salads, fresh fruit and even some soups are lined along the table.
>You motion towards a chair and Shiori decides to sit.
>"You..you're not just buttering me up to have sex later right?" She asks nervously, was all she taught that demons are sex pests or something?
>You decide to not even entertain the question anymore and begin to slowly eat.
>She nervously reaches for some food and begins to eat and instantly blushes: "Wait..this is better than the food I ate back in the hero's party!"
>She begins to eat without restraint, it even looks kind of cute after a while.
>Finally she asks: "Why are you doing this?" her mouth somewhat full of food as she asks
>You look at her and answer half-heartedly: "Demons aren't all that bad, and I'm bored of being the demon lord, that's all."
>Shiori then looks at you, as if her whole world has been a lie and that some demons can be kind, however she still feels somewhat wary of you.
>Lastly, you sigh, having given up on getting rid of her easily.

***

## Day 6 - Vampire Shiori

>It's been a month since the day Shiori used you for her own sexual relief.
>Ever since that night, you would frequently wonder what happened.
>Shiori has never mentioned it since, treating you as she usually does, being sure to punish you if you're late by even a second, and otherwise demanding things of you such as food, a massage for her stiff shoulders, or your blood as a smoothie.
>At some point you even begin to wonder if it were a dream you had.
>However, the bite marks on your wrist and hands prove otherwise, it happened, it was very real.
>Today seems like no other, you hear the bell ring, calling for you.
>You immediately stop what you're doing and head towards Shiori's room.
>You knock twice, and after a couple moments a monotone: "Enter." is heard from the other side of the door.
>Shiori is sitting on the side of her bed, cross legged, wearing nothing but a long shirt, it's open, the sides cover her breasts and nipples perfectly.
>Her legs, stomach and chest are all exposed, the moonlight shining in from the window only accentuates her pristine skin.
>You're completely frozen in place, almost as if a spell were cast on you, but it was no spell that caught you, in fact it was her unparalleled beauty.
>Shiori stares at you, her face turning from a blank stare, to a dissatisfied look, but what is she dissatisfied about?
>You notice the look on her face and try to speak, but no words come out
>She sighs then gets up and walks towards you, her footsteps produce no sound, her eyes stare into yours
>She grabs you by your tie and pulls you in
>"Most men would already be on their knees, kissing my feet, but you, all you can do is stand there, are you that useless?"
>The tone of her voice is somewhat disappointed, it's degrading even, however an amused smile appears on her face and she says: "Well, it's not that bad, most animals that move on the first opportunity would be put down by me. You at least have some patience."
>She presses her sharp fingernail against your suit, tearing into it: "Don't worry, I'll get you a new one." she playfully mentions as she's tearing your clothes apart.
>Once you're reduced to nothing but your underwear, she directs you to sit against the bed frame.
>Your body automatically follows and does as it's told, whether or not you have control of your own body right now is a mystery to you.
>There, she stands over you, her vagina in front of your face, she rests both of her hands on the top of your head.
>"Are you a dog? Or perhaps a monkey? Because you certainly aren't a human."
>She muses as she stands in front of you, you're completely mesmerized in her body.
>"Well, I guess I'll let you play your part. I hope you know how to use your tongue better than a dog."
>She presses against your mouth, and slowly you begin working your tongue.
>You slowly taste her, letting your tongue explore her vagina. You hear her heavy breathing and a slight moan that sounded like it tried to be held back.
>A few minutes pass before she takes a step back.
>"No. Not enough." she utters under her breath. Was your tongue not enough? Did you disappoint her again?
>She drags her finger nail along your underwear, tearing it also and then tossing it aside.
>"You're at full attention tonight huh? Yet somehow you still manage to be late when attending to me on other days."
>She playfully drags her fingertip along the shaft of your penis, if she used her fingernail it would be all over, your manhood would be sliced in an instant.
>She's careful, gentle, making sure not to slip up. Her hair is covering parts of her face, but you make out a rather mischievous smile.
>She looks up at you and says: "I think you're ready, hopefully at least this will be satisfying."
>She lowers her hips over your penis, all it would take is a simple plunge down and your entire penis would be eaten up by her vagina in one go.
>However, instead she sinks her teeth into your shoulder.
>A sharp pain instantly takes you, you try to express the pain but for some reason no sound comes out of your mouth.
>You can feel warm blood oozing out of your shoulder, along with her wet tongue dragging along, lapping up the blood.
>The next thing that happens takes you by complete surprise.
>She pulls her head back, her tongue still covered in your blood, then she proceeds to kiss you, the intensity is more than you've ever experienced, your tongues are dancing against each other, sharing in your own blood with her.
>At the same time, the feeling you've been waiting for happens, she lowers her hips, your penis now entering her vagina, being squeezed in every direction by her walls, wet and sticky.
>In-between kisses she orders you: "Move your hips, surely you'll do better than a monkey."
>You immediately listen to her, thrusting your hips upwards, waves of pleasure are sent directly to your brain as you feel it throughout your entire body.
>You gaze into her eyes as the intense kiss the two of you are sharing continues, the metallic taste of your own blood is coated by the sweet taste of her saliva.
>Her eyes portray a hint of satisfaction, a hint of lust, and a hint of desire for more.
>Suddenly your body stops all movement, you can move your hips no longer.
>That's when she pulls her head back, breaking the kiss the two of you shared, and you see her grin.
>"Oh dear, what's wrong? Am I not enough?" she says playfully, taunting you on your inability to move.
>It finally becomes clear, your inability to speak, your involuntary movements and lack of, they were all her doing from the beginning.
>"Very well, I suppose I must do all the work."
>Another sharp pain takes you on your forearm, however this causes your penis to twitch, something she easily takes notice of as she felt it from the movements in her vagina.
>"Oh? Butler, are you perhaps a masochist?"
>She looks at you with a slight hint of amusement as she asks that question, however you cannot answer her right now.
>She drags her tongue along your forearm, lapping up any blood that drips down, at the same time she proceeds to move her hips.
>Grinding in circular motions, dragging herself along the shape of your penis, you quickly feel yourself reaching your limit, as your penis begins throbbing.
>The blood loss is again beginning to affect you, you feel light headed, your eyelids are beginning to close, but then she whispers something in your ear that forces them open.
>"Don't pass out this time butler, or you may not wake up again."
>Her command sounds ominous, as if implying that if you were to pass out now, you may never wake up again, perhaps she'll even throw you out and abandon you.
>For some reason, the threat of not being able to wake up tomorrow only adds to her excitement.
>With a rather lengthy moan, you feel her body shuddering over yours, her vagina now squeezing down, milking you for everything you've got.
>Your penis reacts to the tight squeeze and you can no longer hold back.
>Thick ropes of semen are being pumped into her, the entire time you fight back the urge to pass out from the combined pleasure and loss of blood.
>A couple moments pass, your ejaculation ends and your master, Shiori has recovered from her orgasm.
>She covers your eyes with her hand and bites down into your neck
>You begin to wonder if losing any more blood would be dangerous, is your life ending tonight?
>As your eyes are covered, you hear her voice in your head, as if she were talking to you through telepathy.
>"Seems you're able to at least be a little bit human, you may rest now."
>Unable to take any more, your eyes close, however you still can still make out the distinct feeling of her tongue, dragging along your neck.
>You wake up the next morning, once again fully clothed, however this time, you are not in your servant's room.
>"Good morning, butler, prepare breakfast immediately."
>Shiori is fully clothed, all traces of what happened the previous night are gone, however you're able to confirm it's real just based on the fact that you awaken in her room.
>"Hurry up, or do I have to drop candle wax on your back again for being late?"
>Her tone sounds impatient, seems she's been waiting for you to wake up for some time.
>You quickly stand, having regained full control of your body. "Yes madam, right away."
>Before you leave, you bow towards her, however as you raise your head, you catch a glimpse of a content smile.
>It seems you won't be the only one thinking about the previous night this time.

##Day 7 - Police Shiori

>How long has it been since this life of yours had truly begun?
>Another brilliant steal
>The enjoyment and the thrill.
>An auction house selling a rare crystal
>Getting in and out was simple, it's even become a game for you
>You even have a calling card, 'Lusene'
>As you watch from a distance, in awe of your own crime. The police had already arrived, questioning the guests
>You gaze down at the auction hall, an explosion blows up in the right wing of the hall
>A brilliant distraction, but what was the point? You had already escaped.
>"Damn, I've outdone myself with that explosion." For none other than your own entertainment an explosion was needed.
>You begin to walk off into the nearby woods, but before you do you notice one more car arrive at the scene and a girl stepping out
>There a girl that looked to be new, stepped out of the car, bracing herself against the cold wind as she fearlessly walked into the building.
>Witnessing her in itself was enough to catch your attention, but you didn't want to delay further. You decide to leave this scene.
>"Shiori Novella, detective working with the police, let me through."
>She shows her badge to the nearby officer, and walks into the building.
>As she walks in, she asks to be escorted to the room where the crystal was held.
>Walking down the hallway, scenarios begin to play in her head.
>"4 armed guards along the way, perhaps a disguise? No they're likely on shift work, Distractions?"
>Her walk continues, and she happens to gaze towards the ceiling
>"The ceiling leads into the next ro- ah!"
>Before even entering the room, she's solved how you managed to get in and out.
>As she walks into the room, she hears a click and several trip lasers are deactivated.
>She begins to wander the room, inspecting the sides of the room only to notice two things
>Cut electrical wire, you had cut the electricity in the room and took the crystal before the back-up power returned.
>The second thing she notices is your calling card.
>"Lusene, a play on Lupin Arsene I see. Clever."
>As she walks out of the room, she swears to herself that she will catch you.
>Days pass, turning into weeks
>You've had various run-ins with the new detective
>Working for the police, she's their new ace
>She intrigues you, no one before her has gotten close to your trail
>You decide to up your game a little, going as far as to leave your calling card early, announcing your intentions in advance
>Why are you going so far?
>The answer is always the same.
>"It gets my heart racing, the thrill of it all."
>A grand museum
>Your next big heist
>A painting
>As you stand with a crowd, walking on a guided tour, your intentions are clear
>Scout out your entry, your exit
>You take note of the heightened security, all of it a joke to you
>"Are you here to see the museum, or are you here for something else? Lusene?"
>Your ears perk up slightly as you hear the question, it didn't come from the tour guide, that's for certain.
>She stands next to you and casually smiles at you.
>"It's been a while Anon, seven years perhaps?"
>You look towards the lady smiling at you, and then it hits you like a truck.
>"Shiori?" you ask, taken aback by her appearance
>"Oh you do remember me? You always sent me gifts on my birthday but you stopped after a while! What was the last one? A book about Lupin Arsene?"
>It's all coming back to you now.
>Your childhood days, spent with Shiori.
>She then asks you again, what you're doing at the museum.
>You casually smile at her and give her a generic response
>"I've been into the arts recently."
>"Shall we make this a date then?" She smiles at you casually, however you already know how she is.
>Shiori gazes at your face, watching for the slightest reaction.
>You're forced to politely decline, being with her on the night of your big heist would make it impossible for you to pull off your show..
>"It seems we'll both be busy tonight." A melancholic smile can be seen on her face as she says this.
>You tilt your head slightly and ask what she means.
>"Ah, I guess I never told you before, I'm now the lead detective for the Lusene case."
>The revelation shocks you, the one girl who has been interesting you as you evade her grasp is none other than the girl you grew up with in your childhood.
>The night approaches, it's time for your grand play to begin
>Your voice begins to play out throughout the building
>"Ladies and Gentlemen, I am Lusene!"
>However, this voice does not come from you, but in-fact, a recording that you had set in advance
>Many guards rush past you, they seem to be approaching a different part of the museum
>You see many guards drawing firearms and pointing at a man with a carneval mask and a black top hat.
>A smirk comes across your face, it's perfect, the projection you prepared as a distraction.
>You check your watch, 3, 2, 1
>An explosion occurs at the rooftop, all the guards are distracted by it for a brief moment.
>In that faintest of moments, you swipe the painting you were after, your announcement a distraction from the very beginning, your true goal was a different painting altogether. You begin to leave, towards a back exit that you had prepared
>Meanwhile your projection that you prepared in advance had already disappeared, your laughter resonating throughout the building, confusing the guards.
>You put on a simple face mask, a quick change of clothes, and begin walking down the dark alleyways, the painting stuffed in a bag you had prepared just outside the exit in advance.
>"Freeze Lusene!"
>Her voice commanding, enough to shake you for the briefest of moments.
>You stand up straight and you turn around to face her, it's too dark for her to see your face properly, and it's also obscured by your face mask.
>"Very clever tricks, but I've been following you for a while now, I know your methods, you gave away the explosion distraction the last time at the auction hall!"
>As you listen to her, you begin to wonder
>How long has it been since this life of yours had truly begun?
>It all started when you stole an expensive watch and sold it off, just so you could buy Shiori a proper birthday gift when you were children.
>Ever since then you had been addicted to the thrill of stealing.
>However now you come face to face with that friend, with you being on the receiving end of a pistol shot if you made any wrong moves.
>You begin to chuckle a little, enough to unnerve her as she asks you: "What's so funny?"
>Finally you speak, a monotone voice disguising your real voice.
>"Well, you found me, but have you caught me?"
>She readies her aim, ready to shoot at your legs and stop your escape if you dared to move.
>Is this it? Have you finally been caught?
>You drop the bag and begin to approach her, slowly.
>She holds her pistol steady. "Stop! Don't move!"
>As soon as your face is within better view, you lower your face mask just enough to reveal your face to her.
>Her eyes widen, however her pistol remains steady, as if she had a gut feeling of who Lusene really was.
>"Happy birthday, Shiori."
>"Eh?"
>Suddenly the guards arrive and demand she drop the pistol, it's too dark for them to see who's who in this situation.
>She turns around briefly to see the guards aiming at her.
>You take that moment to drop something her pocket
>"Wait! No!" she exclaimed to the guards approaching her.
>And with that, you grab your bag quickly and run, easily jumping over a couple fences and into a getaway vehicle you had prepared.
>The guards approach Shiori and realize they've made a mistake, that she was trying to apprehend you

## Day 8 - Mafia Shiori

>Your 'business' has been going well
>You've been running the town for several years
>Small business owners dogeza before you
>Larger corporations bow their heads to you in respect
>Criminals flock to you, trying to make a name for themselves.
>You've been enjoying life's simple pleasures while your underlings worry about the harder stuff
>You're anon, mafia crime boss.
>However, recently you've been getting reports from your underlings
>"A new mafia leader is trying to settle in on my city?"
>You repeat the words your right hand man had told you
>"Y-yes boss" he says, nervously, afraid of incurring your wrath
>You look at him with somewhat of a glare but then you relax a little
>"So does this foolish lad have a name?"
>He looks at you and responds again, in the same nervous tone: "A-actually boss, it's a girl, she's been m-messing up some of our business and even tried to a-arrange a meeting with you."
>You look at him, flabbergasted by what you just heard. A woman had been messing with you?
>You sigh and think on the implications of this, before finally responding back to your right-hand man: "Alright, I'll meet her, tell her to come to our restaurant tomorrow night, she can bring a couple guards with her if she wants."
>The time flies by rather quickly, an uneventful day leads to an eventful evening.
>You're sitting by a table at the restaurant floor.
>Two guards behind you, hands behind their back, suited up with sunglasses to hide their eyes.
>Some of your men are at the top floor, enjoying what the night brings.
>You hear the sounds of tires screeching outside, followed by the sounds of a woman, cussing at what seems to have been her chauffeur.
>The door to the restaurant flies open and a young lady dressed in a suit, sunglasses on her head.
>Is this the woman that's been messing with you?
>Behind her are two large men, which appear to be her guards, however they're both wearing paper mache cat heads.
>Some of your men snicker at the sight of this, you can hear them whispering things like: "That can't be real."
>The girl glares at them and immediately brandishes her gun, shooting some of the grunts that were whispering.
>Everyone else immediately draws their firearms and points them at Shiori and her two bodyguards.
>You raise your hand, commanding them to stand down and then you face the girl.
>"My apologies, some of the men were very rude to your...guards."
>She smiles at you, and speaks in a prim, proper, ladylike tone.
>"It's alright, Anon. Salt and Pepper usually gather attention like that, but they're sweet. Well, sometimes Pepper can be a handful."
>She elbows the guard cat she refers to as 'Pepper', he grunts just a little but proceeds to stand up straight again.
>Shiori takes her seat opposite of you on the table, crossing her leg. Her two cat guards, Salt and Pepper, stand behind her, mirroring your two guards.
>A wide grin appears on her face, it's alluring enough to almost suck you in entirely.
>"I know how people in this town see you, fear, respect, admiration. Where do you think I fall under?"
>Before you move to answer, she quickly leans over and puts her finger on your lip.
>"Why don't we work together Anon? We don't have to be rivals when we can instead be friends, partners, or maybe something more."
>You've been in this business for a while
>You've met plenty of people in life
>This girl however, strikes something in you, is it uncertainty?
>You sigh deeply, then you ask her: "Alright, what exactly are your plans, tell me first and I'll decide then."
>She smiles again, then clicks her fingers.
>Salt behind her, produces a cannister and places it on the table.
>"I have what the people here want, and you have the connections and distribution methods. Of course I could just take them from you, ruin all of your business and sell it myself, but why go through the hassle?"
>You look at the can, on it is the word printed "Shiorium".
>You then look at her and see her gazing into your eyes, her golden eyes displaying an intense fire in them.
>"So Anon, shall we be partners? Shall we call it 'exclusive' even?"
>As those words escape her lips, you catch a glance of a wicked smile.

## Day 9 - Wizard (Witch) Shiori

>Shiori stares into a mirror, her reflection stares back at her with an evil grin.
>"I'm not an evil witch."
>She repeats this to herself, over and over.
>Her reflection speaks back to her.
>"No no, you're not an evil witch, of course not, you didn't cast all those hexes, all those curses, you didn't plague the farmers or blight the water! Ehehehe. That was all me! Ah but wait...I'm also you!"
>Shiori begins to cry, her tears running down her face
>"I-I'm not an evil witch."
>Her face is shaky, she sniffles as she tries to talk to herself in the mirror
>"You're not an evil witch, you're just you, and I'm also you."
>She screams back after hearing the voice in her head: "YOU AREN'T ME!"
>Suddenly all of the voices stop, she sees herself panting in front of the mirror and proceeds to wash her face.
>The next day in the town square, Shiori is there in her shop.
>Many townspeople have come to know Shiori, the benevolent witch.
>They come to her for healing, good luck, fortune readings and other things.
>You drag yourself in to her shop, your leg is injured.
>"Anon? you're back with another injury huh?"
>You look at her and smile awkwardly, sitting on a chair
>She brings a chair, sitting across from you. She then takes your leg, resting it on her lap.
>"I've grown accustomed to your frequent visits, though I've started to feel as though you get injured so you have an excuse to come see me."
>She giggles as she says this, deep down, maybe her words are right, you like seeing her, even as she's wearing her hat and holding her staff, she still seems like a cute girl to you.
>A faint light envelops your leg, and soon after the injury is gone
>"There, all better Anon."
>You stand up and test your leg, it's true, the injury is gone.
>She smiles at you gently, but then the sounds of multiple footsteps, marching footsteps, are heard outside.
>The two of you walk outside of her shop to see multiple guards standing in front
>One particular guard steps forward, he looks like a man that only got his position by bribing others.
>"Miss Shiori Novella, the lord of the town would like to see you to discuss the allegations surrounding you and the 'plague' you brought to the neighbouring town."
>You've heard of the lord of the town before, outright scum that sleeps with whatever woman he could get his hands on.
>You step in front of Shiori in anger, claiming that the lord has the wrong person.
>The guard immediately punches you in the stomach and tosses you back towards Shiori.
>You land in her arms, but as you glance up at Shiori, what you see isn't a normal reaction
>You could almost see what looks to be an evil grin, followed by the sounds of slight giggling.
>However as soon as you blink, her face returns to that full of worry.
>"Anon?! Are you ok?!" She exclaims.
>Several of the guards then proceed to vandalize her shop, breaking the windows, tearing down her bookshelves, slicing and killing her plants
>"What the hell are you doing?!" You barely stumble to your feet and question the guards
>The guard that had punched you earlier steps up and announces: "This is a taste of the lord's fury, and there'll be more to come if Miss Novella doesn't comply."
>The guards step out of the now broken down shop and they all collectively walk off.
>You quickly turn to Shiori who's now on her knees in front of her shop.
>You place a hand on her shoulder, however as it rests on her shoulder, you begin to hear giggling
>"Ahhh...Poor Shiori, what did I tell you? It's ok, rest. I'll handle the rest."
>You're somewhat disturbed by the sounds of Shiori talking to herself, however you nudge at her again out of concern, calling her name: "Shiori?"
>She then faces you, her eyes no longer shining the beautiful gold they normally do, but now reflect a deep black, as if staring into a void.
>"Ah, Shiori cherishes you quite a bit, I wonder how she'd feel if she saw your lifeless corpse, would she call out for me more?"
>The tone of her voice holds no warmth, her words hold no kindness, instead it's almost wicked, cold, unfeeling, inherently evil.
>"Shiori what's wrong?!" You ask in utter confusion, as she has never spoke like this before.
>Her grin becomes wider, her eyes of deep black stare into your soul and her response is as cold as a frozen winter night: "Shiori is not here right now, but I'm also a part of Shiori."
>Shiori then looks towards the lords residence, a far away mansion atop a hill in the distance. She then closes her eyes and starts chanting a spell
>You hear the chant, it doesn't sound graceful like when she healed you, in fact it sounds...wrong, disturbing, foul even.
>The next thing that happens is something that shocks you to your very being
>A black cloud slowly descends over the lord's residence, before slowly turning transparent.
>"Ahhh, I can't wait until their screams are heard, soon the lord, his guards, his servants, the prisoners, the women and children! All will sing the beautiful song of pure death."
>You gaze at her figure, she's still the same in terms of appearance, but her personality is completely warped and twisted, her face that had kindness, love and care.
>That face was now exhibiting something akin to euphoria over what she had just done.
>You shake her gently, though she's unresponsive to you, as if you don't exist in the moment.
>"But what is a song, if no one can hear it?"
>She then casts another spell, her chant equally as disturbing as the previous one.
>This time however, nothing happened.
>"What did you do?" You ask Shiori, no longer sure what it is you feel, fear? Is perhaps the closest emotion.
>As if to answer your question, a scream is heard, all the way in the distance.
>Sounds like that shouldn't be able to be heard from this far away
>Suddenly the next scream, and another, followed by cries for help and even someone begging for their life to be spared.
>The wicked Shiori that you've only just met, that had shattered all thoughts you had about the cute, innocent Shiori, begins to hold her face with both of her hands
>There she laughs, and giggles, her face looks as if she had just heard the greatest news of her life, or experienced the most intense feeling ever.
>Her laughter and giggles turn into outright cackling, like a mad woman. Almost enough to frighten you.
>She then stares deep into your eyes.
>"There, the deed is done. Now be a good little boy and take care of her. If I have to come out again, I will curse you next."
>As soon as her words are finished, and before you have the chance to say anything back to her, Shiori collapses on you, her chest rising and falling as if asleep.
>The screams and howls of pain coming from the lord's residence continue into the night, many of the townsfolk are scared and panicked, however some believe that he got his just desserts.
>You had left Shiori to rest in your house, on your bed, but upon your return she's sitting up hugging her knees.
>She then looks at you with tears in her eyes, as they glow golden once again.
>"A-anon...I'm...I'm not an evil witch...right?!"
>She asks you, afraid of your answer, but one that she must hear at all costs.
>However as you open your lips, she holds her hands to her ears and begins to repeat to herself, almost like a mantra.
>"I'm not an evil witch...I'm not an evil witch. I'm not..."
>You slowly approach her and gently put your arms around her as she continues her mantra. Her fear and paranoia aren't exactly comforted by you, however you can feel her lean her head against your chest.
>The last scream rings out, this time it's the lord of the town, begging for mercy, saying things like "I'll give anything! Money! Women! Power! Just spare me!"
>Then the sounds of choking, followed by a final thud.
>Shiori is unphased by any of this, she's still telling herself that she isn't evil.
>You gently begin to rub the back of her head, your fingers running through her hair, it's the only comfort you can give to her right now.
