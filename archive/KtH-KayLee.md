###->Tao<-
>Tao: Lifestyle
It is not in her people's way to give their way of living, their Tao, a name. To them, it is simply The Way to Live. It is not codified into text, but some simple adages that apply are the following:

Life is a competition with two others: Yourself from yesterday, and Yourself from tomorrow.
The purpose is simple: To be better than one was yesterday, to strive to be better than tomorrow.
The foundation of Life is strife, to strive is to live.

>Philosophy:
Mortal (175)
The notion of *anything* being eternal and everlasting is ridiculous in her eyes. If such beliefs held any weight, why have there been so many Sovereigns? Wouldn't there have only ever been a single one? As for their claims for an immutable truth, the Gods seem to differ, what with the way they can alter even the most fundamental precepts of reality. The way of the world, and now even the Heavens, is change and to change.

>Tao Heart:
Heart Force (-10) (165)
Her willpower is unwavering; as unchanging as something can be in this world. Hers is a strength that will not, *can not*, know despair.



###->Cultivation<-

>Generation
Elder (Age 21)
She entered into the Realms of the Elders at the youngest age possible. Once she reached this age, she decided that she needed the experience that could only be gained through travel and new surroundings in order to improve.

>Qi Gathering:
Divine Grade VII [VIII] (-45) (120)
Exotic Root (Ki) (-25) (95)

Some call it Ki, others call it Life, others call it the Spirit. Whatever name is given to it, it is the energy that animates the living, letting them surpass themselves and each other.  This energy can be applied in an almost countless number of ways; from a devastating attack that leaves none standing in its wake, to restoring health to those on the brink of death. This qi manifests as a green light that becomes more vibrant as its power increases.

It seems destined therefore, that the One of Legend would have in addition to their birthright of blood, such a powerful Root and the Talent to wield it.

>Body Tempering:
Tao Grade VII [IX]
Royal Bloodline (Super Saiyan)

->![Kay Lee's standard, First Stage Battle Form](https://i.imgur.com/KcSYw7Z.jpg)<-

Her awakened blood has allowed her to access a rare transformation exclusive to her people: The Super state. The base form is not unique to her; many in their history have managed to achieve it, though vanishingly rare at her young age. The higher that one reaches in their Body Cultivation, the greater the form of Super state that is achievable, with corresponding increases in strength, speed, reflexes, etc. It is said in their legends that at the highest tiers of cultivation, the form can attain a wholly unique divine state, though none of the ancestors are willing to confirm or deny such notions.
 
>Soul Refining:
Mortal Grade IV
Soul Refining is not given much weight in her people's eyes. It is seen as cowardice to use deception, trickery, and illusions to wage war, that no self-respecting warrior should lower themselves to. It is taught and practiced only so that there is enough experience to recognize the deception of those with lesser pride and honor.

###->Personal History<-

>Taoist Roots: Barbarian Tribe (Body Cultivation, Attack, Endurance)

Her people are warriors, almost without exception. All are graded upon birth, looking for signs that they carry the potential to be powerful fighters. Those with such potential are taken to be trained, while those without are relegated to more menial roles, though slaves and machines are typically used for the lowest jobs.

Kay Lee was detected with utterly abnormal strength. Some argued that she should be banished in fear of what she may become, while others put forward that it would be a disservice to their worldview to not see how powerful she could become. Fortunately for her, the latter won, resulting in her training. 


>Circumstances: Bounty (+10) (105), Non-Human, Foreign Power

Kay Lee is not from this world, or even human. She is from a distant world, with foreign cultivation customs, and wholly different species. Her people were said to be refugees to that world, surviving and rebuilding under the guide of their founder and most honored ancient ancestor, **孫悟空**. 
She is a recent arrival in this world, only traveling here via a portal that she stumbled through while on her own travels. She is a proverbial fish out of water, in a world that is on average far weaker, yet possessing heights that she had yet to see, much less attain herself.
It should be no surprise then, that she encountered a preening Cultivator who, believing that their name carried weight to one unknowing of this world, earned her ire and then her fist. Such slights are not forgiven quickly, and now a bounty is placed on her capture. Thus far, none have been successful, unless success is defined as giving her a quick and easy battle to enjoy.


>Life Encounters: Flashy Heroics, Silly Mischief, Battlefield Brother
(To be expanded)

>Fated Encounter: Ancient Bloodline (Tao Grade Bloodline, Royal Bloodline, Legendary Super Saiyan)

Kay Lee's Super state is unlike anything seen in living memory. A mutation that is said to only appear once per Sovereign's reign. A Legendary Super State that stands above all others, so long as they live long enough to realize their potential. The legends pertaining to these beings rarely have happy endings...


###->Martial Arts<-

>Fighting Style: Fist (Attack, Endurance)
Trained by the warriors of her people, she is a straightforward and direct fighter. She does not rely on weapons or external devices, as they are seen as crutches for those too weak to fight. 

>Comprehension: Divine (-70) (35)
Her ability to process, understand, and emulate techniques is unparalleled, equal to the greatest of prodigies (though not to the rarest legends of those who have achieved true reincarnation). Merely observing a technique is enough for her to be able to perform it, a day is enough to reach what would be considered mastery, and what she can achieve with more work is beyond what all but the few that could be considered her peers can reach.


#####Techniques:
>Realization of the Soul of the Eternal Warrior (Divine Grade VII Qi Cultivation + Endurance) (-10) (25)

Many who cultivate their qi do so in peace and serenity, in order to focus on the act itself to maximize the drawing in of qi. While that is certainly one way to use this technique, its true power comes out on the battlefield. There, as Life clashes against itself and thereby grows stronger, so too does Kay Lee cultivate that energy into herself.

Outside of battle, it takes the form of training, eating, sleeping, playing. The struggle for life to survive and grow. Life cannot be stagnant and stationary, it must move and fight to survive.

>Infinite Potential Drawn Out (Divine Grade VII Body Tempering + Endurance)

For the body to grow stronger, weakness must be beaten out of it. Muscles get stronger through tears. Bones get stronger through breaks. The technique comes in causing such injuries, without exceeding what the body can repair. After all, a muscle torn off the bone is weaker, not stronger. This technique can be utilized in the heat of battle, where the damage taken can be taken and refined into power.
In conjunction with the above, it allows her to become permanently more powerful as she fights, as the act of battling itself becomes the perfect catalyst for cultivation.

>Attack: Strike of the Warrior Race (Divine Grade VII)

An Attacking Technique focused on combining the user's Qi and Body talent, qi is manifested externally, particularly around the fists, drastically increasing the strength of attacks. There are many variations that these strikes can take.

>Attack: Explosive Strength of the Warrior's Burning Soul (Divine Grade VII)

Manifesting qi into projectile attacks, this technique allows ranged combat to be more than random flinging. The attacks that are variants of this technique can be in a multitude of shapes, from large beams to spheres.

#####Advantages:

>Overflowing Charisma (-5) (20)

While Kay Lee is considered beautiful (owing no small part to her ability to satisfy both conventional and more physically minded connoisseurs), she also stands above others in a more literal sense. In other words, she's tall as well as beautiful.

>Perfect Efficiency (-10) (10)

In conjunction with her preternatural comprehension, she is able to refine, simplify, and hone her techniques even further, showing her true genius in full bloom.

>Undying Tenacity (-10) (0)

For some, being raised to believe you are destined for absolute greatness would lead to a fragile ego that would shatter upon encountering hardship. Not so with Kay Lee. Her body won't give out until her mind and soul do, and with her Tao Heart, that's no easy feat.
