>"I shall destroy you, and all who stand upon my path. Gaze upon my visage and die!"

>Full Name
Gyldenwulf Wægmundings - 吉爾登伍爾夫·韋格蒙丁斯

>Voice Actor
Patrick Seitz 

>Type of Tao - Lifestyle of the Barbarian
Gyldenwulf is at heart, a true barbarian, a roving pillager who holds no value in mind but to meet mighty foes in battle, to destroy them utterly, and to take their riches as your own. To him, the lifestyle of a savage warrior, doing as he pleases, is the one thing truly worth upholding.

>Philosophy of Tao - Mortal
Gyldenwulf is a materialistic man - holding little in the way of values beyond that of a warrior's oath. There is little presence in his mind for the detailed minutia of Taoistic philosophy and the laws of Heaven and Nature. There is no endgoal to his path, no final realization of the mind - only the eternal fighting of a true warrior.

Young yet to have been alive were he a mere mortal, Gyldenwulf's potential is shown is the already great power held within his body - inborn from the ancient blood coursing within his veins, and the strength of his warrior's spirit.  What his spiritual energy lacks, his body more than compensates, forged to perfection through his battles like a mountain's cliff atop a shore. And it is in this blood, coursing through his veins, that lays the Root of the Freezing Flame, the fire that burns with the fury of the sun yet remains as cold as the frigid wastes of his homeland. 

Gyldenwulf's body is blessed with the blood of the Wægmundings. Such a blessing has rendered his body a durability unlike none other, making him nigh immune to most cutting or piercing attacks. Yet such abilities are not without limitation - weakened by the cursed poison of the Draconic Tyrant, this durability is unable to hold against those of signifcantly higher power. Even againstfoes of matched power, they are only able to offer a mere reduction to the damages incurred by blunt force. Yet the grand potential achieved by his ancestor lays dormant within him still - channeling all his energy upon a singular moment of fury, Gyldenwulf is able to momentarily restore this power to its perfected state, hardening his body to immunity against almost all types of physical damage. In such a state, his body, hardened to a state unmatched by mortals and immortals alike, further allows him to fight those well above his realm. 

>Taoist Roots - Barbarian Tribe, Loose Cultivator
Hailing from the a land far beyond the known north, where the land is cold and even the barest knowledge of the concept of cultivation remain as distant myths, Gyldenwulf is a barbarian in the truest sense of the word. Yet these lands hold no knowledge of his people, and he holds little in the way of guidance outside of his inherited will. His path as a cultivator is a lonesome one.

>Circumstances - Bounty, Foreign Power
Hailing from the northern barbarian wastes, Gyldenwulf has cut a path of havoc and destruction throughout the land, felling many a cultivator sect by his lonesome in his boundless campaign of fight and slaughter, seizing their treasures as war loot to please his fancy. This behaviour has gained him infamy, and the ire of many a powerful organizations, who wasted no time to put a price on the head of such a dangerous barbarian.

> Life Encounters - Ending Emnity, Battlefield Brother, Unusual Encounter
(Mystery yet to be uncovered)

>Fated Encounter
In a bygone era past, far far beyond the northern borders, once existed a barbarian of unparalelled might, his physical prowess far above any within the frigid wastelands. This warrior united his tribe, raising from the ground a power comparable to even the mightiest of the martial empires of the south. Raising his host of warriors, he led them against the mightiest of enemies - The True Dragon, Nibelung, Tyrant of the North. For years, the battle raged on, with neither side gaining the upper hand. Finally, when all seemed lost, the Legendary Warrior delivered a final, decisive strike - but at what cost? For even as he dealt the killing blow, his own life was claimed by the tyrannical dragon's magickal poisoned breath. With the death of their King, their Kingdom fell, and was forgotten to history. Yet the blood of Beowulf was not.

Though he had once been a mere mortal, the blood of Wægmundings coursed through the veins of Gyldenwulf. His willpower unmatched, he awakened the slumbering power deep inside him, unleashing a dark scourge upon the world...

>Advantages - Undying Tenacity, Plentiful Wealth
Gyldenwulf possesses an unearthly willpower - borne not from his blood, but from his boundless ambition and bloodlusted bravery. His decades of pillaging have also left him with a grand menagerie of treasures, a veritable hoard of wealth, well-kept by the the barbarian at his flying Palace Barge. 

>Custom Treasures - Other, High Quality, Like Divine Steel, Low Spirituality, Magic Treasure, Spirit Stone Slot
Eotenskeið - the Giant's Ship

It is a grand flying barge, four hundred meters long and seventy meters wide. Roaming the dark currents of the sky, this marauding vessel's dragon prow and black sails have been the last grim visage of many a sect. It is the home, treasury and personal transport of Gyldenwulf and his beast. The Eotenskeið is a vessel almost without compare, able to outrun even the strongest of immortals and resist even the strongest of their attacks. What little spirituality resides inside this mobile palace is capable only of sailing to it's master help, should it ever become endangered.

> Auxiliary Treasure - Cultivation Elixir (Spirit Roof), Tamed Beasts

**Frigid Nectar, Hidromel of the Depths**

Concoted for him by a haggardly witch in exchange for her life, the Frigid Nectar is a mystical elixir, rumored to be as cold as the depths of the northern wastelands and potent enough to bring even the strongest of warriors to a drunken stupor. Guzzling it whole, this cursed mead only served to awaken the blazing power of the Freezing Flame within Gyldenwulf's heart. 


**Lupa, the Winter Beast**

In the dark, northern vastness of the northern regions from whence Gyldenwulf hails, no deathlier beasts are there than the feared Greatwolves - large beasts of inhuman strength, capable of destroying entire villages on their lonesome. Lupa - as she came to be known, was one of these beasts, and a dire one indeed - though but a mere pup, she had far outgrown her kin, hunting them for sustenance just as they would hunt humans and other animals. She soon match her met, however, when a young and inexperienced Gyldenwulf, drunk still from his newly gained bloodpower, deemed to fight such a beast on his own. The ensuing battle - which lasted for two days and two nights, had left both on the brink of death, their strength and brutality matched almost perfectly. Like two pieces of a puzzle matching themselves, their souls, overburst with the joy of a grand foe, soon saw themselves like a water's reflection - two savage barbarous warriors with a heart that desired only combat and victory - and thus, a bond was sealed forevermore of Master and Hound.

She has since then followed Gyldenwulf loyally, her strength growing just like his as their grand cavalcade of violence razed their way across the world. 


>Fatal Flaws -  Mundane Mind
>Special Perks - Inherited Wisdom
Greatest among his flaws, and the most glaring one - Gyldenwulf is a true scourge, a bloodthirsty fighter who seeks only to crush his opponnets with his full might - he spends little time or effort in the workings of the mystic energy that flows within him, the complex workings of the Tao but mere words of magic to his barbaric mind. Despite that, he is a brutal fighter, each vicious blow mighty yet simple - all except one. 

> Stinganfistol, the Realm Piercing Fist - Grade VII Physical Trump Card Technique
The only technique created by the brutal mind of Gyldenwulf - if it can be called that. Calling upon every last ounce of his soul's might, the warrior musters all of his strenght into his fist for a singular strike of amazing power. This process is slow, forcing the user to remain unable to fight as their fist and eyes are encased in the cold blue flames of his spiritual root. When unleashed, it releases an attack capable of turning most enemies to mere ash, piercing through even the most esoteric of techniques and releasing forth an gigantic maelstrom of flame and force, burning away anything and everything in its path. It is a technique capable of reducing entire nations into ashes and cinder.
