PFP/Icon ID: A picture of cyborg ninja Genji Shimada from Overwatch in a pfp overlay. Genji is looking 3/4ths to the left, he's made of metal that looks silvery on his helmet & dark grey/brownish towards his chest. On his helmet he has a neon green slit that follows his eyeline. The PFP overlay looks as if it is being eaten, with teeth at the top and bottom, with a bit of distortion so there are lines branching off of it.
This is a screenshot taken directly from an official Overwatch animation!!
