#### Imai Relationship Chart

>Nyoro Hoge

*"I have no problems with Hoge as our class rep."*

Soujyuuro can notice Hoge most of the time, thanks to the footprint their mind leaves on his quirk. He thinks they have an admirable work ethic.

>Chihiro Mitsurugi

*"She's simply... awesome."*

Mitsurugi is the worst possible opponent for Soujyuuro during any battle exercise, and he admires her for that. Her technique has been honed to the level of constant instinctual movement, so he cannot see through her moves by reading her mind. He can only glimpse at her general gameplan, such as "I'll go on the offensive" or "I'll focus on his right side, where his defense is weakest." He can still use Mindbreaker to project bad plans into her head, but only having 2 thirds of his ability is still a major blow.

He hopes she has a bright future as a hero.

>Bobby Samson

*"His quirk is cool."*

Soujyuuro doesn't have any strong impressions of Bobby. He fits his personal stereotype of an exchange student: a powerful quirk, heroic pedigree, and an unserious attitude.

>Sora Tanaka

*"It's hypocritical of me, but I can't respect his reason for becoming a hero."*

He thinks Sora's quirk is one of the coolest in the class, along with Bobby's and Kaylee's.

>Kaylee Suzuki

*"I wish I could help her."*

Soujyuuro feels awful whenever he sees how Kaylee gets treated by the Korean girls. But he also feels his poor social skills would only make everything worse if he tried to interfere.

>Hifumi Takeda

*"After a while, you can't help but start to believe in his hype."*

Soujyuuro can't get along with arrogant people, but Hifumi's confidence is rather contagious. The matchup between their quirks is fun, although Hifumi probably doesn't feel the same way.

>Minerva Kim

*"The least annoying. I respect her diligence, but not the company she surrounds herself with. "*

>Hailey Chang

*"The most annoying. She tests the limits of my composure whenever I'm in ear range of her."*

>Faith Kang

*"Annoying."*

>Maxine Nguyen

*"Annoying."*

>Edith Lee

*"Annoying."*

>Noah Abrams

*"The nicest person I've ever met. He'll easily make it to the Top 10 after graduating."*

Soujyuuro takes Noah's demeanor at face value but also thinks he's kind of a pushover and trusts people too much.

>Inigo Myoga

*"I wish I had that kind of confidence."*

Soujyuuro wants to keep moving forward undaunted the way Inigo does after being rejected for the nth time. His construct has a pleasant personality.

>Christopher Cain

*"..."*

*"..."*

*"... He has a lot of interesting insights on pro heroes."*

Soujyuuro is deathly afraid of Christopher copying Mindbreaker and babbling about its true nature to the rest of the class. It's an awful feeling since he suffered from quirk discrimination himself and is now afraid of another's powers. He tries his hardest to get that fear out of his mind, but it's always on the back of his head. Thinking about Christopher leaves Soujyuuro depressed and mentally flagellating himself, so he tries not to. The fact that their seats are close feels like the universe is doing its best to screw with his life.

>Son Jugo

*"A peculiar individual."*

Jugo is the person he has the easiest time making casual conversation with, but his battle junkie tendencies are creepy to Soujyuuro. Just like with Sora, he can't respect his reasons for coming to hero school, but Jugo is so friendly that it's hard to hold it against him.

>Ashleigh Katsuragi

*"... Somehow, I feel like I can relate to her."*

Soujyuuro takes inspiration from her in heroics exercises since their quirks aren't suited for solving things with brute force. He hopes they can both become great heroes, but since she seems just as awkward as him, it's hard for him to convey that to her. He roots for her success silently.

>Orochi Atsushi

*"Intense."*

He considers her the coolest person in their class, skirting the line between "delinquent" and "role model". A resolute figure that doesn't shy away from trouble.

>Yui Sagara

*"The strongest who walks beyond the night."*

He refers to Yui as the strongest not physically, but mentally. He can guess her situation, after not seeing her in the entrance exam and spotting Rosethorn speaking with her several times. It takes a lot of resolve to prove your heroism the way she's doing. He also finds it impossible to talk to her due to her demeanor, so she's another one he silently roots for.

>Sandatsu Owari

*"I hope he's doing okay."*

Soujyuuro is curious about Owari's whole government sponsor deal, but even his socially stunted self can detect it's a touchy subject.

>Rosethorn

*"Sensei is a dependable, super-cool hero. I try my best to take her lessons to heart, but sometimes it's hard to grasp their true meaning."*

Rosethorn is his favorite Shiketsu teacher, possibly his favorite teacher ever. He tends to give her too much credit, trying to see deeper meanings in the simple ethics exercises she gives the class.
