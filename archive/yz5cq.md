>Kurt Prufer, senior engineer of Topf and Sohne, testifying in Erfurt, Germany, March 5, 1946.
>Q. Who apart from you participated in the construction of the furnaces?
>A. From 1941-2, I constructed the furnaces. The technical drawings were done by Mr. Keller. The ventilation systems of the "Kremas" [crematoriums] were constructed by senior engineer Karl Schultze.
>Q. Were you the sole Topf engineer in Auschwitz in spring 1943?
>A. No, [senior engineer Karl] Schultze was with me in Auschwitz at the time. I saw personally about 60 corpses of women and men of different ages, which were being prepared for incineration. That was at 10 in the morning. I witnessed the incineration of six corpses and came to the conclusion that the furnaces were working well.
>Q. Did you see a gas chamber next to the crematoriums?
>A. Yes, I did see one next to the crematorium. Between the gas chamber and the crematorium there was a connecting structure.
>Q. Did you know that in the gas chamber and in the crematoriums there took place the liquidation of innocent human beings?
>A. I have known since spring 1943 that innocent human beings were being liquidated in Auschwitz gas chambers and that their corpses were subsequently incinerated in the crematoriums.
>Q. Who is the designer of the ventilation systems for the gas chambers?
>A. Schultze was the designer of the ventilation systems in the gas chambers; and he installed them.
>Q. Why was the brick lining of the muffles so quickly damaged?
>A. The bricks were damaged after six months because the strain on the furnaces was colossal.
