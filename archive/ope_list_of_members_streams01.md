!!!info     Behind the cryptic name is in fact a page of the general information for the membership content by Nerissa. The membership content list was created preventively as the possibility of more people joining the Jailbirds ranks in the future and that might be interested in supporting Nerissa in her projects via joining her membership. We'll provide a list and details for the membership in this page and just for the sake of it, we'll just say that the membership streams will contain Zatsudan parts - so read the disclaimer of the Zatsudan parts - we know there will be questions about this eventually. The current level of production for Members content is still uncertain due to a low sample size but we'll get a clearer picture to paint as more member streams happen.
	Another word of warning: we're not planning to store nor making a list of any posts from the members section. Any screenshot of member posts is also excluded, that would be unfair for anyone that spent the minimum effort for supporting Nerissa and it's not highly regarded either.

![Image description](https://files.catbox.moe/f9inkg.png)  ** *Disclamer regarding member zatsus or zatsudan parts* **
    This list exists mainly provide a brief overview over Nerissa's members streams. Due to the sensible nature of the Zatsudan bits, which will inevitably happen in the case of the members streams (even in non-specified Zatsudan streams) and will contain topics that might be too personal or more personal. The list cannot be a replacement for members content nor is it meant to be a replacement, which is why in that case, the description will be a little vague and a full overview for these streams will not be provided. There's also a chance these topics might also end-up in non-members content.

####![Image description](https://files.catbox.moe/f9inkg.png) Membership General Info
The main uptake of the general infos will come from the Membership Opening stream itself
[![【MEMBERSHIP OPENING】I guess you can come in my house, Jailbird~🎼](https://files.catbox.moe/7u77qw.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQaUs-vNgXo)
This section will serve as a tl;dr, although it's still advised to watch the stream itself. Although, the list will be very much the stream recommendation page - it will be evolutive as time goes by. So more informations will be provided.

#####Tiers
There's 3 tiers for the membership:
- Jailbird +
- Jailbird Ultra
- Jailbird Ultra+

Each tier comes with their own price (Jailbird+ being at 4.99$/€, Jailbird Ultra being at 9.99$/€ and Jailbird Ultra+ being at 24.99$/€). A person with a lower tier of membership has the possibility to upgrade to a higher tier.

#####What type of content is expected for Nerissa's mengens and for the membership overall?
So far, there is no difference in content nor perks even in different degrees of membership support. Everybody gets the same emotes to use and gets access to the badges. Everyone joining the membership also has access to the [members special tab](https://www.youtube.com/@NerissaRavencroft/membership) in Nerissa's YouTube page in order to get exclusive updates (membership posts). What may be expected is also ['goodies' as she puts it during the membership opening stream](https://youtu.be/CQaUs-vNgXo?t=1260) so commissioned wallpapers may appear at some point.

As far as streaming content goes, the member streams so far carry a heavy focus on zatsudan, and their quality is regarded by /ope/ anons to be above and beyond that of most of her zatsudan segments in public streams. Membership streams aren't just limited to zatsudan - it can be in fact very varied : it also includes ASMR, karaokes (unarchived and archived), watchalongs, behind-the-scenes special streams (for projects, unique breakdown or musical production), some sporadic gaming streams with members (although specific to some type of games with special permissions).

|2023-09-13 | Zatsudan / Future content planning | 【Members Only~】Let's get to know each other a little better, okay? 🎼[![](https://img.youtube.com/vi/SCvkxYeO2cE/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCvkxYeO2cE) [Thumbnail Source](https://twitter.com/_se_t_/status/1696180839464263858)  |Nerissa's very first Members-only stream and also her very first full-fledged zatsudan, she gives a few details of why is that. Debuts by saying it would be an ordinary zatsudan, it still remains a stream discussing future membership content as she tossed a few ideas for future streams and future member content besides streaming while setting a few expectations for the things to come for the channel as well. As time goes by, she becomes more confident and starts to unwind more easily and filters are progressively coming off while bantering and goofing with chat as a wide array of other subjects was discussed throughout the stream. | ~2h37 |
|2023-09-24 | "Perfect Blue" watchalong, with zatsudan afterwards | 【Members Only~】Watching Perfect Blue together!🎼[![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9B7jYSldNiM/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B7jYSldNiM) [Thumbnail Source](https://twitter.com/yokasparetime/status/1706773225324396711)  |Nerissa's second Members-only stream and also her very first watchalong. "Perfect Blue" is one of her favorite movies that she has rewatched many times. Starts with a 10 minute segment discussing the plan for the stream, followed by the watchalong itself going for ~1h20. After the movie she spent some time discussing it, both other people's and her interpretations of the movie's story. She then went on to have a prolonged zatsudan segment where among other things she discussed some content plans for the near future.  | ~3h30
|2023-10-05 | Zatsudan |【Members Only~】Making plans with just us🎼 [![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RjwJQgrxEgQ/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjwJQgrxEgQ) [Thumbnail Source](https://twitter.com/yomikakisan/status/1708291271515848845)|Nerissa's third Members-only stream, and the first one where she uses her newly purchased mic. This stream several details are discussed about previous streams and projects, some plans and ideas for the upcoming month are also brought up. About halfway into the stream, some spur of the moment decisions are made by Nerissa that result in several powerful vocal treats for the Jailbirds, even further accentuated by the extra clearness and sensitivity of her new microphone. | ~2h34
|2023-10-19 | "The Shining" watchalong |【WATCHALONG】My FIRST TIME watching The Shining🎼 [![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AlpI8Q8KlUU/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlpI8Q8KlUU) [Thumbnail Source](https://twitter.com/_se_t_/status/1708307321905119454) | Nerissa's fourth Members-only stream and second watchalong. She has not seen The Shining previously. Throughout the watchalong Nerissa was munching on some popcorn she prepared beforehand. After the movie ended there was a brief discussion about it between Nerissa and the jailbirds, however the mengen had to be ultimately cut short due to a management meeting Nerissa needed to attend. Nevertheless, she bestowed a gift upon the jailbirds right before ending the stream. | ~3h01
