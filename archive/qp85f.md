## Rused

>"WHAT THE HELL?"
>That's how your day started, and you knew it was going to be a bad day
>It was kinda obvious why
>First, you have one of the greatest migraines in your life
>Second, your Zoro GF was looking at you like you were a ghost type 
"Uh- wha-"
>And third of all, when you lifted your hand to filter the sun coming from the window, there was not a hand, but a gray paw with red claws
>A comically oversized gray paw with red claws
"A- am i still sleeping?" You mutter, still not fully awake
>The impact from the pillow your Zoro gf throws at you was more than enough proof
>You weren't sleeping
>With a swift but clumsy move, you get up and stumble to the nearest mirror
>You already knew what you were going to see, but that small hope inside still got destroyed hard
>You expected a human in the mirror
>Instead, a Zoroark watched you back
"What the hell happened to me?" You ask, trying not to panic (Much)
>"I have no idea!"
"So, i just woke up like this by no reason?"
>"I guess, there's no..."
"WHAT?" You almost screamed, starting to get agitated 
>"I- it can't be that..." 
>A small pause
>"The box you gifted to me, i- i wanted to-"
>That box?
>The puzzle pieces quickly fitted 
>That would explain why yesterday's dessert was sweeter than normal and gave you headaches after a while
>She used the rare candy you got her to cook
>Fucking rare candy of all things
"Please don't tell me..."
>"...yes"
"GOD DAMN" you scream, both panicked and furious, punching the floor 
>What are you going to do? You have an important meeting in less than two days
>After that meeting there was possibly a hefty raise
>And now you can't get out of your home without being captured by other trainers, government agencies, or both
>What about the money? You and her have to eat
>Maybe you can go look for berries? What about the rent? When is the building landlord going to send his goons to kick both you and her out?
>Worse of all, there was no human around, what happens to abandoned Pokémon? Are you and her going to be separated at the shelter? Being put in adoption? Put down?
"Damn..."
>"Are you ok?" She asks, clearly distressed, her ears flat against her head
"I- I just need to think about what to do next, give me a while..."
>She was still in the bed, watching you, clearly sorry about what happened
>Those eyes, you can't be angry with her, it was an accident after all
>Still unsure about what to do, you get back on the bed, trying to clear your mind
>Then, you feel her arm, trying to hug you, while her other paw passed through your mane
>"I'm, so sorry, anon, if I knew this would've happened..."
>Is she sobbing? Yes she is
>Now you feel terrible for screaming 
"Don't worry, we'll find a way to fix this, together" you say, kissing her in the cheek, while holding her paw
>She also kissed you back, but not in the cheek
>What started as something innocent quickly devolved into something else
>A poet would say that "It was the greatest form of love coming from two different worlds, never supposed to be together"
>A normal person would say you rawfucked her during almost an hour, exploring your new "attributes", knotting included
(No sex tho scene, im not good at smut lol)
>All you can say, whoever, is that it was incredible
>After a while of panting and some snarling, both of you collapse in the bed
"Damn, sure that was... interesting"
>"Sure it was, anon, we have to do it again another day, same form" she says, with a smirk
"What do you me-"
>The illusion broke, taking you back to your human form
>... rused yet again by a smooth fox
>She's really good at it
"It feeled so real..."
>"I know, i've been practicing while you go work at that stupid place"
"Shall I remind you that's how I pay this apartment?"
>"Nah, I don't think so..."
>Still, there was something still unanswered 
"So, about the rare candy..."
>"That was actually an accident, but I couldn't just let that opportunity go unused"
"Well..."
>"You really believed eating it would transform you into a Zoroark?"
"...yes"
>"Then i shall consider this little prank a success" she says, proud of herself
>It was in her nature, pranking
>After a while, she speaks again
>"Would you prefer living in the woods with me? No responsibilities, no job, no traffic,  just you and me, two zoroarks living out of berries in the forest..."
>Is that a rhetoric question or is she being serious?
"As long as we're together, I don't see why not"
>Still in bed, you hug her, too tired to be angry at her rusing 
Alt/extended ending
>Maybe it was the illusion messing with your senses, but it was colder than you thinked
>Thankfully you have a soft, furred gf next to you to heat you up
>Her head, over your shoulder, her hot and kinda wet breathing, it was perfect
>"Uhh, anon? There's something wron-"
"Shhh, let me enjoy your fur a while before I have to go work"
>"Sure..." she says, looking at the small patch of grey fur growing in your back
>There's a reason why rare candy is not suggested for humans, and why the small disclaimer in the box says not to get near pokémons in case of "accidental" ingestion
