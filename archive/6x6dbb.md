We all know that (You)r OC has awesome godlike powers, but what if in an alternative universe Instead of godlike witches and wizards, they were actual gods?

What would be their name?

What would be their domain? Would they have multiple domains? (Life? Art? War? Fire? Water? Something else?)

How were they born? Were they forged from steel? Were they born from the tears of a goddess? Were they pooped out by a Rock Giant?

What is their history? How did they become who they are?

What is their duty?

What are their powers?
