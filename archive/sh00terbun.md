School Shooter Redemption by anonymous

>school shooter energy bun
>avoid becoming a gun control statistic and get a cute bf in the process
>super clingy and lovey because he's so lonely
>afternoons that used to be spent idly dreaming up "the list" now filled with using that bunny butt to relieve mutual stress
>or letting him pound a few rounds into you when he's feeling particularly tense
>grades and attitude improve now that he has you in his life
>virtually untouchable because school bullies don't want to be kaczynski'd
>spending nights at his room is weird
>he leaves automatic weapons and ammunition lying around
>meanwhile in public, he acts really confrontational with anybody who doesn’t treat you right
>one time he even held a knife to a guys throat because he bumped into you
>you can’t help but find him adorable
>when you got back to his room, you waded through the unsorted clothing and automatic weaponry to get to his bed
>tonight is going to be great
>go on a date to the laser tag arena he frequents
>his mind goes to that far-off state of concentration you've become used to and is showing off his insane athleticism and speed, hitting targets halfway across the room
>you're not even sure if anyone else *could* get out of the way in time before hearing that jolt and the sensor on the laser tag outfit beeping
>meanwhile he continues to effortlessly jump across the arena while the techno music blares in the background throughout the speakers
>at the end, he stands untouched, having protected you this whole time
>you managed to get one or two strays while he broke his personal record
>after the scores are announced his mind goes back to that shy and quiet personality you are so familiar with, even blushing as the employee at the counter congratulates him
>your bunny bf's tail shakes in embarrassment as you pick out a prize together, only for him to sheepishly say that he won it for you
>the sex that night was even more vigorous than it usually was, you could swear he would never run out of cum as he pumped 6 rounds into you
>another date, you take him to see a movie
>some dumb action movie where a guy’s wife gets taken and he murders his way across the country saving her
>you sit through the whole movie glancing over to him every so often
>he looks adorable, so captured by the movie, his eyes wide with such a look of wonder
>after 2 hours, the movie finally ends and you walk out together
>‘you know, if you ever got kidnapped like that… I’d do like a hundred times more than that guy did!’ He smiles up at you as you walk back
>how is he so god damn cute when talking about literally murdering a city’s worth of people
>that night you decided to get a little spicy and brought a rope with you, asking him to tie your hands behind your back
>he was way too into it, tying the knot with precision before he started teasing at your helpless body
>and honestly, it felt too good, you didn’t want the night to end
>while it finally did end, it was with a belly full of rabbit seed and a satisfied boyfriend rubbing your messy hair
>maybe you should try the kinky stuff with him more often…
