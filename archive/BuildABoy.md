-> *Am I the boy you dreamed of?
Living in your subconscious, oh
Do you believe in love?
And is it because of me?
Yeah, if it's up to me
Am I the boy you dreamed of?
Living in your subconscious, oh
Do you believe in love?
And is it because of me?
Yeah, if it's up to me
Say it all* <-

-> *Build your expectations
Saturated and inflated
'Cause I was born to be your favorite
Make me complicated
I'm modern and I'm dated
Because I was born to be your favorite* <-
-> *Build-A-Boy
Pick my pieces
Overjoyed
Never leave your
Heart destroyed
I'm your boy
Custom-made
Your beloved getaway
I'm your favorite holiday
You'll never be alone with me* <-
