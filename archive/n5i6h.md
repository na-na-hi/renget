If you see a poster with frog avatar or screeching about Windows / "wintards" / "wintroons" or spreading FUD about blobs or dlls, just ignore.
If you see someone posting platitudes about LSD, love, utopia and nazism, report & ignore. <- he also tries to make new threads while removing those last 2 sentences.
