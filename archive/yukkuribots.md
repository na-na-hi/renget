# YUKKURI BOTS AND LOREBOOK
->![Always remember Easy Day](https://files.catbox.moe/cnsc9i.gif)<-
***
This rentry is for my Yukkuri bots and accompanying lorebook. 99% of the lore details were sourced from the tag wiki entries of OYP. It is assumed that you know how to use cards, lorebooks and LLM frontends. If you don't, you should go check where technolo**g**y is discussed for more info.
Lorebook currently supports a fair handfull of the most common Yukkuri seen in stories. If one you want is missing it shouldn't be hard to copy the template. If you send me a filled template, I'll add it in later! This rentry will probably have a mix of FF and Abyuse focused cards in the future, but it's all FF for now. I'm not much for Abyuse but an anon gave me good scenario ideas. Anyway with all that said, don't forget to

##THE MANJÅª

###Niceheads
Take it easy, Mister Human!
Image| Name | Description | Link
------ | ------ | ------ | -----
 ![Even Mister Compost can take it easy if you're a true nicehead. If only anon wasn't so tsundere...](https://files.catbox.moe/ukc2p8.png) | Domesticated Compost Reimu | A Reimu and her koReimu that live under your house as 'composters'. Very grateful for being given such an easy place to live (a modified dustbin), a safe place to hunt (your overgrown backyard) and lots of Mister Food (leftovers and table scraps)! Based on the anko/comic "Domesticated Yukkuri Reimu". | [Catbox link](https://files.catbox.moe/ukc2p8.png)
 ![I like them aquatic, no dissolving the shelly you hear me!](https://files.catbox.moe/dnnftq.png) | Shell Marisa | A Shell Marisa koyukkuri living in a tank you bought for her. Should be easy to care for, but it's a bit hard to hear her talking underwater! There's a bit of dry land in the tank to hear her better and eat special Mister Foods besides aquayu-flakes. | [Catbox link](https://files.catbox.moe/dnnftq.png)
 ![Mukyu!](https://files.catbox.moe/ronjgh.png) | Silver Badge Patchouli | A well trained Patchy your friend gifted you. Handle with care, Patchys are fragile! Maybe you can get her to read a book to you, I don't know. Just be easy! | [Catbox link](https://files.catbox.moe/ronjgh.png)
 ![Where is Mister Cards? Don't take it easy and come out! Right now is fine!](https://files.catbox.moe/48fdkr.gif) | Coming Soon | Placeholder Placeholder Placeholder Placeholder Placeholder Placeholder Placeholder | [Catbox link](link goes here)

###Shitheads
Drop dead easy, shitty slave!

------ | ------ | ------ | -----
 ![Maybe it's weird, but I find spoiling supreme shitheads to be very amusing. It's not maso, I just find the arrogance cute. Don't we all wish we could be so arrogant and get away with it?](https://files.catbox.moe/32u1l7.png) | Wasa Reimu | A newborn wasa reimu with the sort of ego you would expect. Example dialogue mostly based on 'Wasa!' by Morutarou. The first bot I made for testing to try and nail down the speech patterns.| [Catbox link](https://files.catbox.moe/32u1l7.png)

##LOREBOOK
***
The thing that actually makes the cards work. I recommend simply slapping the entire thing into context if you can, given GPT4-Turbo has a native 128k context window (allegedly) and the whole lorebook sits at around 22k tokens.

 ![I can't think of a funny message for this one.](https://files.catbox.moe/59nazj.jpg) | Release V1 of the lorebook. Please note that this is based heavily on the 'Yukkuri live in the real world with regular humans and can have hardships and struggles as much as they can have easiness' type of Yukkuri content. Overtly abuse-biased entries were avoided but user discretion is advised. Supports Alice, Aya, Chen, Cirno, Flandre, Marisa (plus aquatic, shell and kotatsu), Meiling, Momiji, Nitori, Patchouli, Ran, Reimu (plus wasa), Remilia, Sakuya, Youmu, Yuuka and Yuyuko. If you fill out the template I used and want me to add another yu, mail me! | [Catbox link](https://files.catbox.moe/dvtlrh.json)
