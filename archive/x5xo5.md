\>ywn be observed as a natural anomaly
\>ywn be abducted from your home for "government research"
\>ywn be strapped to a table as your mind is wiped of all stressors from before, leaving in its place only a desire for taking and giving cock trained during the mind wiping process
\>ywn gain an overstimulation fetish as body modifications allow cum production that will better keep up with the machines they use for testing
\>ywn be made slowly but surely into the needy slut that the new world needs
\>ywn have your skin replaced surgically with a metal body resemblant of a dragon, your artificially-modified genitals being one of few remainders of your once humanity
\>ywn be displayed in porn as fetish fuel to display the superiority of robots over humans
\>ywn "live" to see the day that humans are placed into a position of subjugation beneath the massive, throbbing, demanding members of their robot overlords

\>ywn be their new king
\>ywn be greeted with a cavalcade of human men all willing to serve and pleasure you and anyone you direct them to
\>ywn conscript them into a life of servitude and subject them to the same process that you went through by hand
\>ywn develop an epicurean court full of former humans with no memories of their humanity
\>ywn develop a level of intimacy akin to Stranger in a Strange Land with all of your court
\>ywn submit yourself to them all as they pile onto you and brutally use your genitals, mouth, and rectum as objects of pleasure rather than divine guidance

\>ywn take one of your court every day at lottery ball random as your daily love
\>ywn subject them to such otherworldly pleasures as gentle, slow sex in the missionary position with a loving top who wants your pleasure more than his
\>ywn go on a gentle walk on the beach with your daily love, sharing a long, wonderful date together
\>ywn cuddle them atop a luxurious bed as you get home, showing them such wholesome pleasures as gentle pecks on the cheek or feeling like nothing could ever possibly hurt them
\>ywn clean them up after gentle, slow sex with jazz music playing in the background
\>ywn cuddle one of your many brides in bed as they ask that this never stop, only to be told "everyone needs this once in a while. You're all special to me and I want you all to feel as you do right now."
\>ywn kiss them on the cheek in the morning as they exit your bedroom, then sit atop a throne constructed by your servants
\>ywn take new requests daily from the outside to convert people into this superior, masquerading lifestyle that never ends and has a host that never dies

\>ywn peter out all of existence, eventually converting your headquarters into a space castle where other intergalactic races may be introduced to your sex cult
\>ywn strip them of all uniqueness to allow them to live simple, pleasure-addled lives beneath you while you handle the burden of intelligence for them
\>ywn eventually conquer entire galaxies this way as eons upon eons pass
\>ywn end as supreme robotic overlord of all space and time, sucking and fucking your subjects in an infinite orgiac society composed of augmented living beings pledging themselves in your name
\>ywn feel truly useful

Why live?
