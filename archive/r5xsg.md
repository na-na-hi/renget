#Orochi's Relationship Chart 2.0

>Fellow Freshmen:

>Chihiro Mitsurugi:
“She is quite a handful. Self sufficient and responsible. She blames herself too much for anything bad that happens around her, tho… Well, we just have to make her get out of the shell.”
Respects and admires Chihiro’s self-reliance, as well as her discipline and martial prowess. Orochi is willing to help her in any problem she has, as long as she can do something for Chihiro. Despite their different natures, Orochi enjoys spending time with Chihiro and Hoge  in their dojo.
Sometime in the future, when opportunity arises, Orochi wants to take Chihiro on a tour around Atsushi's mansion, she may like it.

>Imai:
“He is very reliable. Well, our skills are too much of a mismatch for us to work on anything around combat in class, but he is an enjoyable person to be around. Heh? He admires me? Hey! You are pulling my leg here!”
Respects Imai’s determination to become a hero despite the social prejudice against him, and finding him a smart person like Chris. They may not talk much, but Orochi doesn’t mind if he calls her to hang out or go to the arcade.

>Bobby:
“Bobby is quite good and damn, is he witty. I’ll beat that punch barrage… mark my words.”
They are starting their friendship, due to the strange fact they haven’t interacted much for the rest of the year. As a fellow delinquent, she finds his antics quite fun, even when she cannot join in the tomfoolery.
Orochi respects his capacity to stay low and hold back his fighting ability behind a slacking persona. (She wants to fight him in earnest to see how far both can go in a serious fight)

>Kaylee:
“Oh, it is you, she-gorilla.”
Despite them always starting a conversation or interaction on the wrong foot, Orochi holds Kalyee in high esteem as her rival and should she call for backup, Orochi will come to repay the favor and save her.
Due to a certain incident, Orochi wants to train harder, to not be beaten again, and to be able to help Kaylee should the situation arise.
This won’t stop her from sliding snarky remarks and teasing when talking to Kaylee. Also, it is quite good that Kaylee “solved” her issues with the KBA.

>Shinkan:
“Quite impulsive, but he appears to be a nice guy.”


>Korean Bitch Army:
“They are not so bad… Well, not too much.”
Her opinion over the KBA rose by several orders of magnitude. While Orochi doesn’t have an easy time talking with them, she isn’t against them anymore. Maybe if they start to spend more time together.

>Noah
“Hi Noah. Can you pick my pencil over that tree? One of my tails threw it there.”
Orochi feels more at ease around him nowadays, with a better judgment of what or not to do around the angel boy. His antics with Sally are cute, but it is such a shame she can’t tease them… Noah would explode, and so would Sally…

>Victor Sigurd:
“It is such a shame he was transferred.”
While his transfer to another class doesn’t stop her from trying to hang out with him, it does throw a possible wrench towards his future. At least in her eyes, he could make a splendid hero. Such is life. 

>Inigo:
“... (half tempted to ramp up her venom to spit on his face). Okay, Inigo. We can go hangout. Call Hoge too.”
While some of his antics can be annoying, he somehow manages to snare her in tomfoolery, which is hilarious most of the time. Her opinion over him rose the most out of the entire class, with Orochi considering him one of her closest friends in Shinketsu. Surprisingly, she isn’t aware about his past or antics outside of the school.
Should Inigo need help with his antics, Orochi is willing to help behind the scenes, to not get tracked back to Inigo (Unless Chris is involved, then she would try her best to avoid the tomfoolery)

>Hoge:
“Hi Hoge! Are you going to Chihiro’s dojo? Can I come with you?”
Despite Orochi’s difficulty in keeping track of Hoge in the past, she finds Hoge enjoyable to be around and to tease, as  someone with problems brought by their own quirk, Orochi finds Hoge’s problems to be relatable to a certain degree.
The best thing about her is how easy she is to tease and the cute reactions (Although Hoge can just disappear if Orochi teases too much).
Their “bounding” back in the Mitsurugi dojo is a great source of teasing to both Hoge and Sally.

>Chris:
“You know I’ll beat you in the arcade. Huh? You think you can defeat me? How cute. As you go, I’m coming back from my journey!”
To her, Chris is the only one able to rival her abilities in the arcade. While most people can’t keep up with her, Chris can do it, and even defeat her! They are polar opposites— Her being brash, loud and quite a handful to deal with, while he is cold, introverted and snarky.
Despite it all, they somehow work together as friends. Orochi holds Chris in high esteem, having an admiration over the fact he stuck with her, waiting in the hospital when she was injured and keeping her company. 

>Held back:


>Yui:
“Hahaha. You are getting better at arcades, but you will have to train for another thousand years to achieve my level!”
Her best friend, and partner in crime. A time around Yui is guaranteed to be a good one. Be it fighting other delinquents, sparring, or playing at the arcade, Yui alongside Chris are her first calls for a hang out.
Orochi feels bad over letting Yui see how badly Feral had beaten her up. She knows that Yui won’t mind or let it slow her down, but Orochi can’t help but feel bad over the gore scene Yui and Chris had seen…

>Hiro:
“A strange guy but he ain’t bad. Although it is strange when he asked me about how toxic my blood is. You can’t just come to a gal and ask where her blood stands in a toxicity chart!”
Doesn’t have strong opinions over him, but much like Imai, respects his choice to be a hero instead of a villain due to his quirk.

>Transferred Students:
>Sally:
“She was a bitch at first, not going to lie about that, but well, I was one towards her too. Should’ve learned a bit of tact as of now. She isn’t a bad girl, nor a bad friend.”
Orochi was a bitch to her when she entered in response to Sally being a bitch to Orochi because Orochi is filthy rich. Jokes aside, they are in a far better spot regarding their “friendship” in comparison to where they started.
Bridging their  differences and strengthening their friendship is on Orochi’s immediate plans for the future.

>Takara:
“Hey, I’m sorry about not being able to hang out with you… haha… sorry.”
As someone very different from the norm on the inside, Orochi holds a sense of kinship with Takara. Orochi planned to take her out to the arcade on the Monday after school, but an incident happened…
There is always another chance, right? Besides that, Orochi finds Takara searching for friends pleasant and fun, and has no problem with being friends with the Android.

>Seniors:
>Nene:
“Hadn’t much of a chance to interact with her, but Yui and Chris seemed to like her. So she isn’t a bad person”.
Couldn’t interact with her much for some reason, but wants to based on Yui and Chris’ opinions over her.

>Mio:
“Who let this sassy child into Shinketsu?!”

>Teachers:


>Rosethorn:
“I still don’t like her, but she isn’t so bad..”
Orochi still doesn’t like Rosethorn, but she can use her abilities as a hero and teacher. While some clashes may happen from time to time, Orochi is willing to concede and admit defeat regarding Rosethorn’s views and opinions.

>Ippon:
“He is a good teacher, I like his class.”
The fact that he is a judoka and teaches self defense makes him one of her two favorite teachers. This is boosted due to her fighting style which revolves around being close and personal to the enemy. Coming to know how to better her style while having a teacher who is good at what he does makes his class the best.
She heard he entered some brawls with a Villain, with two seniors by his side. While not knowing the exact details, he is even more cool due to those events.

>Masamori:
“He scares me.”
Something she rarely says but this one is warranted. His quirk is too scary even to a mutant like her, the sheer level of atrocity he is capable of bringing feels her heart with fright, especially when she thinks of the damage her own bodily fluids could bring if refined or brought out of control.
Due being of a Hero family, she knows that the Hero industry isn’t as clean as it sells itself out to be and this fact fills her heart with paranoia around Masamori.

>Majestic
“Oh, Majestic-Shishou! I was waiting for your class!”
The contender against Ippon as the best teacher and best class. Her entire childhood and early teenage years were around tough love, especially due to the brawls she started, so his class is like a taste of nostalgia. The fact that he is self aware of his age and is training the new generation because of that makes him gain more respect points.
She is willing to give him the benefit of doubt before accusing him, either on the internet or around her colleagues, choosing to not believe rumors until concrete proof is shown.
While concrete proof still has to be shown, he isn’t a bad person, right? He defeated a villain Kaylee was holding back.

>Pro Heroes:

>Saurus:
“If I wasn’t going to my cousin’s agency, I would like to work with him.”
As a fellow scaly hero, she likes Saurus despite his more “explosive” temperament. Learning wrestling moves and grappling would also greatly enhance her fighting ability (And how fast she could poison someone by simply holding them)

>Honoken:
“I heard she was in Yuusei’s class back in the day. She must be pretty good then. She is in his agency? Even better! Imagine what type of juice gossip we can get out of them. Maybe they are together?”
Due to being a friend of Yuusei and in his ex classmate, Orochi wants to meet her and of course, test the waters to see if she and Yuusei have something more (Or just make the most awkward moment for both of them)

>Villains:

>Karma:
“That bitch has to pay, but I know now there are bigger things than Atsushi's pride. Things which are far worse…”

>Feral:
“... Ahhh.”
Despite not wanting to show her weakness to anyone but her family, it is hard to think  deeply about Feral and what she did without shivering or being brought to tears by the darkest moment of her life. Harder still is to hold back these feelings when her friends are around, and she is reminded of what happened.

>Desolator:
“Just know the rumors, he did a number on Chris. The KBA somehow got their hands in all kinds of gossip, this is one of them. While I can’t say for sure, if Chris went to face him, it must be for a good reason.”
Extremely dangerous and the type of foe she has the worst chemistry with, avoid at all costs.

>Family:

>Yuusei:
“Hi… Yuusei. Haha, I’m sorry, I wasn’t good enough. I’m sorry…”
Without others to worry about and to keep a facade, Orochi is ready  to just collapse on her cousin’s and cry to her heart's content. The visage of Feral and what she did was too much for her.
Orochi also doesn’t want for him to be hurt or blame himself for not taking Feral out on that day, it wasn’t his fault, he shouldn’t hold himself accountable for it.

>Yamamoto (Father):
“Father… I want to be strong. Stronger than I was. I want to be strong enough to protect people. I want to be strong enough to be a true hero!”
A caring, carefree but still strict father. He raised Orochi with a more loose hand than his wife, his fighting style and carefree personality being the base for his daughter’s own style. He is fond of joking and partying, helping others deal with bad moods or sadness, a trait she tries to replicate.
Although someone carefree, Yamamoto still is someone worthy of being a branch family’s head. Someone who knows to be strict and cruel if needed, something Orochi can’t be yet, nor wants to be. 
Despite all of this, she knows how strong her father is, even after retiring as a hero, she knows he will make her strong, it will be rough and probably painful, but such is the price to get rid of her own weakness.

>Nabiki (Mother)
“Mother, I am sorry. I want… I want us to get along.”
Despite their misgivings and problems, after almost dying, Orochi wants to get close to her mother again. She plans to start using all of those traditional kimono dresses she got as gifts all these years ago.
The first step has already been made. What she needs to do is make up and try her best to forgive her mother’s actions, and go beyond these memories and the pain. 
>Akane (Older sister):
“Hey… Akane-nee. I… I…”
Much like her cousin, she won’t hold back if she gets the chance to be with her sister. For most of her life, her older sister spoiled her rotten, the news of the hospitalization and fight must have taken a great toll in Akane’s mind and spirit, to almost lose a younger sister without any warning…
Orochi doesn’t want to burden Akane with her own pain and worries but in face of what  happened, she can’t hold the memories and fear back when in the safe haven her sister represents.

>Kyoko (Younger sister):
“Hey, Kyo, your sister is okay, look? I’m whole, there is no need to be so scared of losing me. I am strong.”
Like how Akane spoiled her, Orochi likes to spoil her youngest sister, although being rougher than her eldest sister. Playing fight, taking her to arcades, feeding her sweet tooth and letting Kyoko sleep with her despite being a twelve year old already.
For her, Orochi puts up a brave front even when she wants to break down inside her room and do nothing for an entire day, waiting for her older sister to come or her friends. For her little sister, Orochi has to be strong and not let her insecurities appear…
