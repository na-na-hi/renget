>anon has been dodging marriage assignment like every senator dodged the draft
>"sorry i didn't get the mail" and skipping town only works so many times 
>the fines are piling up too
>maybe its time to finally leave the city for good
>hes known there were human supremacist cells that would probably be willing to take him in
>he found someone who was in and started talking to them recently
>they call themselves segregationists or separatists
>they don't seem much like whats on the news 
...
>anon gets his next assignment letter and skips out of town for good, joins separatists in the hills
>they pressure him into pulling some stunt 
>Literally planting bombs 
OR
>they know the media will cause more fear mongering which they want so they just have anon plant fake bombs and let news crooks spin a story 
>gets caught
>gets interrogated by a bigass bear
>he cant handle being yelled at by a giant aggressive predator
>completely shatters, talks (a lot)
>between being highly cooperative and tapes of anon being pitiful in the interrogations the judge is extremely merciful
>rehab instead of jail
>all that stuttering and crying like a bitch makes it obvious anon is not a hardened terrorist
>he is assigned some kind of domestic dog as a councilor and psychiatrist 
>doesn't talk the first session, sullen
>second session he isn't talking again
>councilor is going through his record 
>whole lot of infractions when he was in that boys home
"i didn't do that stuff"
>wont elaborate
>very cagey
>third session
>councilor sits on the couch next to him instead of at her desk, too close
>tries to talk more about the boys home
>flashback ptsd moment 
>he can smell the stale mold of the couch
>he can hear the noisy buzzing of the old fluorescent lights 
>the sour musk of his caretaker
>hes back in the boys home
>councilor put her hand on his shoulder, not sure why hes so tight and strung up
>he flinches and tries to elbow her in the process but she easily blocks it
>this was a very bad move
"I'M SORRY I'M SORRY"
>he whimpers 
>this was an even worse mistake
>she loves the noises he makes 
>she's said so herself many times 
>she will use anything available to draw out those "cute little noises"
>belts
>claws
>a cigarette a few times 
>teeth
>something causes anon to snap out of it, maybe something the councilor did
>hes no longer in the boys home with his abusive caretaker
>hes back in the relative safety of the rehab facility
>in those short few moments he's already sweat through his clothes 
>hes clenching his jaw so hard his teeth hurt
>there's an iron lump the size of a cannon ball in his stomach and its threatening to come up
>he cant get a full breath
>eventually he calms down
>councilor asks who miss \[caretaker] is, he said that name a few times
>hes not in any state to continue
>maybe she offers him a barbiturate which kicks off future drug abuse in the story 
>later sessions he starts opening up slightly
>caretaker would make up infractions so that she had a reason to "punish" him
>these went on his permanent record
>between his rap sheet and the trauma causing him to be phobic of all anthros, especially predators, especially especially canines its not surprising that he ended up on that path that he did
>shes a little hurt that he hates canines but understands
>she asks if he would like to be transferred to a herbivore councilor and is silently relieved when he declines 

>somehow anon gets put on the suicide watch list 
>maybe a separatist landed himself in the same facility and slashes anons arm with a shaving razor and frames a suicide attempt 
>councilor now has to watch him whenever hes not doing group activities or sleeping
>including showering
>anon is very against this but ultimately is coerced to shower
>when he disrobes before her she sees the extent of what his caretaker did
>cigarette burns
>claw marks
>other indistinct marks that only a seasoned sadist or forensic pathologist could categorize
>a massive, gnarly, full head of teeth bite mark on his shoulder and neck
>looks like it was not once, but reapplied multiple times 
>councilor better understands the full extent of his childhood abuse 
>she has anon write some statements and sign some reports regarding his caretaker
>anon starts opening up eventually
>starts getting better but has a long way to go
>time passes
>those statements he wrote nearly a year ago are bearing fruit
>the reports lead to a investigation. other victims were tracked down and questioned 
>turns out the state has been turning a blind eye to this abuse for over a decade
>massive court case 
>prosecutor thinks anon could be the star witness, gets pushy and tries to guilt trip him to take active involvement in the case
>anon is not emotionally capable of taking on this burden. thankfully the court system is very lenient towards humans because of chauvinist beliefs that boys are weak. they allow his statements to be entered into evidence without his direct testimony because he is adjudicated incapable 
>apparently he was caretaker's favorite 
>this is all very hard on him
>maybe kick off the drug abuse line if that was seeded earlier
>media is incessant about interviews 
>he tries to go to he hearings for closure and healing
>he just ends up staring at his abuser 
>medias are relentless
>pushing microphones and cameras into his face, offers to pay for interviews
>they even send representatives with snazzy phrases telling him he can build his own anti-abuse "brand". he can stop abuse and get rich and famous at the same time
>councilor tries to shield him as much as possible but its hard 
>court case ends
>caretaker was made an example of
>state wants to save face for turning a blind eye to the abuse
>people are out for blood
>anon is still in the center of it, forced into celebrity status 
i don't know where to go from here
