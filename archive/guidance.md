-> this is filled with basic rentry help and a few cool
things ive learned when making rentries myself
**[pixels](/masqueradeball)** + **[stamps and blinkies](/scrapbooks)**<-
***
***
***
***
# Header 1
 ## Header 2
### Header 3
#### Header 4
##### Header 5
###### Header 6
-> `# Header 1`
`## Header 2`
`### Header 3`
`#### Header 4`
`##### Header 5`
`###### Header 6`
**NOTE** if aligning a header make sure you put # before align marks
or it will not align how you want... **example code: `# -> Header 1 ->`**<-
***

###### TEXT STYLES
**check both dark and light mode to make sure your rentry looks good!**
**bold** `**bold**`
*italics* `*italics* `
~~strike~~ `~~strike~~`
***bold italics*** `***bold italics***`
invisible character `"ㅤ"`
the lines you see are created by doing a singular `***` or `----` on one row
\> ㅤ if you need to... you can click the edit button to see how a rentry is 'coded'
***

###### LINK STYLES
[link](/clicked) `[link text](url here)`
[link](/clicked "extra info in quotes" ) || `[link](url here "extra info in quotes" )`
**[link](/clicked)** `**[link text](url here)**`
*[link](/clicked)* `*[link text](url here)*`
~~[link](/clicked)~~ `~~[link text](url here)~~`
***[link](/clicked)*** `***[link text](url here)***`

[**`if you bold text here it is red`**](/clicked) || ```[**`if you bold text here it is red`**](url here)```

[`if you don't its blue!`](/clicked) || ```[`if you don't its blue!`](url here)```

**note:** if you are *redirecting to another rentry* the url can be only after a slash for example `/rentryurl` - if its another url, however, you need a proper link
***
***
***
###### HIGHLIGHT STYLES
==highlight== `==highlighted text==`
[==highlight==](/clicked)** `[==highlighted text==](link)`
~~==highlight==~~ `~~==highlighted text==~~`
*==highlight==* `*==highlighted text==*`
==**highlight**== `==**highlighted text**==` (for some reason this one doesnt work for me with the `**` outside the highlight marks?
***==highlight==*** `***==highlighted text==***`
==`highlight`==  ``==`highlight`==``
***
***
***
###### CHECKBOXES
- [ ] open checkbox
- [x] closed checkbox

`- [ ] open`
`- [x] closed`
i personally think these are good to use for byfs...
***
***
***
###### ALIGNMENT
type `->EXAMPLE<-` for the centered content
type `->EXAMPLE->` for the right-aligned content
->CENTER<-
->RIGHT->
***
***
***
###### COLOURED BOXES
!!! info
    "info" after !!! for blue

!!! note
    "note" after !!! for green

!!! warning
    "warning" after !!! for yellow

!!! danger
    ""danger"" after !!! for red

`!!! put the "danger" or whateevr colour u want here... u dont need to put a title or text`
no title or text leaves you with
!!! danger
for example

###### IMAGES
![uzui from demon slayer](https://i.imgur.com/oKfgZso.jpg)
`![image description](image link)`
you can see image descriptions when you hover (desktop) or press and hold (mobile)
so if you don't want to put anything leave it blank "[]"
**note: images can not be resized** ***IN RENTRY*** - you need to use an *external* image editing app
***
***
***
###### LINKED IMAGES
[![uzui from demon slayer](https://i.imgur.com/oKfgZso.jpg)](/clicked)
`[![image description](image link)](WEBSITE LINK)`
if a rentry url you can just add the url section as `(/RENTRYURL)`
if not a rentry url; you would need the whole address `(https://twitter.com/)`
***

###### EMOJIS
you can add emojis into rentries :heart: = `:heart:`
a full emoji list can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908)

***USEFUL WEBSITES***
https://www2.lunapic.com/editor/?action=edge-fade & https://www.quickpicturetools.com/en/blur_edges/ can be used to blur edges of images
https://www2.lunapic.com/editor/?action=quick-crop can be used to crop images
https://www2.lunapic.com/editor/?action=scale can be used to resize images
https://imagecolorpicker.com/en is really good for picking hex code colours... idk what you'd use it for on rentry but its good <3
**p.s** can you tell lunapic is basically my bible....

***GENERAL TIPS***
- [ ] make sure your rentry looks how you want it to on both **mobile** and *desktop*
- [x] max image length i personally go to is 350px that makes it look good on both mobile and desktop for me...!
- [ ] upload **any** images you are using to imgur or an image hosting site! ive found out the hard way that if youre using pixels from carrd and that carrd is deleted than you wont be able to see your pixels on the rentry anymore....
