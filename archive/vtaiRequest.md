!!! info List Info
	This is a comprehensive list of each LoRA request made on the Request Anchor from a span of a year that have been forgotten and/or ignored, while I can understand LoRA makers not wanting to make every single requested chuuba thats requested in the thread, I still felt like I'd give them a chance by highlighting what was missed, if I missed something by accident, DO LET ME KNOW IN THE THREAD. Not every anon has time to archive rep. If you feel like not doing /vtai/ specific requests, you still have the LoRA checklist to shift through in the Navigation Bar. Thank you - Inanon

!!! warning QUICK NOTE
	YOU AREN'T FORCED TO DO ONE MODEL OVER ANOTHER, IF YOU ONLY WANT TO DO 1.5, ANIMAGINE OR PONY, THEN DO WHICH ONE YOU ARE MORE COMFORTABLE WITH. I just wrote what the original request wanted if specified in the post.
!!! info Disclaimer for requesters!
	Please provide a dataset to speed up potential request completion, dataset collection can be a slow and annoying part of cooking up loras for other people so if you want to see your request fulfilled, doing that for our great lora makers can help a ton.
