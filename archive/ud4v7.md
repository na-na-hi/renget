Standing at the grocery store checkout, you nervously stand at the side of Sora as she finishes her purchases. You tap your feet in anticipation as it seems the cashier is taking their time, almost in what seemed to be a deliberately slow manner to torture you.

Every once in a while you catch her sending a side-glance in your direction, checking out your body with that familiar predatory glint in her eyes. You shivered internally as you just stared at the floor to avoid anymore eye contact.

As the cashier finished scanning the items and Sora handed over the yen, she gave a small smile and thanked the cashier in her usual cutesy manner. You noticed he blushed in response, the average reaction you’d get from being praised by an idol.

But you’ve seen her true nature. Behind that stalwart façade she put on everyday for everyone in her life. To her fans, her coworkers and to her company, she was the seiso idol Tokino Sora. A pure maiden that loved to sing and dance, play Minecraft and help her kouhais. But to you, she was something completely different.

You and Sora walk out of the store, timidly walking just behind her with her groceries in your hand until she stops in front of a nearby alleyway. You stop as well, knowing exactly what she wanted to do. She partially tilted her head backwards and you saw that grin and look of excitement.

Without even saying anything you obediently went into the alley with her following close behind. Once you were a bit down the alley she suddenly grabbed you and held you in place. You felt her breath on your neck while feeling her breasts press against your back. 

“The way you were looking back there… that timid look you had… it turned me on so much,” she said with pure lust on her voice.

Sora reached down directly into your pants and began to fervently stroke your cock with one hand while the other reached to unbuckle your belt.

You could only do what she wanted. You had no choice. Even though she was smaller than you, even though she couldn’t physically overtake you…

She had all the power over you.

The idol pulled down your pants and you felt the cold of the night air assault you as you shivered. Sora let go of you dick and slipped down her skirt and panties to reveal her cleanly shaven pussy. She walked in front of you and placed her hands against the wall and propped her ass up.

“Come on… you know what’ll happen if you don't, right?” she said with a smug across her lips and manic look in her eyes.

You knew.

All you had worked for would crumble.

You had worked so hard to get a job at Hololive so you could get a chance to interact with the idols you adored so much. But you knew the reality of the situation. You could be easily replaced.

And who’d take the word of some random guy over the picturesque idol Tokino Sora? 

You dropped the groceries and pushed forward, inserting your cock into Sora’s pussy, the girl moaning as you saw the look on her face turn even more wild. The pleasure you felt was intense as you kept pounding her from behind, but that little voice in the back of your head kept telling you that this was wrong.

“Dont… just fuck me, grab.. my tits!” she said between gasps and moans. You could only obey as you reached forward and began fondling the idols breasts, kneading them exactly how she instructed in order to give her maximum pleasure.

It was all about her after all.

Everything was.

You continue to fuck Sora until she’s climaxed so many times that you lost count, her smaller body spassing every so often as you hit her every pleasure point. You were at your limit as well, but you couldn’t stop until she said so.

You had to obey every command.

“Cum…” was all she said and you knew. By her command you released your seed inside of her and you both shuddered. For a few moments, you both just stood there and panted as you pulled out, you cum dripping everywhere.

But quickly she regained her senses and pulled up her underwear and pants as if nothing had happened. She walked past you, that innocent idol look returning to her face as she passed

“Don’t forget the groceries,” was all she said as she left the alley. You zipped up your pants and quickly grabbed the bags before catching up to her.

You couldn’t disobey, after all.
