# Games by /gedg/

Make sure to provide some kind of evidence that it was made by a /gedg/ poster. Examples can include any of the following:

* Reference to /gedg/ in the game description.
* Referencing /gedg/ in a README or another kind of doc if the game is open source.
* Linking to posts made during dev. A good archive website for this kind of thing is https://desuarchive.org/.
* Having dev that was posted on /gedg/ that is well known by the posters of /gedg/.

Of course, game jam entries should be added to the list of games without any fuss. /agdg/ events are included here because of cross-posters. Entries that are submitted to /agdg/ events that have also appeared on /gedg/ posters will be listed.
