#Very Short Writefag about Magnus running in the desert

A juggernaut made of steel walks across the desert wastes, the dreadnought of an armor cutting a clear shape in the vast expanses of sand. His form is fearsome and imposing, a beast standing at 7’9 ft tall.

Contrary to its huge shape and divine armor, the giant of metal runs in a steady pace, a view many would think to be unnatural or a mirage. The colossal featurelessness of the open fiends of the arid wastes doing no favors to hide the warrior, yet it wasn’t needed in the slightest. The frightening pace of his run and armor being enough to scare beasts and petty thieves into riding. The mighty cannon on his left arm worked in tandem with the armor as a deterrent to any threat near him.

Inside of the ancient armor, the warrior inside hadn’t shown at sight of tiredness or discomfort despite his steady run in the middle of the desert. Against all appearances, the insides of the armor being held at a “comfortable” temperature, being made of ancient magics long forgotten to men and beast, the mark of one of a kind in the Wastelands.

Even in his run, the warrior’s mind is clear of troubles or doubts. One shouldn’t have doubts when crossing through dangerous lands. There are many things he needs to think about— check within himself for truthfulness and pray for good tidings. However time is not right for praying and thinking, time will not be right while he stays in dangerous lands and while he has a mission. 

A runner had told him: “Great Warrior, a village in the south west is in dire need of help, a wave of mutant beasts coming near them. Please, help us!”

Choosing to believe the man, he parted ways with haste after analyzing a crude map. Despite adversities, the God-Armor will guide his path, its arcane workings protecting him from the overwhelming heat of the desert and from the wrath of Radtion. There is no time to waste nor spare.

Any beast or petty raider who stops him in his quest, will be felled by the Wrath of Ramus, as will any abomination crawled from the pits of Radtion. Even with him running at the best of his capacity, it would take time to reach the village. With enough luck, he would reach them when nearing the Nightfall. Sadl, there weren’t  many vehicles capable of supporting the weight of a God-Armor, the only option available being to run towards the village by himself.

The only hope in the Warrior’s heart is to reach them in time, before any beast can have their way in the village.
