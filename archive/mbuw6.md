#Caught in the Act!

In the end Inigo went ahead after Sandatsu had told him that he needed to hit the showers before the bell rang.

After this small relief however, Sandatsu's school day had been nothing but failures. Lack of sleep, combined with having spent all night fighting against a vigilante that was tough as nails, rendered the boy in zombie-like state. There hadn't been a single class he didn't mess up, or exercise he hadn't failed.

The bell finally rang again, and he made his way out of the classroom, destination: his tent. No stops.

He could already see the tent, just a few meters ahead. His little oasis, where he could rest and forget about the *many* troubles that plagued his life.

*"..."*

*"...ait up man!"*

Sandatsu thought he heard someone talking, but with his brain mushi as it was everything sounded as if he was underwater.

*"I said wait bro!"* said Inigo, catching up to him, with the small dragon, Gigan, perched on his shoulder *"You left your stuff back in the classroom man! What's up with you today? You have been out of it the entire day..."*

Inigo had intercepted Sandatsu right in front of his tent, and the noise that the blonde boy made had awakened something that was resting inside...

*"Huh? Wha-"* Sandatsu was interrupted by the sound of the zipper being opened from inside the tent. Both boys stared at it, as Mio Katsuragi poked her head out of the ten.

*"Hey, sorry for falling asleep..."* said the girl, yawning *"I was so tired after last night that I-"*

Mio finally came to her senses, seeing the boy standing besides Sandatsu. 

A few seconds passed. Mio was speechless, completely taken by surprise. Inigo stood silent. Sandatsu could barely stand on his feet.

Then he felt something on his shoulder. It was Inigo's hand. He turned his head and saw him and Gigan smiling, both giving him thumbs up.

*"I see... Goog going Sandy... I'll leave you to it then..."* said the blonde boy before quickly taking off.

Another second passed and Mio finally snapped out of her trance.

*"What are you doing you idiot?!  We need to catch him! He ***saw me here***!"* shouted the girl.

Mio's voice made Sandatsu act. He grabbed her and held her under one of his arms, like a football, with her facing backwards, and chased after Inigo, who had put a decent distance between them already.

*"At least have the decency to carry me like a normal person you retard!"* complained his senpai.

Sandatsu's mind was all over the place. Everything around him was moving and shifting, like a mirage. He knew he could grab Inigo if he used 「Branching Grasp」, but when he tried to focus on the quirk certain images suddenly came to his mind. The moment when he had killed Himegawa Rio, the target of his first mission as a trainee enforcer. Sandatsu was so tired that he had trouble keeping his mind focused on reality.

His delusion reached a point where it started to overlay itself on what he was seeing around them. The arms reaching for the helpless student, even though he hadn't activated the quirk. Only this time that student wasn't Himegawa Rio, it was Inigo.

The quirk reaper stopped running and stood still.

*"Hey if you are going to stop at least put me down you animal"* said Mio, struggling to escape form Sandatsu's grasp.

He let go of her.

*"Nice job letting him run away idiot"* said Mio, trying to fix her hair after it had been messed up during the chase.

*"It was your fault..."* said Sandatsu.

*"What did you say?!"*

Sandatsu fell silent. At first he thought that had been Mio's quirk messing with his mind. But deep down he knew that wasn't the case. Mio stared at her brooding companion for a bit before speaking again.

*"Hmm... I totally thought you were going to say that I am too heavy or something like that..."*

*"Nah your figure is pretty great."* blurted out Sandatsu, barely aware of what he had just said because of the sleep deprivation.

*"Ugh. Gross. Revolting. I don't wanna get compliments from you ever."* responded her senpai *"Anyway, just bring him and anyone he talked about this to me and I'll fix it."*

Sandatsu didn't asnwer.

*"Didn't you hear me you animal? I said-"*

*"No."* said the boy.

*"What the fuck are you saying to for? If rumors start then-"*

*"It'll be fine. He's my friend and I have decided to trust him."*

*"You are such a moron..."* said Mio.

Sandatsu had made his decision. Not only had he vowed not to have Mio alter the memories of those he considered his friends, but he also decided to tell them the truth. Maybe not all of it, at least not for now. He could start by telling them about his quirk, but no way he was getting into the topic of enforcement yet.

He made his choice. He would tell his friends the truth behind his quirk. After a good night's sleep, of course.
