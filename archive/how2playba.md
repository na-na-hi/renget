How to play the game for the completely retarded. Releasing small updates from time to time. 
Scroll to the bottom for my last edit date.

[TOC] 

##Top Tips 
- Match colours
- Read the story (it's fun) 
- Rush through normal missions to unlock cafe upgrades and game modes 
- Take advantage of the school bonuses in Bounties, and use CC
- Join a club (you don't have to talk) 

## Downloading/Setting up the game

JP - [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.YostarJP.BlueArchive&hl=en_US&gl=JP&pli=1) | [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/%E3%83%96%E3%83%AB%E3%83%BC%E3%82%A2%E3%83%BC%E3%82%AB%E3%82%A4%E3%83%96/id1515877221) | [QooApp](https://apps.qoo-app.com/ja/app/12252)

Global - [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nexon.bluearchive&hl=en_US&gl=US) | [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blue-archive/id1571873795) | [QooApp](https://apps.qoo-app.com/en/app/12252)

Global may require a VPN to play, as it is region-locked. JP is region-locked as well, so if you wish to play it use a VPN. The only server to avoid would be Korea's server as raids are much, much, MUCH more competitive there than any other, leading to a potentially very detrimental experience. Otherwise, pick whichever you want and you will be fine.

You can play the game through emulators such as [Nox](https://www.bignox.com/), [Bluestacks](https://www.bluestacks.com/bluestacks-5.html), [Memu](https://www.memuplay.com/) or [LDPlayer](https://www.ldplayer.net/). Make sure to crank up the memory allocation as well. 

 If you want the game in something like "tablet mode" (which lets you see more of the screen (some visuals are cut off at default resolution)), consider changing your emulator to the resolution 1440x1080

For comparison:
!["Resolutions](https://i.imgur.com/1Zekisx.jpg)

As an aside, payment options can be dodgy on JP if you want to be a whale depending on your region/your payment account's region. These situations are more complicated. Ask about them in the thread.

### Game crashes and fixes 
This will mostly cover emulator only problems. 

If you experience crashes while playing the game, you should fiddle around in the settings menu. Try the following one at a time:
- Adjust CPU/Memory allocation to High (e.g. 4 Cores and 4 GB respectively) 
- Lower in-game framerate and quality 
- Switch between software and hardware decoding 

Disclaimer: I use Bluestacks 5. See [this for common fixes for Bluestacks](https://support.bluestacks.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413392952461-Recommended-settings-for-Blue-Archive-on-BlueStacks-5).
You can always switch emulators if nothing works.

## (Re)rolling
Your very first roll guarantees a single (3\*) student from a pool of *only* [the release roster](https://bluearchive.wiki/wiki/Characters) (students released on 2021/02/04).
Rolling in 10s guarantees at least one (2\*) student, unlike with singles, so it's better to roll in multis.
If you have no interest in the current banner student(s) use the Regular Recruitment banner, as all pick-up rates will be the same.

**Spend *all* your rolls after the first mission. After that you can reroll.**
I'd also advice to do the same even if you don't reroll, just so you have something to work with. 

The Startdash banner is a new account banner that guarantees a 3* (if you buy the ticket with real money). 

>What are good units to roll for?
Made by /bag/:
![Reroll targets](https://i.imgur.com/86EZJd0.png)

Being farmable means you can unlock the student by farming her node(s) for a long period of time. See [this section](https://rentry.org/how2playba#farmable-units) for more. 

Or alternatively (not made by /bag/):
![Reroll targets](https://i.imgur.com/GdmwgEY.png)
Roll until you get 10 points (this is a JP reroll list)

As the meta is constantly changing, the most optimal reroll targets can change as well.
The [Future Content Timeline and Unit Ratings](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VSzm_ioCt2AdRvkfL9HKNNZSbyslayVERXxVxR6nzh4/edit#gid=616626271) and [Raid Strategy Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bvYGwIh-9o-2JQ4Q2MQXtsL0peiCPrRuw0l3HQmTrZ0/edit#) spreadsheets can help a lot in this regard.
You can always ask /bag/ for advice. 

>What about good units who are only blue or gold (1 or 2 star)?
![Good 1/2 Star Students](https://i.imgur.com/GKg29v0.png)

>Should I reroll?
For your waifu? Of course. But besides that? 

Rerolling makes the game easier, but the game is pretty easy as is. It's like going from normal difficulty to easy. 
I personally didn't reroll and don't recommend it, but I have the advantage of being a day 1 player (and a dolphin that buys the monthlies). The reward for having a fully meta roster is also pretty negligible (3 extra rolls from raids every month and maybe 10 extra rolls if you're rank 1 pvp). 

>How do I reroll? (global only) 
![How to reroll](https://i.imgur.com/t3kHH0w.png)
Menu Tab (top right) > Account > Reset account
For JP the method is outlined [here](https://bluearchive.wiki/wiki/FAQ#What_is_Rerolling?_Should_I_do_it?).

>Is there pity? What's a spark
There are 2 ways in gacha games to get a banner unit: spark and pity. With a spark you roll X amount of times (200 in BA) before you can redeem a guaranteed copy of the unit. With pity for every roll past Y rolls without getting a highest star unit you get an increased chance to roll one, up to a 100%.
**BA has sparks, not pity.**
1 spark = 200 rolls = 24,000 gems

You can only spark units currently on banner. 
**Sparks do not carry over between banners**, so whatever Recruitment Points you have left over gets turned into crafting mats when the banner ends.

>How often do I get a spark?
You get 12,000 gems on average per month, which means it takes 2 months to get a spark. There's a lot of freebies lying around for new accounts though.

>What should I do after my initial rolls? Do I roll without a spark?
You want to save up for a spark before rolling. Do not roll without a spark, because you can get fucked really hard.

>I have X amount of rolls into the banner, but I already rolled the banner unit. Should I keep going?
Play it by ear. It's always nice to save some extra rolls for the future, but as a rule of thumb I'd say above 150 rolls you just keep going.
It depends on whether you like or want the other girl too (if applicable). 

>I just got a ten roll ticket! Do they expire?
No.
The only thing that expires is the 3* guarantee ticket you can buy (with real money) during anniversaries.

>I got the banner unit at my 200th roll. Do I claim her or do I get the other banner unit that I don't have?
Sparking a dupe (copy of already owned unit) is the equivalent of 550 eligma, so if you don't want the other units on banner claiming the banner unit is totally fine. That being said, having a bigger roster gives you more options and some units increase drops during certain events.

>Is there a good planner for banners?

## Team formation
In general a team consists of 1 tank, 1 healer, and DPS.
You want to match the colour of ur enemy with your attack type (e.g. red unit good into red mob). 
![Typings](https://i.imgur.com/x6eZlVK.jpeg)
**Weak** does 200% damage.
**Normal** does 100% damage.
**Resist** does 50% damage.

Attack type (colour) > Role (tank/dps) > Environment > EX and skill levels > Star level. Iori might be the best unit in the game, but mismatching her against red units makes her do 1/4th of her expected damage.
For healers and buffers you can ignore the environment mood and attack type. 
Always run full teams (6 students). 
Supports =/= DPS. They SUPPORT you, by bringing CC. They do not deal damage. 


For PvE (normal and hard missions, bounties, commissions) you want AOE units. If you're having trouble with a boss, bring in a strong single target (ST) DPS instead.
At the start you run an evasion tank like Yuuka or Tsubaki, who are the best at tanking damage early on. Eimi is also a solid option thanks to her self-heal EX and very solid damage early on. The damage type of ur tank doesn't matter too much however, since their job is to tank damage (yes, really). After you get access to T4 bags, you can run more orthodox tanks like Hoshino or Haruka (or Tsubaki, because she's still really good).
The best healer in the game is currently Koharu (3\*), but the 2nd best is Serina (1\*). Having a low cost EX heal AND a **free** heal on their basic skills make both of them a really solid option.

Put ur tank in position 2 or 3, because if you put her on the edges there's a bigger chance your unit on the other side takes aggro.
There are strategies where you put certain units on the edges for better angles, or in the middle for better reach, but that's often times irrelevant. Try out what fits for you.

Your units also have different environmental moods (affinity) depending on the terrain. While this isn't a major concern early on, once you have a big enough roster you can try swapping around some units.
![Affinity](https://i.imgur.com/8kE8mtH.jpg) 

The subskill of supports don't stack with each other if they have the same description (e.g. double ATK subskills don't stack). If they are the same, the level of the support in the right slot's subskill will be used, not the highest level one. 
For raids the strongest support combo is (generally) Crit DMG + ATK sub skill. 

[This google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BO-Uh_CsAOIetPjrNyFy9-7r1a4RAtVwK135bBC3hzM/edit#gid=2128322015) provides a more comprehensive and up-to-date guide to team formations.

>What does the leader position do
It shows you her funny leader animation at the start of every battle, her chibi in the overworld, and is the girl that appears on your victory/defeat screen.
That's it.

!!! info
	Match colours, and bring a tank and healer. 

## Leveling ur roster
This is the bonsai part. 
**Level up whoever you're *using* at the moment**. It's easier to max out 3 students to 3777 (EX/basic/enhanced/sub skill) than 1 student to 5MMM (M = max lvl). It's best to keep small rosters, so keep things at a 1 team per colour scale. You use each team for **all content related to their colour**.
For example, you use the same 4 characters in your red team for all the red PvE missions, the bounties, and the red raids (Kaiten and Hieronymus).
Once you have more resources you can branch out to a wider roster. 

A good start to every account is upgrading ur Serina to 2\*, as she's your best friend early on.

[This google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BO-Uh_CsAOIetPjrNyFy9-7r1a4RAtVwK135bBC3hzM/edit#gid=2128322015) [(image version)](https://imgur.io/a/ejZ2aIG) tells you what good units are to invest into for PvE, just go to the 'Teambuilding' sheet. 

[Use this one for raids (and **skill priority**)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VSzm_ioCt2AdRvkfL9HKNNZSbyslayVERXxVxR6nzh4/htmlview?pru=AAABfU25_0Y\*DiMJDJXmrDW7EsUjWhKvGQ#) and [this one for PvP](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1NiLS4DloW7A92nIh5n5wl9uYkLAuYa-7Ph-u8RXVjik/htmlview#). 
The 'best' units are the ones with a high score, but be aware that BA is a game of niches. 

![how to use excel](https://i.imgur.com/QHrepqU.png)
Make sure to read the extra notes on the right as well. 

You level up ur EX and regular skills based on raids and (to a lesser degree) PvP. You can get by with only levels and equipment in PvE stuff.
You get the biggest return on investment (ROI) by upgrading ur DPS. Upgrading ur healers or buffers is also good, since you can use them in every damage type/colour. Tanks are generally fine with just levels and gear (specifically the 2nd equipment slot), so you can skimp out on their EX and regular skills. 

If you want to plan ahead with your investments, you can use [the planner](https://justin163.com/planner/) to see how much you exactly need. 
![Seeing your cool stuff](https://i.imgur.com/i1aXm3X.png)
If you want to know how much AP it costs to upgrade a student's gear [use this link](https://sensei.help/).

>How much ligma/elephs does it cost to do raise my student's star level to X?
![Fandom Ligma](https://i.imgur.com/a9phNoj.png)
Taken from https://bluearchive.fandom.com/wiki/Divine_Fragment

From 3* to UE50 it costs 2400 elephs.

>Can I brick myself leveling up a student (e.g. Priconne)?
No. At most you brick yourself by levelling the worse characters.

## Normal and Hard missions
Puzzle gaming. Look at youtube videos if you don't know how to solve a puzzle lol (or [use the wiki](https://bluearchive.wiki/wiki/Missions), most missions have a strategy guide) 
You can cancel the special ability of the boss and elite mod with a well-timed CC. This is especially handy against the elite tankers, who get damage reduction during their ability (which can cost you precious seconds). 
If you have trouble with the boss you can charge ur EX bar to 10 the battle before.

A personal recommendation is to use Tactical Supports. They can carry a lot of the missions by themselves. 

Go as far as you can in the normal mode for the cafe upgrades. They drop every 3 areas at mission 5, that boost your daily AP recovery (this means 3-5, 6-5, ...). If your goal is to get those upgrades early it's fine to 1\* a few missions, first time rewards don't care about ur stars. 
Don't forget to actually upgrade your cafe.
![Ranking up the cafe](https://i.imgur.com/WgMiJXG.png)
(you can press that button)

If you hit a limit with your progression, switch over from normal to hard mode. Do the same until you hit a wall there. Alternatively, drain ur AP and get a few extra levels (1 AP = 1 XP) before trying the same stage again.
You can refresh a hard node once a day for 3 extra sweeps. This is handy during rateup events, but generally not advised as it costs pyros. 
Farming a hard node for equipments is better than the normal counterpart.
Don't ever farm for BDs, the drop chance is abysmal. 

Every stage drops stuff for 2 and 3 tiers down of the respective equipment (e.g. t5 boots drop t3 and t2 boots). The lower tier stuff have a lower drop rate however. In addition, the left item also has a higher drop chance than the other 2 items. See below for an example. 

![19-1 drop rate](https://i.imgur.com/Z8Ws5DJ.png) 
(drop chance for 19-1) 

>Should I swipe my stages?
Yes.
There is no benefit to manually doing them.

!!! info
	Go as far as you can in Normal missions, and when you hit a wall switch over to Hard mode and do the same. 

##Farmable units 
Currently available units that you can farm
![currently available farmable units](https://arch-img.b4k.co/vg/1679180130356.png) 
As of 19/03/23 (DD/MM/YY) ((the way it was meant to be formatted)) 

>What hard nodes should I farm?
![hard nodes to farm](https://i.imgur.com/ebMCX79.png)
Someone's made a [student insight doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1BO-Uh_CsAOIetPjrNyFy9-7r1a4RAtVwK135bBC3hzM/htmlview#), check it out for a more detailed explanation on farmable units.

>Should I farm a unit I don't own?
Yes. With enough shards you can redeem her through the student list. The caveat being that it can take several months before you can actually redeem a specific student. 

>Should I redeem X?
Eh.
It's more efficient waiting for a spook (non banner girl appearing through the gacha), because a dupe only gives you 30 shards if it's a 3\*. This effectively means you lose out on 90 shards by redeeming. You also need to consider if you have the mats to upgrade her afterwards, too. 
*However*, if there's a raid/content you want to clear or if you want an easier/comfier time it's fine to redeem.
If you think she's cute it's also cool to redeem. 

## Bounties
Your daily mats farm. Remember how you need to match the colours before? Well, now you need to match the attack type (red) AND the school AND the environment mood. If you lack options you can run blue units too, as long as you max out the school buff. 
With a well timed CC you can cancel the rangers' special ability, so if you start to get melted make sure to use ur CC abilities to cancel their skills!
![CC in BA](https://i.imgur.com/dRYPRoE.png)


Always try to go for the highest tier you can clear. It drops lower tier mats as well, so there's no reason to farm a lower level.
You won't lose a ticket if you retreat, so you have infinite retries. 


>What do I get from the Bounty shop?
See [the shop section](https://rentry.org/how2playba#shop). 

## Commissions
Ignore this until you can clear the Base Defense H (recommended level 65, but doable way below that), thank you.
Only farm commissions during rate up events if you did the above. 

Commissions is comprised of two modes: Base Defense and Item Retrieval.
Base Defense is a wave defense against small yellow armored enemies. You want to bring your best AOE yellow students and at least one tank. A useful trick is to use Serina to move your tank further ahead so they take 100% of the aggro from the waves of bots. This also prevents ur tank from running behind ur team. 
sHifumi is surprisingly VERY good here, able to solo carry your run. Regular Hifumi also works as an okay way to tank damage, giving you much needed breathing room if your tank melts too fast. 
Anyone you'd use for (indoors) Chesed works here. 

Item Retrieval is a single-target blue challenge with a strict time limit. Bring your best ST blues, but ST yellows work fine too if you're lacking good blue students. There is no need to bring a tank or healer to this mode.
Any DPS you'd use for (urban) Shiro & Kuro works here. 

## Scrimmages
The place you get mats to upgrade ur Exclusive Weapon (EW)/Unique Equipment (UE).
If you're not sure how to tackle it look at a youtube video. A common tactic uses Serina EX to reposition Tsubaki into their team, preventing most aoe from hitting your backline. 
Not worth farming until you clear at the very least B. When you hit ultra lategame you can start skipping out on them, but once you start hitting 5\*s on your students they become really annoying so don't neglect scrims too much. 

Feel free to skip during farmable events. 
With the small monthly you reduce the AP cost per ticket by 5, and with the big monthly you reduce it by 10. Buying both means that scrims become free to do.  

## Total Assault (Raid)
Welcome to the endgame content of BA, the biweekly PREMIER source of BDs, technotes, and elephs.
The first thing you want to do is join a club. The second thing is borrowing the strongest unit for the raid. Congrats you just beat the raid.

Read up on what the boss does and how to tackle it with [the raid guide.](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1bvYGwIh-9o-2JQ4Q2MQXtsL0peiCPrRuw0l3HQmTrZ0)
Alternatively look up some clears or guides on YouTube. 

Up to HC you can borrow someone's hypercarry who can beat the raid by herself, just build a decent supporting team around her.
Don't try EX without a mock battle if ur below the recommended level.

If you're a pro raid gamer, it's good practice to either (mentally) make a note of what time you started the raid or what time you'll stop resetting for a high score and finish the raid. Getting a cool gamer score is not worth losing a ticket over. In JP a timer is available in the pause screen, so look forward to that.

If you need something in the middle of ur raid battle, you can close the app/quit the game and start Blue Archive again. This way you won't lose ur ticket, your attempt will stay active, AND you get to change ur team/positioning/starting EX skills. 
This works in mock battles and actual runs. 

See the [shop section](https://rentry.org/how2playba#shop) for what to buy. 

>I forgot if I started a mock battle or a real run, help! 
In battle, at the top left of your screen it shows if it's a mock battle. If there isn't notice, it's a real run. 

>Should I save my raid coins? 
No. There's a limit on every item you can buy, and the shop refreshes before a new raid. Don't be a retard. 
You don't lose your coins after a refresh. 

## Joint Firing Drill/Joint Exercise 
!!! Warning LOOK AT A YOUTUBE VIDEO
It's commissions but with a unique gimmick. The gimmick changes every time, so no 2 drills are the same. 
If you don't know what to do against a gimmick, look at a few videos. If it's ongoing, filter by 1 week and you should be good.

You can borrow students for this challenge, so being in a club is very helpful if you want to get a good score.
There are no rankings (like raids), and higher scores simply give you more coins/credits per clear.

The tickets for Joint Firing Drill work differently than the ones for raids. Unlike with raids, you will not waste a ticket by retreating in battle. You'll only waste it if you give up entirely (in the stage menu) or the sixty minute timer on the ticket runs out.
Once you have used up an entire ticket (3 clears), you are able to sweep your remaining tickets.

It's not worth it to hyperinvest into someone for just the exercise. Just take the L, do a lower difficulty, and move on.

Look at the [shop section](https://rentry.org/how2playba#shop) if you want details on what to buy. The shop refreshes before the next drill starts.

## Tactical Challenge (PvP)
!!!warning VERY FRUSTRATING GAMEMODE, BE AWARE 

The goal of PvP is to match your attack type with the enemy's armour type, while mismatching their attack type with your armour type. 
Use [the following tierlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1NiLS4DloW7A92nIh5n5wl9uYkLAuYa-7Ph-u8RXVjik/htmlview#) to build your team around. 
General advice is to use a double tank setup + Shun, with good supports. Tsubaki is always good. 


You can skip the battle if you don't like to be writhe in pain. 
The pvp coin reset takes place 10 hours after the daily reset. Which is why it's better to so your pvp battles AFTER the pvp coin reset, so you can redeem the highest rank you achieved that day. 
No, you can not turn off the auto button in battle. 

## Shop
The place where u buy stuff and rub Sora's forehead.

>Normal shop
Buy out the artifacts in the normal shop at the bottom every day, until you have a nice stack of 200 of the target item. Ignore the tickets (unless if you're a korean leviathan whale), because they're not worth your gems; and get the enhancement stones *only if you need them*.
Buying the activity reports with credits is kind of bad (as in really bad).

>Eleph shops
You max out your wife. After that? You max the alt of your wife (she has an alt right?)
If ur a metafag: bring Serina to 2\*, and (if ur too impatient) Kotama to 3\*, who is also available in the raid shop. After that? Whoever is the main hypercarry of a raid you're planning to beat.
Don't use ur elephs for farmable characters if you can, they're quite literally farmable.
Ignore eleph shop 2. It has some good stuff in it, but elephs are a really rare resource. 

>Raid shop
![For me Hanako is SSS tier, buy her elephs NOW](https://i.imgur.com/V5QosY2.png)
You should limit yourself to buying out 2 characters per raid and coin type, but this isn't a hard rule. 
Don't get the secret tech note until you actually need it. You use it to bring your regular skills from 9 -> 10, which aren't a bottleneck until you're well into your BA tenure. Besides that ur free to buy whatever you need.
I personally recommend buying stuff for the current and next raid.

>PvP shop
In general you want to save up your coins so you get to buy out the pvp drinks during events. If there's a girl that appeals to you feel free to buy her. Utaha is the most 'meta' character in this shop, as her UG makes her a top pvp support. She requires a lot of investment however. 
Don't buy the reports or credits, they really really suck. You can buy the drinks and farm commissions for a better efficiency 

In case you didn't realise, you can refresh the pvp shop with pvp coins, NOT with pyros. This way you get to buy out the pvp drinks 4x
![How to refresh the shop](https://i.imgur.com/T9Wf7p5.png)

>Joint Firing Drill/Joint Exercise shop 
Prioritise whatever you value in this shop. You can make an argument for anything and it'd be decent. This section will be a lot of less authoritative/prescriptive (you need to do this) as I go over every item. Choose for yourself.

I personally wouldn't recommend buying out the artifacts. Even though you can't get these artifacts through bounty, there are a lot of events (e.g.  Decagrammaton) where you can farm them. You also get an okayish chunk through raids.
Check out [the event page in the wiki](https://bluearchive.wiki/wiki/Events) to see if any of the artifacts drop soon. 

Reports are your safest bet if you don't know what to pick. They're purple, they're FREE, and you'll always need them. They're REALLY expensive though, so you can skip them in favour of the other options. 

The shards are decent. Eimi is a solid tank, and Sumire and Tsurugi are both yellow aoe dps frontliners. Unfortunately, there are better alternatives to Eimi, and the only place Sumire and Tsurugi shine in is in (indoors) Chesed as a 2nd or 3rd option. I personally prioritise buying them out since elephs are hard to obtain, the shards are nice to have, and because I don't have much need for the other options. 

With the fusion stones you can convert a surplus of a certain type of mat into a different mat in the crafting chamber (the 2nd one). It really helps bridging the gaps in your stash at a decent price.
I'm personally using the gold ones to convert gifts into the ones I need, but most of the time you won't need these things. They're very handy when you need them, so having a decent stack of them can come in handy (don't buy the grey ones though) 

The secret tech note. I personally think its kind of whatever, but that's my opinion. My clubbros have bought them and occasionally I have too, so if you want it the option is there. Definitely one of the lower priority items though. 

>Mastery Certificate/Expert Permit shop
(After you hit MAX level, 1 AP = 1 Mastery Cert) 
According to [this korean post](https://gall.dcinside.com/mgallery/board/view/?id=projectmx&no=3931989), the priority is:
Credits > Limited Elephs (that you need) > Pins > Eligma > Reports
Everything depends on your needs at the time though, and you can just buy whatever you want.
You can't unlock/redeem limited students through this shop, so don't buy them if you don't have them (or plan to). I personally (opinion) would say that they're the worst item in the shop too, so I only get the ones of girls that I like. 
The gear blueprints are a godsend though. Everything about this shop is honestly. Thank you, John Nexon. 

>Bounty shop
Every month a new shop, save ur stuff for (good) artifacts only. You can get BDs/technotes from the raid shop, so I wouldn't recommend buying them here.
It's fine to skip a shop if you don't need anything from it that month. Try to limit ur purchases to t4 artifacts too.

## Crafting Chamber
Feel free to use the speedup tickets, you'll have a billion of them lying around. 
There has never been a 2x event on the crafting chamber, so there's no point in saving your crafting materials up. 

>Material Synthesis (the normal one)
Radiant (highest tier mats) >= BDs > Weapon Parts > Furniture (if not capped yet in cafe) > Gifts >= Shiny (high tier mats) > Rest
If you want to go to node 2: use t1-2 mats you don't care about.

You can trade T3+ mats for a 3rd node, which also has a chance to give you character elephs, t4 gifts, secret tech note fragments, and MONEY (!). 
The rewards are p good, but only use them if you have an abundance in useless mats. 

>Material Fusion (the new one)
Trading your garbage away for the freshest sneaks
**Do not get the raffle ticket**, the choice ticket is the one you want. Raffle tickets are just another gacha, if you prefer to get them seek help. 

You can dump the mats from useless schools (like Red Winter, Shanghai, and SRT) into a better one. The useless schools only have 1-2 characters you want to max out anyway. Gaps in your artifact stash can also be helped bridged. 
You can trade your useless furnitures away for a better one, which is pretty neat. If it's worth the purple fusion stone is for you to decide. 

## Events
(the story ones, not 2x ones) 
>Cool stuff to know 
The highest bonus will be saved, so if you 1\* a quest stage with the max bonus then 3\* it with a different team, you can sweep the stage and get the highest bonus. This also works vice versa (first 3\*, then 1\* with max bonus). 

You unlock the welfare/free unit by doing the story missions (the very 1st one). Do this before you farm the quest stages.

>I'm a newbie and there's an event going on, but I can only clear up to stage X. What do I do? 
- Do the story and farm the highest stage tier you can do
- Buy out the high priority stuff from the shop first (Artifacts > BDs > Technotes > whatever > Furniture)
- Buy from T4 -> T1.

What you're supposed to do is a case by case scenario though, since some events are pretty shit to farm, some artifacts and schools are worse than others, or you might be close to getting a cafe upgrade. You can always ask in the thread 

You're pretty fucked regardless, so gl bro

>I have X shards of this event's welfare unit but I can't claim her wtf! 
DO THE STORY MISSIONS

### Hoarding before an event 
Generally only do this for 3x campaigns, if the week before it is dead, or if it's a really good farming event 

You can save up some extra AP right before an event to splurge on the event. This way every AP you spend is worth several times its normal value, vastly outweighing the small loss you take from missing out on daily regen AP (if you are saving for several days). 

If you want a specific guide, use:
![how to hoard AP guide](https://i.imgur.com/nq3vsPW.png)
This is assuming the event starts after the Monday reset. Add 14 hours for story events, because those start on Tuesday after the maintenance. 

Bounties: **if and only if (I.F.F) you buy the monthlies**, you can save those extra tickets by not doing your bounties for a fat bonus during rate ups. Be aware that your free daily tickets will go to waste, but the bonus you get outweighs the 2 tickets you lose out on. 

## Whaling for dummies
New player package (3 per account) > monthlies (the ones that give bounty tickets) > anniversary exclusive packages > biggest package with bonus 

The 1 dollar Serika is nice, but pretty unneeded. It's incredibly worth if you're planning on maxing her out and spending big, as it saves a lot of AP farming the nodes. 

I'm not a big spender so I can't give too much of an opinion on the other packs. The anniversary selectors seem cool though, definitely worth a zinger box or two. 

## Misc. stuff
You can rub people's heads after you unlock their L2Ds. This also counts for NPCs (e.g. Arona, Sora, Rin)
Yes. You really can. 

>Banners
Global follows the JP schedule reasonably tight, see [the banner list for all the upcoming banners](https://bluearchive.wiki/wiki/Banner_List).

>Rolling 
If you're planning on both units in a double banner, *don't* claim your spark until after you roll 1 of them or hit 400 rolls. 

>XP
1 AP = 1 XP. Your level is tied to how much AP you spend, so there's no real way to level up faster. 
You can 3x refresh your AP for 90 gems a day, which is kind of good. Whether it's worth it is for you to decide.

MAX level is current level cap + 1 xp off the next level (e.g. if the cap is 20, MAX would be 1 xp off lvl 21)

>AP
Any AP that crosses the max limit (999) gets sent to your bank. It expires in 7 days, so make sure to spend it at some point.

>Lessons
For the Schale areas: at rank 10 you unlock receiving choice tickets on top of the regular drops when you're doing your lessons. Pretty neat
The max rank for an area is 12.
Increasing ur Total Area Rank also unlocks extra daily lesson tickets, in case you didn't realise. There's a 7th ticket you can unlock at rank 80. As there are only 7 areas (9 in JP), and 80/7 = 11 + 3/7, I'd suggest maxing out every area. 
 
>Normal Missions
The XP your students are supposed to get when you manually farm a node gets converted into a grey activity report while sweeping. At certain breakpoints this gets converted into a higher tier report.
This part I'm a little unsure about, but I think it's every 5 sweeps you get a blue report and every 30 sweeps you get an orange report. So ideally you'd sweep in multiples of 5 or 30.
It's pretty useless to minmax though, since you'll always be in report hell. And credit hell. And artifact hell. Just a neat thing you can do to feel cool

For every level below the recommended level you'll start doing 2% less damage while taking 2% more dmg, up to 20 levels. If you ever wonder why it gets so hard progressing, that's why. This is compared between student and enemy level, not Sensei level. 
Very important to keep in mind is that you can ignore the recommended level. Until you actually can't get further, ignore it. Otherwise you block urself mentally, instead of the game stopping you. 

>Daily missions
Doing stage 1 of commissions for the daily mission is pretty worth. 20 mastery certificates for the price of 5? That's a steal. 
Doing the weekly commission is incredibly worth. 3 orange reports for 75 AP is great. 

>Birthdays/holidays 
If you switch out from the L2D, on (holi/birth)days your assistant gives you a unique dialogue if you tap her. 

>Friends
Need a friend or two?
Add a couple of /bag/ bros from [the friend google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hUDz9eM25BabBxn7GHXemnhZl3ZSdxpAcJGIvxmFjqM/).
If you want to help a future newfag or would like to put urself up there yourself, [feel free to add yourself to the spreadsheet by filling out the form](https://forms.gle/Y5BKx17EQaawVTqLA). Entries will be automatically removed after 30 days. It's also completely anonymous, so don't worry.

>Cafe
You can headpat a girl again after 3 hours from the last time you did, giving you 4 opportunities every cafe reset. 

>Relationship levels 
The max level is 10 below 3\*, 20 at 3-4\*, and 100 at 5\*
I have no idea how these sites work, but they seem helpful.

# FAQ
> I'm AP capped! What do I spend it on?
You spend it on whatever campaign is currently running (the pink banner). If it's a dead week (e.g. only 2x scrimmages) it's:
Hard missions > Normal missions > Commissions.
Commissions are only worth it during campaign events, and only if you can farm the orange report, which are available at level H+. The credit commissions are decent too, so if ur poor you can sweep them. 

> I don't have any credits/reports what do I do!
You pretend nothing's wrong and do the same what you're already doing.
You can get pink reports in the Joint Exercise Shop, and you can get reports AND credits from the Mastery Certificate Shop. 
There's also technically the reports you can buy in the normal shop for credits, but those are a scam. 

>Is it too late to play? 
No.
The best time to start was yesterday, the second best time to start is right now. 
If you're playing the game for a specific girl, I'd still suggest playing now even if she's limited. Better to find out if you like the game now than wait and be disappointed later.

>I just missed the X banner, will she get a rerun?
Students attached to a story event get a rerun, including limited units. Otherwise the chance is pretty slim.
See https://bluearchive.wiki/wiki/Banner_List for future banners. 

>Should I join a (/bag/) club? 
Yes. It's 10 AP daily, an extra source of credits, and it lets you borrow hyper invested students for Total Assault, Joint Exercise, and Conquest.
See https://rentry.org/holdingthebag for /bag/ clubs. 

No one cares if you don't use the chat. 

>Do 2x/3x events apply on the first time clear rewards? 
No. 
I wish they did too. 

>I can't beat X what do I do? 
Go on youtube and look at a video. You'll find that is the answer to a lot of problems in life. 

>What is UE / EW? 
Unique Equipment, or Exclusive Weapon in Global. 
It's the gun. 

UE1 = UE30, UE2 = UE40, etc. You can use them interchangeably. 

>What is UG / UI? 
Unique Gear, or Unique Item in global. 
It's the 4th equipment. 

>How does X stat work? 
See [this link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ui0FRgG8h8RB1-cA639F3ETDrVM7q9FKftg4vBKBAAQ). 

>How do servers work? What server am I in.
There are 2 game versions right now: JP and Global. 
JP is Japan, which is ~5 month ahead of Global. 
Global is divided in 5 different regions: Global (= EU), NA, Asia, Taiwan, and Korea.
You can only join clubs or add friends from the same region. 

![how to find out your server](https://i.imgur.com/J0Mt5pr.png)

>When did X change get added 
You'll have to manually look for it. 
Go to https://bluearchive.wiki/wiki/Events, open an event, and underneath Event Summary > details you can find new additions.
