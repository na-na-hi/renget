# /bag/ Newfag guide
No, it is not too late to play the game. The best time to start is now. 
Not just a reroll guide. 
Scroll to the bottom for my last edit date. This guide is not outdated.

[TOC] 

##Top Tips 
- Match colours (e.g. red enemy = use red units) 
- Read the story (it's fun) 
- Rush through normal missions to unlock cafe upgrades and game modes. Don't worry about 3*'ing too much. 
- Splurge ur AP. 1 AP = 1 Account XP, so dump stamina to level up. 
- Take advantage of the school bonuses and use CC in Bounty 
- [Join a club.](https://rentry.org/holdingthebag) There's no clan tryharding or an obligation to talk. Newfags are very welcome. 
- You can pat girls' head (Arona and Ayumu included!) 


## Downloading/Setting up the game

JP - [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.YostarJP.BlueArchive&hl=en_US&gl=JP&pli=1) | [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/%E3%83%96%E3%83%AB%E3%83%BC%E3%82%A2%E3%83%BC%E3%82%AB%E3%82%A4%E3%83%96/id1515877221) | [QooApp](https://apps.qoo-app.com/ja/app/12252)

Global - [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nexon.bluearchive&hl=en_US&gl=US) | [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blue-archive/id1571873795) | [QooApp](https://apps.qoo-app.com/en/app/12252)

Global may require a VPN to play, as it is [region-locked](https://twitter.com/EN_BlueArchive/status/1456909220058566656). JP is region-locked for payments. The only server to avoid would be Korea's server as raids are much, much, MUCH more competitive there than any other, leading to a potentially very detrimental experience. Otherwise, pick whichever you want and you will be fine.

You can't choose which server your start on, so if you wish to start somewhere else you'll need a VPN for it. See 'How do servers work? What server am I in' for more. 

You can play the game through emulators such as [Nox](https://www.bignox.com/), [Bluestacks](https://www.bluestacks.com/bluestacks-5.html), [Memu](https://www.memuplay.com/) or [LDPlayer](https://www.ldplayer.net/). Make sure to crank up the memory allocation as well. 

 If you want the game in something like "tablet mode" (which lets you see more of the screen (some visuals are cut off at default resolution)), consider changing your emulator to the resolution 1440x1080

For comparison:
![Resolutions](https://i.imgur.com/1Zekisx.jpg)

As an aside, payment options can be dodgy on JP if you want to be a whale depending on your region/your payment account's region. These situations are more complicated. Ask about them in the thread.

>I saw that the game has a 'censored' version. Am I using it?
The censored version is exclusive to Korea. 
There is also a tell on the app icon which one is the censored one.
![Look for the T](https://i.imgur.com/h3Mqh2Z.png)

### Game crashes and fixes 
This will mostly cover emulator only problems. 

If you experience crashes while playing the game, you should fiddle around in the settings menu. Try the following one at a time:
- Make sure you're playing on the 64-bit instance of your emulator 
- Crank up the CPU/Memory allocation in the emulator settings 
- Lower in-game framerate and quality 
- Switch between software and hardware decoding 

Disclaimer: I used to use Bluestacks5, but now I'm using LDPlayer9.
You can always switch emulators if nothing works.

>I keep getting "Server failed to process request. Returning to title screen.", what do I do?
[Certain countries are blocked from playing Blue Archive](https://twitter.com/EN_BlueArchive/status/1456909220058566656), hop on a VPN if this applies to you.
Alternatively you need to reset your network, see [this video on how to do that](https://youtu.be/J4ohYlkzeW8?t=32).

## (Re)rolling
**Spend *all* your rolls after the first mission. After that you can reroll.**
Make sure to claim stuff from missions and your mailbox too. 

I'd advice you to do the same even if you don't reroll, just so you have something to work with. 

**BA has sparks, not pity.** 
**Sparks do not carry over between banners.**
See 'Is there pity? What's a spark' for more 

Your very first roll guarantees a single 3\* student from a pool of *only* the release roster (students released on 2021/02/04) on the 10th roll. You can still get other 3\*s on the other 9 rolls before that.
![no, you can't get Ako on your 10th roll.](https://i.imgur.com/0nMJLHD.png)
Rolling in 10s guarantees at least one 2\* student so it's better to roll in multis.
If you have no interest in the current banner student(s) use the Regular Recruitment banner, as all pick-up rates will be the same.

The Startdash banner is a new account banner that guarantees a 3* (if you buy the ticket with real money). See below for more.
>What are good units to roll for?
Made by /bag/ (also works on JP):
![Reroll targets](https://i.imgur.com/tmi8QuB.png)

Being farmable means you can unlock the student by farming her node(s) for a long period of time. See [this section](https://rentry.org/how2playba#farmable-units) for more. 

Or alternatively:
![Reroll targets](https://i.imgur.com/IdQnlKt.png)
Roll until you get 10 points (taken from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45dwbZz7kzg)

You can always ask /bag/ for advice.

>What about units who are only blue or gold (1 or 2 star)?
![Good 1/2 Star Students](https://i.imgur.com/nixPYgA.png)

>How do I reroll? (global only) 
![How to reroll](https://i.imgur.com/t3kHH0w.png)
Menu Tab (top right) > Account > Reset account
For JP the method is outlined [here](https://bluearchive.wiki/wiki/Rerolling). 

>What can I get from the Startdash (the paid ticket)?
You get 1 ten roll, which guarantees a 3\* unit of a set pool.
![Startdash pool](https://i.imgur.com/vJqP5Yo.png)

>Should I reroll?
For your waifu? Of course. But besides that? 

Rerolling makes the game easier, but the game is pretty easy as is. It's like going from normal difficulty to easy. 
I personally didn't reroll and don't recommend it, but I have the advantage of being a day 1 player (and a dolphin that buys the monthlies). The reward for having a fully meta roster is also pretty negligible (3 extra rolls from raids every month and maybe 10 extra rolls if you're rank 1 pvp).

>Is there pity? What's a spark
There are 2 ways in gacha games to get a banner unit: spark and pity. With a spark you roll X amount of times (200 in BA) before you can redeem a guaranteed copy of the unit. With pity for every roll past Y rolls without getting a highest star unit you get an increased chance to roll one, up to a 100%.

**BA has sparks, not pity.**
1 spark = 200 rolls = 24,000 gems

You can only spark units currently on banner. 
**Sparks do not carry over between banners**, so whatever Recruitment Points you have left over gets turned into crafting mats when the banner ends.

>How many rolls do I get? How often do I get a spark?
You get 12,000 gems (= 100 rolls) on average per month as a f2p ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlueArchive/s/uIqemypEhj) [(image version)](https://i.imgur.com/aFw06dG.png)), which means it takes 2 months to get a spark. There's a lot of freebies lying around for new accounts though.

>What should I do after my initial rolls? Do I roll without a spark?
You want to save up for a spark before rolling. **Do not roll without a spark**, because you can get fucked really hard.

>I have X amount of rolls into the banner, but I already rolled the banner unit. Should I keep going?
Play it by ear. It's always nice to save some extra rolls for the future, but as a rule of thumb I'd say above 150 rolls you just keep going.
It depends on whether you like or want the other girl too (if applicable). 

>I just got a ten roll ticket! Do they expire?
The only things that expire are the 3* guarantee ticket you can buy (with real money) during anniversaries and the 10 roll ticket you get from the Grand Raid.
You get a notification if something in your inventory expires soon, and you can see when they expire in your inventory and in the gacha menu.

>I have a 10 roll ticket from the Grand raid and a regular ticket, which one is used first? 
The one that expires. 
If you have 2 tickets that expire it prioritises the one that expires first. 

>I got the banner unit at my 200th roll. Do I claim her or do I get the other banner unit that I don't have?
Sparking a dupe (copy of already owned unit) is the equivalent of 550 eligma, so if you don't want the other unit(s) on banner claiming the banner unit is totally fine. That being said, I recommend claiming an unowned unit. Having a bigger roster gives you more options and some units increase drops during certain events.

>Is there a good planner for banners?
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_Zjt_OM9XXidY3uYYDK92W9GrR3DN5cQsZ0IJsoEbjY/edit#gid=1082031226
Read the top right on the first sheet for instruction.

>I want both banner units, what should I do? 
If you're planning on both units in a double banner, *don't* claim your spark until after you roll 1 of them or hit 400 rolls.

## Team formation
In general a team consists of 1 tank, 1 healer, and DPS.
You want to match the colour of ur enemy with your attack type (e.g. red unit good into red mob). 
![Typings](https://i.imgur.com/x6eZlVK.jpeg)
**Weak** does 200% damage.
**Normal** does 100% damage.
**Resist** does 50% damage.

[This google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BO-Uh_CsAOIetPjrNyFy9-7r1a4RAtVwK135bBC3hzM/edit#gid=2128322015) [(image version)](https://imgur.io/a/ejZ2aIG) tells you what students to prioritise, just go to the 'Teambuilding' sheet (or click on the imgur). 

Attack type (colour) > Role (tank/dps) > Environment > EX and skill levels > Star level. Iori might be the best unit in the game, but mismatching her against red units makes her do 1/4th of her expected damage.
For healers, buffers, and tanks you can ignore the environment mood and attack type. 
Always run full teams (6 students). 
Supports =/= DPS. They SUPPORT you by bringing CC. They do not deal damage. 

For PvE (normal and hard missions, bounties, commissions) you want AOE units. If you're having trouble with a boss, bring in a strong single target (ST) DPS instead.
At the start you run an evasion tank like Yuuka or Tsubaki, who are the best at tanking damage early on. Eimi is also a solid option thanks to her self-heal EX and very solid damage early on. The damage type of ur tank doesn't matter too much however, since their job is to tank damage. PvE mobs deal neutral damage, so armour types don't matter either. 
After you get access to T4 bags, you can run more orthodox tanks like Hoshino or Haruka (or Tsubaki, because she's still really good).
The best healer in the game is currently Koharu (3\*), but the 2nd best is Serina (1\*). Having a low cost EX heal AND a **free** heal on their basic skills make both of them a really solid option.

Put ur tank in position 2 or 3, because if you put her on the edges there's a bigger chance your unit on the other side takes aggro.
There are strategies where you put certain units on the edges for better angles, or in the middle for better reach, but that's often times irrelevant. Try out what fits for you.

Your units also have different environmental moods (affinity) depending on the terrain. While this isn't a major concern early on, once you have a big enough roster you can try swapping around some units.
![Affinity](https://i.imgur.com/8kE8mtH.jpg) 

The sub skill of supports don't stack with each other if they have the same description (e.g. double ATK sub skills don't stack). If they are the same, the level of the support in the right slot's sub skill will be used. Not the highest level one. 
For raids the strongest support combo is (generally) Crit DMG + ATK sub skill. 

[This google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BO-Uh_CsAOIetPjrNyFy9-7r1a4RAtVwK135bBC3hzM/edit#gid=2128322015) provides a more comprehensive and up-to-date guide to team formations.

>What does the leader position do
It shows you her funny leader animation at the start of every battle, her chibi in the overworld, and is the girl that appears on your victory/defeat screen.
That's it.

!!! info
	Match colours, and bring a tank and healer. 

## Leveling ur roster
This is the bonsai part. 
**Level up whoever you're *using* at the moment**. It's easier to max out 3 students to 3777 (EX/basic/enhanced/sub skill) than 1 student to 5MMM (M = max lvl). It's best to keep small rosters, so keep things at a 1 team per colour scale. You use each team for **all content related to their colour**.
For example, you use the same 4 characters in your red team for all the red PvE missions, the bounties, and the red raids (Kaiten, Hieronymus, and Greg).
Once you have more resources you can branch out to a wider roster.

**You only need 2 healers and tanks at the start**, since you need to use at most 2 teams in the missions. Their attack types don't matter either, you only need to use the right DPS.

A good start to every account is upgrading ur Serina to 2\*, she's your best friend early on.

[Use this for investment targets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-lBJa3h4mXHkmuSKohoHe60WVVg1eRG9bA73jHqHzwA/edit#gid=702790264)

The 'best' units are the ones with a high score, but be aware that BA is a game of niches. 

![how to use excel](https://i.imgur.com/QHrepqU.png)
(for the 2nd guide/raid tierlist) 
Make sure to read the extra notes on the right as well. 

**You level up ur EX and regular skills based on raids and** (to a lesser degree) **PvP.** You can get by with only levels and equipment in PvE stuff.
You get the biggest impact investing into your DPS. Upgrading ur healers or buffers is also good, since you can use them in every damage type/colour. Tanks are generally fine with just levels and gear (specifically the 2nd equipment slot), so you can skimp out on their EX and regular skills.

Early on you prioritise: Levels > Gear > Skills

If you want to plan ahead with your investments, you can use [the planner](https://justin163.com/planner/) to see how much you exactly need. 
![Seeing your cool stuff](https://i.imgur.com/i1aXm3X.png)
If you want to know how much AP it costs to upgrade a student's gear [use this link](https://sensei.help/).

![Fandom Ligma](https://i.imgur.com/a9phNoj.png)
Taken from https://bluearchive.fandom.com/wiki/Divine_Fragment

From 3* to UE50 it costs 2400 elephs.

>Can I brick myself leveling up a student (e.g. Priconne)?
No. At most you brick yourself by levelling the worse characters. 

>Okay, now actually tell me who I should max out 
UE40 the anniversary units, Ako, and Himari.
Happy? 

## Normal and Hard missions
Puzzle gaming. Look at youtube videos (e.g. "Blue Archive Mission 3-5") or [use the wiki](https://bluearchive.wiki/wiki/Missions) if you don't know how to solve a puzzle (lol).

**Your goal is to go as far as you can in the normal mode for the cafe upgrades.** They drop every 3 areas at mission 5 and boost your daily AP recovery (this means 3-5, 6-5, ...). It's fine to 1\* a few missions, first time rewards only need the clear. 

**Don't forget to actually upgrade your cafe and max out the comfort level.**
![Ranking up the cafe](https://i.imgur.com/WgMiJXG.png)
(you can press that button) 
More comfort = more AP/energy. 

Recommended levels are a meme for missions, ignore them. You can beat missions 10-20 levels underneath the recommended levels. 

You can cancel the special ability of the boss and elite mod with a well-timed CC. This is especially handy against the elite tankers, who get damage reduction during their ability (which can cost you precious seconds). 
If you have trouble with the boss you can charge ur EX bar to 10 the battle before.

I'd recommendat using Tactical Supports. They can carry a lot of the missions by themselves. 

If you hit a limit with your progression, switch over from normal to hard mode. Do the same until you hit a wall there. Alternatively, drain ur AP and get a few extra levels (1 AP = 1 XP) before trying the same stage again.
You can refresh a hard node once a day for 3 extra sweeps. This is handy during rateup events, but generally not advised as it costs pyros. 
Farming a hard node for equipments is better than its normal counterpart.
Don't ever farm for BDs, the drop chance (2-5%) is abysmal. 

Every stage drops stuff for 2 and 3 tiers down of the respective equipment (e.g. t5 boots drop t3 and t2 boots). The lower tier stuff have a lower drop rate however. In addition, the left item also has a higher drop chance than the other 2 items. Example:
![19-1 drop rate](https://i.imgur.com/Z8Ws5DJ.png) 
(drop chance for 19-1) 

It's better to farm the equipment on their respective tier instead of trying to farm a higher one. E.g. don't farm t6 watch stages if you're trying to level up their watch from t3 -> t4. 

>Should I swipe my stages?
Yes.
There is no benefit to manually doing them.

>What equipments do I prioritise when I farm?
T4 bag for Tsubaki > T7 badge for Yuuka > Hats/Gloves > Watches > Rest  

>How many mission areas are there?
23 in Global, 24 in JP.

!!! info
	Go as far as you can in Normal missions, and when you hit a wall switch over to Hard mode and do the same. Stuck on both = time to sweep.

##Farmable units 
For a 3* you need 120 shards to unlock the student. A hard node drops on average 1 shard every day, so it takes 4 months to unlock a student. 

[Currently available units that you can farm](https://arch-img.b4k.co/vg/1679180130356.png) 
As of 19/03/23 (DD/MM/YY) ((the way it was meant to be formatted)) 

>What hard nodes should I farm?
![hard nodes to farm](https://i.imgur.com/zP1uCQN.png)
If you have to choose between farming a student that's on the tier that you own vs someone you don't own thats higher on the tier, choose the higher one. 
Example: you prioritise farming Iori (unowned) > Chise (owned) 

Someone's made a [student insight doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1BO-Uh_CsAOIetPjrNyFy9-7r1a4RAtVwK135bBC3hzM/htmlview#), check it out for a more detailed explanation on farmable units.

>Should I farm a unit I don't own?
Yes. With enough shards you can redeem her through the student list. The caveat being that it can take several months before you can actually redeem a specific student. 

>Do I prioritise unlocking all the characters or should I max out the good characters first? 
Up to you. There are good arguments for both options, it's very dependant. I personally lean on maxing out the good units first. 

>Should I keep farming a unit I maxed out? 
No. 

>Should I redeem X?
Eh.
It's more efficient waiting for a spook (non banner girl appearing through the gacha), because a dupe only gives you 30 shards if it's a 3\*. This effectively means you lose out on 90 shards by redeeming. You also need to consider if you have the mats to upgrade her afterwards, too. 
*However*, if there's a raid/content you want to clear or if you want an easier/comfier time it's fine to redeem.
If you think she's cute it's also cool to redeem. 

## Bounties
Your daily mats farm. 

School > Damage type (red) > Environment mood 
The bonuses are team-wide, so make sure to bring a good (ST) DPS for the rangers. E.g. Aru and Azusa. 
Blue units work too. 
The black ranger's special skill makes the target receive 50% extra damage, so you could try to cleanse it with someone like Mari. 

With a well timed CC you can cancel the rangers' special ability, so if you start to get melted make sure to use ur CC abilities to cancel their skills!
![CC in BA](https://i.imgur.com/dRYPRoE.png)

Always try to go for the highest tier you can clear. It drops lower tier mats as well, so there's no reason to farm a lower level.
You won't lose a ticket if you retreat, so you have infinite retries. 

>Which bounty area do I sweep?
If you need to ask, distribute ur tickets evenly. 
You could also do 1 area a day, and rotate it that way.

>What do I get from the Bounty shop?
See [the shop section](https://rentry.org/how2playba#shop). 

## Commissions
Ignore this until you can clear commission H (recommended level 65, but doable way below that), thank you.
Only farm commissions during rate up events if you did the above. 
Reports > credits
You'll run out of reports before you run out of credits. Consider changing your spending habits if the reverse holds true. 

Commissions is comprised of two modes: Base Defense and Item Retrieval.
Base Defense is a wave defense against small yellow armored enemies. You want to bring your best AOE yellow students and at least one tank. A useful trick is to use Serina to move your tank further ahead so they take 100% of the aggro from the waves of bots. This also prevents ur tank from running behind ur team. 
sHifumi is surprisingly VERY good here, able to solo carry your run. Regular Hifumi also works as an okay way to tank damage, giving you much needed breathing room if your tank melts too fast. 
Anyone you'd use for (indoors) Chesed works here. Think about Momoi, Cherino, Iori, Junko, Nonomi, Moe, Tsurugi, Sumire. 

Item Retrieval is a single-target blue challenge with a strict time limit. Bring your best ST blues, but ST yellows work fine too if you're lacking good blue students. There is no need to bring a tank or healer to this mode.
Any DPS you'd use for (urban) Shiro & Kuro works here. Think about Izuna, Haruna, Wakamo, sAzusa, Chise, mAris. 

## Scrimmages
The place you get mats to upgrade ur Exclusive Weapon (EW)/Unique Equipment (UE).
If you're not sure how to tackle it look at a youtube video. A common tactic uses Serina EX to reposition Tsubaki into their team, preventing most aoe from hitting your backline. 
Not worth farming until you clear at the very least B, and even then only once you start hitting 5\*s on your students. When you hit ultra lategame you can start skipping out on them, but don't neglect it too much. 

Feel free to skip during farmable events. 
With the small monthly you reduce the AP cost per ticket by 5, and with the big monthly you reduce it by 10. Buying both means that scrims become free to do.  

## Total Assault (Raid) & Grand Raid (Raid 2)
Welcome to the endgame content of BA, the biweekly *PREMIER* source of BDs, technotes, and elephs.
The first thing you want to do is join a club. The second thing is borrowing the strongest unit for the raid. Congrats you just beat the raid.

Read up on what the boss does and how to tackle it with [the raid guide.](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1bvYGwIh-9o-2JQ4Q2MQXtsL0peiCPrRuw0l3HQmTrZ0)
Alternatively look up some clears or guides on YouTube. E.g. "Blue Archive Binah Guide". The [/bag/ banner guide](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRXlcitXUjd848IYKTmI_NUwc7FT1-fJXJaJj86EACxMe_M_nix6LMZUxlQYDsoKgezzVNsxRcAQqbJ/pubhtml) also has a "cope" section for some raids. 

Up to Hardcore you can borrow someone's hypercarry who can beat the raid by herself, just build a decent supporting team around her.
Don't try Extreme without a mock battle if ur below the recommended level.
You can do Extreme at level 70, Insane at level 80, and Torment after 2 years of playing. This holds generally true for most raids. 

If you're a pro raid gamer, it's good practice to set a time you'll stop resetting for a high score and finish the raid. Getting a cool gamer score is not worth losing a ticket over. My advice is 15-20 minutes before the ticket ends .

If you need to change formation in the middle of ur raid battle, you can close the app/quit the game and start Blue Archive again. This way you won't lose ur ticket, your attempt will stay active, AND you get to change ur team/positioning/starting EX skills. 
This works in mock battles and actual runs. 
In JP there is a button for this. 

See the [shop section](https://rentry.org/how2playba#shop) for what to buy. 

Groggy/stun meters are the small bars underneath the boss' HP bar. If applicable, they only fill up if you use the correct damage type.
E.g. For Binah (yellow) I can use Mika (yellow) to fill the bar and stun the snake, but I can't stun the snake with Aru (red) no matter how much damage she deals. 

>I forgot if I started a mock battle or a real run, help! 
In battle, at the top left of your screen it shows if it's a mock battle. If there isn't a notice, it's a real run. 

>Should I save my raid coins? 
No. There's a limit on every item you can buy, and the shop refreshes before a new raid. Don't be a retard. 
You don't lose your coins after a refresh. 

>in Grand Raids/Elimination Raids I saw that there's a 10 roll ticket, does it expire? 
Yes. The ticket expires on the last day of the next month after the raid. So it has a limit of around 40 days. 
Example: the ticket from the Grand Raid of February expires on the 31st of March. 

## Joint Firing Drill/Joint Exercise 
!!! Warning LOOK AT A YOUTUBE VIDEO
It's commissions but with a unique gimmick. The gimmick changes every time, so no 2 drills are the same. 
If you don't know what to do against a gimmick, look at a few videos. If it's ongoing, filter by 1 week and you should be good.

You can borrow students for this challenge, so being in a club is very helpful if you want to get a good score.
There are no rankings (like raids), and higher scores simply give you more coins/credits per clear.

The tickets for Joint Firing Drill (JFD) work differently than the ones for raids. Unlike with raids, you will not waste a ticket by retreating in battle. You'll only waste the ticket if you give up entirely (in the stage menu) or the sixty minute timer on the ticket runs out.
Once you have used up an entire ticket (3 clears), you are able to sweep your remaining tickets.

It's not worth it to hyperinvest into someone for only the JFD. Just take the L, do a lower difficulty, and move on.

If you're feeling lazy you can auto stage 1/2/3. 

Look at the [shop section](https://rentry.org/how2playba#shop) if you need advice on what to buy.

## Tactical Challenge (PvP)
!!!warning VERY FRUSTRATING GAMEMODE, BEWARE 

The goal of PvP is to match your attack type with the enemy's armour type, while mismatching their attack type with your armour type. 
Use [the following tierlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1NiLS4DloW7A92nIh5n5wl9uYkLAuYa-7Ph-u8RXVjik/htmlview#) to build your team around. 
General advice is to use a double tank setup + Shun, with good supports. Tsubaki and Yuuka are usually your goto. 

You can skip the battle if you don't like to be in pain. 
The pvp coins claim reset takes place 10 hours after the daily reset, which is why it's better to do your pvp battles AFTER the pvp coin reset. This is because your rewards are dependant on what rank you are at that exact moment. Basically do pvp at the same time as your 'login after X' daily mission.
No, you can not turn off the auto button in battle. 

## Shop
The place where u buy stuff and rub Sora's forehead.
**The only items that rotate in the shop are the artifacts in the credit store.** 

>Normal shop (or credit shop) 
Buy out the artifacts/OOParts in the normal shop at the bottom every day, until you have a nice stack of 200 of the target item. Buy the enhancement stones *only if you need them*.
Buying the activity reports with credits is kind of bad (as in really bad), so don't do that. 

>Eleph shops
You max out your wife. After that? You max the alt of your wife (she has an alt right?)
Otherwise bring Serina to 2\*. After that? You post your roster in the /bag/ general and ask for help. It's faster that way. 
Don't use ur elephs for [farmable characters](https://rentry.co/how2playba#farmable-units) if you can, they're quite literally farmable.

Ignore eleph shop 2. It has some good stuff in it, but elephs are a really rare resource. Do not brick yourself and buy the secret note here. Do not. 

>Raid shop
![For me, Hanako is SSS tier. Buy her elephs NOW](https://i.imgur.com/wBDFItJ.png)

Don't get the secret tech note until you actually need it. You use it to bring your regular skills from 9 -> 10, which aren't a bottleneck until you're well into your BA tenure. Besides that ur free to buy whatever you need.
I personally recommend buying stuff for the current and next raid.

- "idk what to buy, which BDs/technotes do I pick?" 

Gehenna/Millennium/Trinity. They're the 3 biggest schools, and they have a lot of meta students. You'll always be needing their mats. Always. 

>PvP shop
**Save ur shit for AP drinks, maybe buy Utaha. Maybe.**

In general you want to save up your coins so you get to buy out the pvp drinks during events. If there's a girl that appeals to you feel free to buy her. Utaha is the most 'meta' character in this shop, as her UG makes her a top pvp support. She requires a lot of investment however. 
Don't buy the reports or credits, they really really suck. You can buy the drinks and farm commissions for a better efficiency 
Consider bringing Shizuko to 3\* when a Shirokuro raid is approaching. 

If you ever want to unlock any of the 3\*s available that's fine, theyre just very very niche. Don't expect them to be good. 

In case you didn't realise, you can refresh the pvp shop with pvp coins, NOT with pyros. This way you get to buy out the pvp drinks 4x (also known as pvp refreshing) 
![How to refresh the shop](https://i.imgur.com/T9Wf7p5.png)

>Joint Firing Drill/Joint Exercise shop
**Elephs > whatever > artifacts**

I'll go over every item, just know that this shop is a lot more nuanced. You can pick anything and it'd be decent. 

- Artifacts
I don't recommend buying out the artifacts, except when you absolutely need to. Even though you can't get these artifacts through bounty, there are a lot of events where you can farm them. You also get an okayish chunk through raids.

- Reports
The safest option if you don't know what to pick. They're purple, they're FREE\*, and you'll always need them. They're REALLY expensive though, so you usually skip them in favour of the other options. 

- Shards
Tsurugi > Eimi > Sumire. 
Eimi is a solid tank, and Sumire and Tsurugi are both yellow aoe dps frontliners. Unfortunately, there are better alternatives to Eimi, and the only place Sumire and Tsurugi shine in is in (indoors) Chesed as a 2nd or 3rd option.
I personally prioritise buying them out since elephs are hard to obtain, the shards are nice to have, and because I don't have much need for the other options.
If you buy them out, eventually you'll no longer need to buy them too. Eventually. 

- Fusion stones 
With the fusion stones you can convert a surplus of a certain type of mat into a different mat in the crafting chamber (the 2nd one). It really helps bridging the gaps in your stash at a decent price.
I'm personally using the gold ones to convert gifts into the ones I need, but most of the time you won't need these things. They're very handy when you need them, so having a decent stack of them can come in handy (don't buy the grey ones though). About 40 of each would be my recommendation. 

- Secret tech note 
They're okay. If you need them they're handy. I always buy them, but I'm 2 years into the game.  

>Mastery Certificate/Expert Permit shop
(After you hit MAX level, 1 AP = 1 Mastery Cert)
![expert permit priority](https://i.imgur.com/gZ2b8lv.png) 
According to [this korean post](https://gall.dcinside.com/mgallery/board/view/?id=projectmx&no=3931989), the priority is:
Credits > Limited Elephs (that you need) > Pins (if you need) > Eligma > Reports
Everything depends on your needs at the time though, and you can just buy whatever you want.
You can't unlock/redeem limited students through this shop, so don't buy them if you don't have them (or plan to).
The gear blueprints are a godsend though. Everything about this shop is honestly. Thank you, John Nexon. 

- Can I redeem limited units if I buy their elephs?


READ NIGGA READ
![how2read (not to be confused with how to read)](https://i.imgur.com/LCmON51.png)

>Bounty shop
Every month a new shop, save ur stuff for (good) artifacts only. You can get BDs/technotes from the raid shop, so I wouldn't recommend buying them here.
It's fine to skip a shop if you don't need anything from it that month. Try to limit ur purchases to t4 artifacts too.

## Crafting Chamber

>Material Synthesis (the normal one)
**Radiant (purple mats) >= Blu-ray Disks > Furniture (if not capped yet in cafe) > Flower (gifts) >= Shiny (orange mats) > Rest**

**Don't do the tier 2 and 3 nodes if you're still strapped for mats.** If you need to ask if you have enough: you don't. I personally only throw in mats if they have an excess of 200. 

In case it wasn't clear yet: you get furniture to cap the energy generation from your cafe. 

If you want to go to node 2: use t1-2 mats you don't care about. Not crafting keystones.

For the T3 node (only do this if ur a oldfag/whale): **Diamond (secret tech note) > Flower > Radiant > Shiny > Abundance (credits) > Mystic (elephs) > The Rest**
The only reason to farm t3 nodes at this point is for the gifts, you'll have enough of everything else to spend it on getting here. 
You can spin the wheel with the Radiant, Abundance, and Mystic options for more entertaining results. I personally always get assmad doing them, but they are very entertaining. 

>Material Fusion (the new one)
Trading your garbage away for the freshest sneaks
**Do not get the raffle ticket**, the choice ticket is the one you want. Raffle tickets give you a random item, if you prefer these seek help. 

You can dump excessive mats from useless schools (like Red Winter, Shanghai, Arius, and SRT) into a better one. The useless schools only have 1-2 characters you want to max out anyway. Gaps in your artifact stash can also be helped bridged. 

You can also trade your useless furnitures away for a specific one you want, which is pretty neat. If it's worth the purple fusion stone is for you to decide. 

You're able to combine ur raid statues into a display one, which let's you see your past raid rankings 

>Misc. info
Feel free to use the speedup tickets, you'll have a billion of them lying around. 
There has never been a 2x event on the crafting chamber, so there's no point in saving your keystones. 

## Events
(the story ones, not 2x ones)
Go to https://justin163.com/planner/events
Fill it in, it'll tell you what to do. 

>Important stuff to know 
**Always do story mission 1 first**, just in case there's a welfare unit. 

The highest bonus will be saved, so if you 1\* a quest stage with the max bonus then 3\* it with a different team, you can sweep the stage and get the highest bonus. This also works vice versa (first 3\*, then 1\* with max bonus). 

Example:
Stage 1 drops 20x and 15y. 
Team with 100% bonus for x clears stage 1 with 1\*
Stage 1 now drops 40x and 15y (1\*)
Team with 100% bonus for y clears stage 1 with 1\*
Stage 1 now drops 40x and 30y (1\*)
Team that's not dogshit clears stage 1 with 3\*
Stage 1 now drops 40x and 30y (3\*) 

You unlock the welfare/free unit by doing the story missions (the very 1st one). Do this before you farm the quest stages.

>I can only clear up to stage X. What do I do? 
- Do the story and farm the highest stage tier you can sweep (again, go to https://justin163.com/planner/events)
- Buy out the high priority stuff from the shop first (Artifacts > BDs > Technotes > whatever > Furniture)
- Buy from T4 -> T1.


What you're supposed to do is a case by case scenario though, since some events are pretty shit to farm, or some artifacts and schools are worse than others. You can always ask in the thread 

Always try to go for a cafe upgrade before you do event stuff if you can.

Regardless, you're pretty fucked so gl bro

>The event features characters from the main story, but I haven't read that part yet. What do I do?
Do the event missions, but skip the story. You get the gem rewards and occassionally a welfare unit too, and you can always read the story later. Go to Story > Replay > Event Story.

>I have X shards of this event's welfare unit but I can't claim her wtf! 
DO THE STORY MISSIONS 
![how2get welfare](https://i.imgur.com/GDRuTBG.png)

### Hoarding before an event 
Generally only do this for 3x campaigns, if the week before it is dead, or if it's a really good farming event 

You can save up some extra AP right before an event to splurge on the event. This way every AP you spend is worth several times its normal value, vastly outweighing the small loss you take from missing out on daily regen AP (if you are saving for several days). 

If you want a specific guide, use:
![how to hoard AP guide](https://i.imgur.com/Dkfc0EV.png)
[(the old one for preservation sake)](https://i.imgur.com/nq3vsPW.png) 

Bounties/Scrimmages: **if and only if (I.F.F.) you buy the monthlies**, you can save those extra tickets by not doing your bounties for a fat bonus during rate ups. Be aware that your free daily tickets will go to waste, but the bonus you get outweighs the 6 tickets you lose out on. 

## Whaling for dummies
![pakeji value](https://i.imgur.com/IIrB9LU.png)
Buy out the new player gems first, the numbers are crazy. 
If you're planning on being a dolphin, like all gacha games the best value pakejis are the monthly/bimonthly ones. More bounty tickets, making scrimmages AP free, and a good pyro income.

The 1 dollar Serika is nice, but pretty unneeded. 

I'm not a big spender so I can't give too much of an opinion on the other packs. The anniversary selectors seem cool though, definitely worth a zinger box or two.

## Main story stuff (spoiler free) 
(WIP)
Every episode grants 60 gems.

Ordered by release date:
Volume 1 > V2C1 > V3C1-3 > V4C1 > V3C4 > V2C2 > Volume F > V4C2 > V5C1

You can also read it by volume.

-	Chapter 1 has 20 episodes
-	Chapter 2 has 20 episodes

Total: 2400 gems 

Volume 2 has 2 chapters

Completing volume F gives you a new login screen, and so does reading the epilogue of Volume 4 chapter 2. 

>can I change back my login screen? 
No. 

>WTF I'm stuck in the story help! It's at volume 3 chapter 3 episode 24 (v3 c3 e24) 
[Example clear](https://youtu.be/lwA4emYpp_k), every newbie gets stuck on that. I'd recommend attempting it at level 40-50

>What does D.U. mean?
District of Utnapishtim.


## Misc. stuff
You can rub people's heads after you unlock their L2Ds. This also counts for NPCs (e.g. Arona, Sora, Rin)
Yes. You really can. 

>XP
1 AP = 1 XP. Your level is tied to how much AP you spend, so there's no real way to level up faster. 
You can 3x refresh your AP for 90 gems a day, which is kind of good. Whether it's worth it is for you to decide. I personally suggest not to. 

MAX level is current level cap + 1 xp off the next level (e.g. if the cap is 20, MAX would be 1 xp off lvl 21)

>Relationship levels 
The max level is 10 below 3\*, 20 at 3-4\*, and 100 at 5\*. 
[The wiki's affection calculator](https://bluearchive.wiki/wiki/Affection) is a pretty good resource to calculate ur affection with. Make sure to actually scroll down. 
[There's also the korean version](https://arona.ai/calc/favor) of the calculator, and there's *also* a [spreadsheet that provides a detailed breakdown of how affection works](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dmB2v7zeR3ja-tjUW92oawNaNGYB1FVtIrE4K8hXE2A) 

>Maxing out affection/bond/relationship level
Use https://rentry.org/bondarchive [(image version)](https://i.imgur.com/zMOdCsg.png)
Very useful!
 
>Friends
Need a friend or two?
Add a couple of /bag/ bros from [the friend google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hUDz9eM25BabBxn7GHXemnhZl3ZSdxpAcJGIvxmFjqM/).
If you want to help a future newfag or would like to put urself up there yourself, [feel free to add yourself to the spreadsheet by filling out the form](https://forms.gle/Y5BKx17EQaawVTqLA). Entries will be automatically removed after 30 days. It's also completely anonymous, so don't worry.
 
>AP
Any AP that crosses the max limit (999) gets sent to your bank. It expires in 7 days, so make sure to spend it at some point.

>Lessons
For the Schale areas: at rank 10 you unlock receiving choice tickets on top of the regular drops when you're doing your lessons. Pretty neat
The max rank for an area is 12.
Increasing ur Total Area Rank also unlocks extra daily lesson tickets, in case you didn't realise. There's a 7th ticket you can unlock at rank 80. 
At Lesson Area <10 you get 15 relationship points, Area 11 it's 20, and 12 it's 25.  When you get a BONUS, it means that students receives double the points. 
 
>Normal Missions
The XP your students are supposed to get when you manually farm a node gets converted into a grey activity report while sweeping. At certain breakpoints this gets converted into a higher tier report.
This part I'm a little unsure about, but I think it's every 5 sweeps you get a blue report and every 30 sweeps you get an orange report. So ideally you'd sweep in multiples of 5 or 30.
It's a pretty negligible trick though. 

For every level below the recommended level you'll start doing 2% less damage while taking 2% more dmg, up to 20 levels. If you ever wonder why it gets so hard progressing, that's why. This is compared between student and enemy level, not Sensei level. 
Very important to keep in mind is that you can ignore the recommended level. Until you actually can't get further, ignore it. Otherwise you block urself mentally, instead of the game stopping you. 

One-time per battle skills can happen once in every battle.
E.g. You're doing 1-4 with Tsubaki, and in 1-4 there are 3 enemies you have to fight. For every fight in 1-4 she can proc her heal once for a total of three times. 

>Maxing out affection/bond/relationship level with crafting 
Use https://rentry.org/bondarchive [(image version)](https://i.imgur.com/zMOdCsg.png)

It's a small guide on maximising your wife's affection level (the autistic minmax way), and it has some neat info as well. I'd recommend skimming through it at least once. 

>Daily and weekly missions
Doing stage 1 of commissions for the daily mission is pretty worth. 20 mastery certificates for the price of 5 AP? That's a steal. Doing the weekly commission is kind of decent (3 orange reports for 75 AP), although I don't do it personally. 
 
The weekly missions reset on Sunday (the reset from Sunday to Monday). 

You can save weekly missions for several days during the week, in case you want to claim it on Friday instead of Tuesday (e.g. saving the extra AP to use on 2x hard instead of 2x normals). It doesn't carry over to another week though, so use it before the weekly reset. 

It's worth it to do the 20x missions + 3x hard nodes daily, even during 2x commissions. 

>Birthdays/holidays 
If you switch out from the L2D, on (birth/holi)days your assistant gives you a unique dialogue if you tap her. 

>Cafe
You can headpat a girl again after 3 hours from the last time you did, giving you 4 opportunities every cafe reset. 

>Stacking (de)buffs
You can stack several (de)buffs with the same descriptor/effect, but only if they're in different skill slots. 
E.g. I can stack Akane's EX skill DEF down with Maki's basic skill, and sAzusa's sub skill. I can't stack Akane's DEF down with Noa's, Hiyori's, or Mine's DEF down as they are on the same skill slot. 
There is some nuance here: sHoshino's ATK buff EX stacks with Himari/Kotama's ATK buff EX for example, but generally (de)buffs in the same skill slot don't stack. 

# FAQ
>Is it too late to play? 
No.

>When is a good time to start? 
The best time to start was yesterday, the second best time to start is right now. This holds true for any bonsai game. 
If you're playing the game for a specific girl, I'd still suggest playing now even if she's limited. Better to find out if you like the game now than wait and be disappointed later. You also get more time to farm a spark. 

>How grindy is BA? 
It follows every gacha formula of having a lot of stuff to do in the first week/month, but after that you just do your dailies and log off. Dailies can take 5-10 minutes. 
From my very limited experience playing other gachas (Arknights, limbus, some old mobile phone games), I'd say it's definitely on the very low side for daily maintenance. The sweep mechanic helps a lot in this regard.

You can 'grind' a bit more trying to get to the latest cafe upgrade, or by trying a raid difficulty that's above (or at) your level. The reward for doing so is nice, but not significant enough to feel bad about skipping it. 

>How do you choose your student wife
You don't choose her. She chooses you. 
The best way I can describe it is that everything just 'clicks'. You might not find her for months, maybe even years, and that's okay. You'll know when it happens. Yes, I am being cringe.

> I'm AP capped! What do I spend it on?
You spend it on whatever event is currently running. If it's a dead week (e.g. only 2x scrimmages) it's:
Hard missions > Normal missions > Commissions.
Commissions are only worth it during campaign events, and only if you can farm the orange report, which are available at level H+. The credit commissions are decent too, so if ur poor you can sweep them. 

> I don't have any credits/reports what do I do!
You pretend nothing's wrong and do the same what you're already doing.
You can get pink reports in the Joint Exercise Shop, and you can get reports AND credits from the Mastery Certificate Shop. 
There's also technically the reports you can buy in the normal shop for credits, but those are a scam. 

>I just missed the X banner, will she get a rerun?
Students attached to a story event get a rerun, including limited units. Otherwise the chance is pretty slim.
See https://bluearchive.wiki/wiki/Banner_List for future banners.

If it's a limited unit they seem to be getting a yearly rerun. Anniversary units can be rolled during anniversary banners, but aren't sparkable until 1,5 years after their initial banner (this is a guess however). 

>Should I join a (/bag/) club? 
Yes. It's 10 AP daily, an extra source of credits, and it lets you borrow hyper invested students for Total Assault, Joint Exercise, and Conquest.
See https://rentry.org/holdingthebag for /bag/ clubs.

No one cares if you don't use the chat or can't lend out "good" students. You're there as a piggybank for the whales to earn some extra credits. 

>Do 2x/3x events apply on the first time clear rewards? 
No. 
I wish they did too. 

>I can't beat X what do I do? 
Go on youtube and look at a video. You'll find that is the answer to a lot of problems in life. 

>What is UE / EW? 
Unique Equipment, or Exclusive Weapon in Global. 
It's the gun. 

UE1 = UE30, UE2 = UE40, etc. You can use them interchangeably. 

>What is UG / UI? 
Unique Gear, or Unique Item in global. 
It's the 4th equipment.
You can find out what gift you need for the t2 upgrade [on the wiki here](https://bluearchive.wiki/wiki/Unique_gear_list).

>How does X stat work? 
See [this link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ui0FRgG8h8RB1-cA639F3ETDrVM7q9FKftg4vBKBAAQ). 

>How do servers work? What server am I in.
There are 3 game versions right now: JP, Global, and CN. 
JP is Japan, which is ~5 month ahead of Global. 
Global is divided in 5 different regions: Global (= EU), NA, Asia, Taiwan, and Korea.
CN is the Chinese server, which is behind JP and Global by 2 years.
You can only join clubs or add friends from the same region. 

If you wish to start in a different region for Global, you'll need to set your VPN to a country of that server *before* you create/start your account. 

![how to find out your server](https://i.imgur.com/J0Mt5pr.png)

>When did X change get added 
You'll have to manually look for it. 
Go to https://bluearchive.wiki/wiki/Events, open an event, and underneath Event Summary > details you can find new additions.

>Where is the AV room? (Hanako mission)
Schale office > Schale theatre room. It's bottom left. 

>How long does it take to reach max level
You can calculate how long it takes [here](https://futottakakka.github.io/bluearchive-expcalc/expcalc.html) 

![XP requirements](https://i.imgur.com/AVCuFgu.png)
At max cafe you get ~930 AP a day, but with pvp drinks and refreshes I'd guess it to be anywhere between 7-9 months.

>How do I get a coloured name in my ID? I see accounts that have this. 
It got patched out. You used to be able to add a hexcode in ur name for it, but the method got patched. The colour stayed.
