It's a Friday night and I don't know what the hell I'm supposed to be doing right now.

Well that's a bit of a lie, I've got a dozen or so assignments due next week it's just that the only thing I can muster myself up to do right now is continue to browse moddb's Half-Life 2 section in hopes of finding some sort of inspiration for my current project. Apparently it looks good on your resume when you can show that you worked on some sort of video game project, as small as a mod may be, so thank God I can mentally justify myself endlessly procastinating.

As for what's currently on moddb: not much. I've already burnt myself out "looking for inspiration" in everything that took more effort than "babby's first source project" so I've just designated myself to playing all the mediocre garbage that gets uploaded in the "Past 24hours" section.

And what I just found fits exactly that description:

"halflife3reimagined"

The mod, having a very low quality image of the Gman as its thumbnail, has this brilliant work of literature for its summary page:

"Play Gordon Freeman New Mod Fight Combine! 

You Are Freeman on Mission: Destroy Combine !Fight Against Enemies, Save Humans !Only You, Can Stop Evil!"

Besides that beautiful piece of prose that is either the result of America's shoddy education system or some brain-dead esl tard, the rest of the mod page oozes with child-like perfection. The creator's name is "henry.powell513@gmail.com", the images section is just a compilation of other extremely low quality images of various Half-Life characters. God had truly blessed me to be this mod's first playtester.

Recognizing the mission I had been tasked with, I dutifully download the mod and boot it up at a moment's notice, expecting that at the very least I would come out half an hour later with a big smile on my face from how hilariously awful the entire thing would be put together.

In less than twenty seconds all my hopes are immediately dashed as I realize that I've been needlessly hyping myself up for the past ten minutes over what was just a singular room with a dozen or so combine in it. Feeling peeved by what I just played I immediately send a message over moddb to Henry Powell.

"Hey, I just played your mod 'halflife3reimagined' and I wanted to know if that's the entire thing or if you're planning on adding more to it?"

An hour later, I receive a response:

"More !Expect More Soon!"

So I waited, and a week later I receive another message back from him:

"Check Out Mod! New Update"

In his message he links to the mod page so I head over to it, download v2 of halflife3reimagined, boot it up and see that instead of a singular room with a dozen combine enemies it's two rooms with two dozen combine enemies.

So after I'm done playing I send a message back:

"Hello. Got done playing v2 of your mod. You still planning on updating it again?"

An hour later I receive the same kind of response as last time:

"Yes ! More Soon Just Wait!"

So I did wait, and next week he messaged me about updating it again, I played it again, I noticed that he added just a little bit more again, I afterwards messaged him about updating the mod and he responded that he was gonna do so soon again.

This cycle went on for a couple of months and overtime
