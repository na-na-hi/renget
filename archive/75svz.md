    i have a cut ending from a story as "lore"
    the tl;dr of it is chespin's friends in the human world weren't good people, would frequently forget about him
!!!note linoone
    @chespin you did say that in a story
    where Chespin explained to wooper human friendships were not like the one he had with Wooper
!!!info chespin
    well i guess the secret SECRET lore was that chespin just plain hated them.

    @chespin oof

    the gutted ending to a story was basically chespin getting drunk off Red Gummi drink (which intensified emotions) while talking about them late one night
    anyways, the reason chespin's so clingy with wooper is due to how bad his old friends had been

    Wooper's got some ultra secret lore
    So secret i cant talk about it
    wooper's secret lore was actually planned for a story
    A story i had an idea for in April
    said story is still "coming eventually"
