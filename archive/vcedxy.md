>within the city you felt kind of shocked
>actual humans 
>Tails was very conscious of the area and had a semblance of shame
>Sonic… that was a different story
>he had no shame
>hooked onto your arm as you investigated 
>it hadn't taken long for Robotnik to make his move
>some slime creature accosting cops had to have him involved 
>then his robots came out of the woodwork
>Sonic was really the real deal when things called for it
>seeing him tear through robots and fighting that monster impressed you
>you really did have a super hero chasing after your dick
>Tails had foiled a separate ploy to blow up the city
>over the course of your city trip you did realize how out of your depth you were
>you'd become the Lois Lane here
>Sonic and Tails would never allow you in danger and they'd gotten really good at keeping you safe
>the issue was you were worried about them not being safe
>usually these isekai things ended with a guy having super powers
>but you were just… you
>hell, the city's gratitude was the only reason you could get a meal
>your money was pretty useless on another world
>let no one tell you a good deed goes unrewarded 
>but you did feel slightly guilty
>you wanted to be more than just a trophy wife here
>if those two were putting in the effort you should too
>your solution came from a source you didn't expect
>one day you were stuck in safety when you ran into a familiar pink hedgehog 
>things were… difficult 
>sure
>very awkward 
>she'd come out of the casino that Sonic and Tails had cleared out awhile before
>at first you tried pretending you were buried in your phone
>but she wasn't fooled and instantly went for your bench
>she poked your chest
>”you've got a lot of nerve.”
>she wasn't happy
>you couldn't blame her
>you wouldn't be happy to be cucked 
>to your credit Sonic was very very gay
>you brought up how you were kind of stuck here while those two went on their world saving and she sort of relented
>you apologized for how things went down 
>she did relax a little
>time seemed to heal the wounds a little
>not completely but you weren't dodging a hammer
>you patted the bench and asked her if she would hear you out a little
>you didn't expect forgiveness but you also had no idea what had gone on
>you weren't even from here
>that did at least seem to get through
>”so what do you want?”
>there was still a little edge to her voice 
>not completely hostile but she didn't exactly trust you
>fair
>you had to ask an outside party
>how could you be useful?
>you were defenseless in the face of the odds Sonic dealt with
>even she seemed more capable
>you were just a guy
>you didn't want to just be someone to be rescued, an easy target
>that gave her pause
>she sat down next to you, readjusting her skirt
>you remembered Sonic mentioning in passing he'd saved her
>but why did she need saving?
>she was plenty strong
>you didn't mention this but you knew she'd have a decent perspective 
>you felt useless here and you didn't want to feel useless
>she opened up and admitted what you knew about Sonic saving her
>the metal Sonic 
>a whole adventure 
>then he ran off
>she thought it was love at first sight
>she sighed and looked down
>you felt a little guilty 
>glancing over to her, you didn't know how to deal with this
>she thought Sonic saved her because he loved her
>but he was just being a hero
>it just came naturally to him
>that gave you an epiphany 
>Sonic would probably still be heroic even without the speed
>Amy here overcame odds
>moping about it wouldn't do anything 
>you'd just have to rise to the occasion
>you'd originally treated this adventure as an extended vacation
>yet both Sonic and Tails were saving people
>so you should shape up
>who knows, maybe you'd save them for a change 
>Amy looked crestfallen
>you apologized again for the mess that happened 
>you pointed out Sonic saved her because that's just who he is
>he'd save anyone
>no way would you bring up your relationship with him at the moment
>no need to make the wounds worse
>she'd recover and find someone
>you knew that the dating game was hard no matter where you were
>she just didn't need to give up
>and neither did you
>you told her to keep in touch and not go solo as much
>you knew you weren't her favorite person right now but Robotnik wasn't above kidnapping before
>”you should watch out too”
>she still sounded a little on edge but you hoped she'd be over it eventually 
>you weren't giving up those guys now
>rivals be damned 
>it took a little while before Sonic and Tails came back 
>you'd ended up sharing lunch with Amy and they practically froze when they saw her
>she ended up dismissing herself but thanked you for the meal
>after the initial awkwardness the two guys sat down with you
>as grateful as the city was at its new heroes, you did feel a few judgemental stares
>the hedgehog in a skimpy swimsuit with a pink tied up shirt 
>sitting in your lap didn't help
>he just hopped there like he owned it
>you knew you'd have to clean up that free hotel room you all had earned after you all had privacy
>at least people were grateful around here
>Tails fumbled around with some new technology he'd brought back while Sonic described the excursion 
>you suggested coming with the next time and Sonic lost the jovial smile to tell you absolutely not
>you wanted to help
>they were out there
>they'd fought that slime a second time
>met their friend Knuckles
>and fought a ton of robots
>you were just here
>”and you're going to stay put until Robotnik is dealt with.”
>he poked your nose for emphasis 
>it was rare to see him assertive but you were proposing getting into harm's way
>but wasn't he doing the exact same?
>he was about to bring up he had powers
>but you dismissed that
>he'd do the right thing even without them
>what you'd realized earlier was both these two were heroic even without the weirdness they had going for them
>you suggested taking this discussion upstairs to your room and Sonic agreed
>that was the quickest way to get his attention 
>being stuck cooped up in the city at least made this visit a little more special
>you knew those two would be eager for stress relief
>you could at least do that much
>the discussion about you being more help could come later with the possible help of post nut clarity helping your case
>in the bedroom Sonic instantly lost all his assertiveness
>you decided the talk could wait afterwards and picked them both up once the door shut behind you
>firm hand on each their asses, you walked over to the bed
>that poor bed had seen some use since you'd arrived in Station Square
>the whole deviant sex with these was tolerated but not exactly normal around these parts
>you noticed how people would sometimes gawk at Sonic wearing the fruitiest number possible 
>maybe it was the giant hedgehog thing
>granted, they seemed aware of these anthro people
>why they secluded themselves to one island you hadn't the faintest idea
>but the place was nice
>it didn't give a thrill to be able to pick them both up at once
>Tails wouldn't admit he liked it but he did wiggle in your palm just a little
>Sonic clung to you, even tracing a finger over your chest
>you could only lift them both for a sort burst but it was enough to show off
>you couldn't lie and say you weren't also excited to see them
>the hedgehog grabbed at your crotch and chuckled 
>”hope you missed me”
>you did
>you palmed both their asses when you sat down on the bed
>both of them arched themselves closer to you
>you hoped after a clearer head that you could reason through to them 
>you understood just where they were coming from
>but you didn't want to be useless
>you felt pretty useless
>here though, you were in control 
>you took turns kissing each guy
>they'd been so pent up on whatever quest had come their way
>no wonder they both practically begged you with their body language 
>it was hard not to want to enjoy yourself a little here
>both of them rested on one leg, Sonic in particular grinding up against it
>Tails was still shy about it but a few kisses relaxed him
>you still wanted to be more than just this to them though
>you knew you mattered
>but being useful was hard to define 
>their asses were on the line
>why shouldn't you be concerned?
>want to help?
>you'd strike at the pillow talk phase 
>right now though…
>your palm gripped Sonic's cheek and he moaned
>you'd enjoy yourselves 
>you whispered into the hedgehogs ear
>you hoped he wasn't too tired to keep up
>the taunt worked
>he bopped you in the arm
>you couldn't help it if he was a… slowpoke
>that earned you another bop
>he grinned
>you didn't want to leave Tails out and started kissing his shoulder
>that was a weak spot 
>he gripped at your shirt and leaned in
>then you were back to Sonic
>it was a challenge keeping both of them satisfied 
>but you were up to the task
>you had to say, as stressful as this new world was, this was a benefit 
>Sonic didn't go to much into foreplay this time
>he'd snatched up the bottle of lube on your nightstand and started undoing your jeans
>one thing you were happy about this city was being able to get a few changes of clothes
>Sonic and Tails didn't exactly share your pants size
>Tails climbed off your leg to let his friend yank your pants down
>you made yourself busy undoing his coveralls, surprising him
>Sonic buried himself in your exposed crotch and kissed your nuts while you undressed the fox 
>you'd probably give first dibs to the hedgehog 
>him moving up and suckling on your tip was clouding your judgment 
>his fingers were working lube into his ass 
>with Tails completely nude you pulled him close and attacked his nipple 
>one palm on his ass and the other on Sonic’s head
>you enjoyed yourself a little
>yeah this world could be great 
>despite earlier fears, they worked together well
>neither came off as jealous
>they were content to share
>and you felt relief over that
>the whole situation was nuts without a love triangle 
>they would be the death of you though
>Sonic was already a handful
>thank God Tails was far more shy
>they had ganged up on you and your world was a blur of heat and fur
>Sonic passionately kissed your cock while Tails thrust his chest up to your mouth
>cool lube replaced the hot mouth and you could tell someone was impatient 
>several pounds of ass impaled itself on your dick was one fluid motion
>your cock vanished inside him with a groan escaping his lips
>you growled into the fox's fluffy chest 
>Sonic had taken your taunt as a challenge and was riding you reverse cowgirl
>cowboy?
>well he was putting his hips into it while you practically devoured the shy fox
>Tails whimpered when you grabbed the base of his tails
>not hard enough to hurt, just enough to get his attention 
>your other hand ran over Sonic's slim chest as you held on along for the ride
>he almost instantly shot a load after hopping on your dick
>Tails was trying not to make it obvious he was grinding against you
>the whole thing was a blur but you did notice the wet stains on your shirt quickly enough
>you snatched one of Sonic’s hands and placed his lubed up fingers right near the fox's tailhole
>he didn't need to be told what to do next and soon Tails was clinging and scratching at your shirt as you got finger fucked
>your hand drifted from Sonic’s chest down to his cock and you tried pumping him with the timing of his thrusts down 
>at least the best you could without acquiring carpal tunnel 
>he arched his back and came pretty quickly with your hand coaching things along
>without warning he hopped off as easily as he hopped on and grabbed Tails by the waist and impaled his friend on your dick 
>all before bot the fox and you could react
>Tails nearly bit his tongue and you fought the urge to cum
>”I didn't want to hog it all to myself. sharing is caring isn't it?”
>he pushed Tails legs up in the air and started kissing the fox
>you had a front row seat to the debauchery and you clamped your hands on Sonic's hips
>he broke the kiss confused and looked over Tails’ shoulder
>”hey, I think you're ignoring the main attraction here”
>you pushed him against the fox and they both moaned when they frotted against each other
>that cleared things up for the hedgehog 
>you grabbed Sonic by the hips and had him lock his legs around the small of your back
>Tails was sandwiched in 
>his hole twitched around the invader inside him and you basked in it for the moment
>then Sonic peeked around the fox to look at you again 
>”am I going to have to get him to call you daddy again to get this ride to start again?”
>that earned him your hand drifting downwards and two fingers gripping into him like a bowling ball
>Tails was squirming against you, whimpering with your dick lodged against his prostate 
>it was awkward starting up but you made do thrusting into the fox
>he didn't seem to mind
>Sonic worked kisses along the fox's neck as their manhoods pressed against each other
>damn they'd be the death of you
>you'd lost track of when you finally climaxed into Tails
>you didn't stop slamming into him though
>you'd even nipped at his neck as you bred him deeply
>that was enough to get his gifted manhood to throb and make a mess of the two guys’ fur
>he moaned into Sonic’s shoulder as he came and you finally slowed once he relaxed
>no need to push him too hard
>Sonic wasn't as merciful though
>he grabbed Tails’ dick and started stroking them both
>he quickly milked another orgasm from the fox then himself 
>all the while Tails bucking and moaning 
>after that you pulled them onto the bed with you
>it was rather comfortable with both of them serving as a blanket
>you suggested a shower
>after that little encounter all three of you would need it
