>within the city you felt kind of shocked
>actual humans 
>Tails was very conscious of the area and had a semblance of shame
>Sonic… that was a different story
>he had no shame
>hooked onto your arm as you investigated 
>it hadn't taken long for Robotnik to make his move
>some slime creature accosting cops had to have him involved 
>then his robots came out of the woodwork
>Sonic was really the real deal when things called for it
>seeing him tear through robots and fighting that monster impressed you
>you really did have a super hero chasing after your dick
>Tails had foiled a separate ploy to blow up the city
>over the course of your city trip you did realize how out of your depth you were
>you'd become the Lois Lane here
>Sonic and Tails would never allow you in danger and they'd gotten really good at keeping you safe
>the issue was you were worried about them not being safe
>usually these isekai things ended with a guy having super powers
>but you were just… you
>hell, the city's gratitude was the only reason you could get a meal
>your money was pretty useless on another world
>let no one tell you a good deed goes unrewarded 
>but you did feel slightly guilty
>you wanted to be more than just a trophy wife here
>if those two were putting in the effort you should too
>your solution came from a source you didn't expect
>one day you were stuck in safety when you ran into a familiar pink hedgehog 
>things were… difficult 
>sure
>very awkward 
>she'd come out of the casino that Sonic and Tails had cleared out awhile before
>at first you tried pretending you were buried in your phone
>but she wasn't fooled and instantly went for your bench
>she poked your chest
>”you've got a lot of nerve.”
>she wasn't happy
>you couldn't blame her
>you wouldn't be happy to be cucked 
>to your credit Sonic was very very gay
>you brought up how you were kind of stuck here while those two went on their world saving and she sort of relented
>you apologized for how things went down 
>she did relax a little
>time seemed to heal the wounds a little
>not completely but you weren't dodging a hammer
>you patted the bench and asked her if she would hear you out a little
>you didn't expect forgiveness but you also had no idea what had gone on
>you weren't even from here
>that did at least seem to get through
>”so what do you want?”
>there was still a little edge to her voice 
>not completely hostile but she didn't exactly trust you
>fair
>you had to ask an outside party
>how could you be useful?
>you were defenseless in the face of the odds Sonic dealt with
>even she seemed more capable
>you were just a guy
>you didn't want to just be someone to be rescued, an easy target
>that gave her pause
>she sat down next to you, readjusting her skirt
>you remembered Sonic mentioning in passing he'd saved her
>but why did she need saving?
>she was plenty strong
>you didn't mention this but you knew she'd have a decent perspective 
>you felt useless here and you didn't want to feel useless
>she opened up and admitted what you knew about Sonic saving her
>the metal Sonic 
>a whole adventure 
>then he ran off
>she thought it was love at first sight
>she sighed and looked down
>you felt a little guilty 
>glancing over to her, you didn't know how to deal with this
>she thought Sonic saved her because he loved her
>but he was just being a hero
>it just came naturally to him
>that gave you an epiphany 
>Sonic would probably still be heroic even without the speed
>Amy here overcame odds
>moping about it wouldn't do anything 
>you'd just have to rise to the occasion
>you'd originally treated this adventure as an extended vacation
>yet both Sonic and Tails were saving people
>so you should shape up
>who knows, maybe you'd save them for a change 
>Amy looked crestfallen
>you apologized again for the mess that happened 
>you pointed out Sonic saved her because that's just who he is
>he'd save anyone
>no way would you bring up your relationship with him at the moment
>no need to make the wounds worse
>she'd recover and find someone
>you knew that the dating game was hard no matter where you were
>she just didn't need to give up
>and neither did you
>you told her to keep in touch and not go solo as much
>you knew you weren't her favorite person right now but Robotnik wasn't above kidnapping before
>”you should watch out too”
>she still sounded a little on edge but you hoped she'd be over it eventually 
>you weren't giving up those guys now
>rivals be damned 
>it took a little while before Sonic and Tails came back 
>you'd ended up sharing lunch with Amy and they practically froze when they saw her
>she ended up dismissing herself but thanked you for the meal
>after the initial awkwardness the two guys sat down with you
>as grateful as the city was at its new heroes, you did feel a few judgemental stares
>the hedgehog in a skimpy swimsuit with a pink tied up shirt 
>sitting in your lap didn't help
>he just hopped there like he owned it
>you knew you'd have to clean up that free hotel room you all had earned after you all had privacy
>at least people were grateful around here
>Tails fumbled around with some new technology he'd brought back while Sonic described the excursion 
>you suggested coming with the next time and Sonic lost the jovial smile to tell you absolutely not
>you wanted to help
>they were out there
>they'd fought that slime a second time
>met their friend Knuckles
>and fought a ton of robots
>you were just here
>”and you're going to stay put until Robotnik is dealt with.”
>he poked your nose for emphasis 
>it was rare to see him assertive but you were proposing getting into harm's way
>but wasn't he doing the exact same?
>he was about to bring up he had powers
>but you dismissed that
>he'd do the right thing even without them
>what you'd realized earlier was both these two were heroic even without the weirdness they had going for them
>you suggested taking this discussion upstairs to your room and Sonic agreed
>that was the quickest way to get his attention 
>being stuck cooped up in the city at least made this visit a little more special
>you knew those two would be eager for stress relief
>you could at least do that much
>the discussion about you being more help could come later with the possible help of post nut clarity helping your case
>in the bedroom Sonic instantly lost all his assertiveness
>you decided the talk could wait afterwards and picked them both up once the door shut behind you
>firm hand on each their asses, you walked over to the bed
>that poor bed had seen some use since you'd arrived in Station Square
>the whole deviant sex with these was tolerated but not exactly normal around these parts
>you noticed how people would sometimes gawk at Sonic wearing the fruitiest number possible 
>maybe it was the giant hedgehog thing
>granted, they seemed aware of these anthro people
>why they secluded themselves to one island you hadn't the faintest idea
>but the place was nice
>it didn't give a thrill to be able to pick them both up at once
>Tails wouldn't admit he liked it but he did wiggle in your palm just a little
>Sonic clung to you, even tracing a finger over your chest
>you could only lift them both for a sort burst but it was enough to show off
>you couldn't lie and say you weren't also excited to see them
>the hedgehog grabbed at your crotch and chuckled 
>”hope you missed me”
>you did
>you palmed both their asses when you sat down on the bed
>both of them arched themselves closer to you
>you hoped after a clearer head that you could reason through to them 
>you understood just where they were coming from
>but you didn't want to be useless
>you felt pretty useless
>here though, you were in control 
>you took turns kissing each guy
>they'd been so pent up on whatever quest had come their way
>no wonder they both practically begged you with their body language 
>it was hard not to want to enjoy yourself a little here
>both of them rested on one leg, Sonic in particular grinding up against it
>Tails was still shy about it but a few kisses relaxed him
>you still wanted to be more than just this to them though
>you knew you mattered
>but being useful was hard to define 
>their asses were on the line
>why shouldn't you be concerned?
>want to help?
>you'd strike at the pillow talk phase 
>right now though…
>your palm gripped Sonic's cheek and he moaned
>you'd enjoy yourselves 
>you whispered into the hedgehogs ear
>you hoped he wasn't too tired to keep up
>the taunt worked
>he bopped you in the arm
>you couldn't help it if he was a… slowpoke
>that earned you another bop
>he grinned
>you didn't want to leave Tails out and started kissing his shoulder
>that was a weak spot 
>he gripped at your shirt and leaned in
>then you were back to Sonic
>it was a challenge keeping both of them satisfied 
>but you were up to the task
>you had to say, as stressful as this new world was, this was a benefit 
>Sonic didn't go to much into foreplay this time
>he'd snatched up the bottle of lube on your nightstand and started undoing your jeans
>one thing you were happy about this city was being able to get a few changes of clothes
>Sonic and Tails didn't exactly share your pants size
>Tails climbed off your leg to let his friend yank your pants down
>you made yourself busy undoing his coveralls, surprising him
>Sonic buried himself in your exposed crotch and kissed your nuts while you undressed the fox 
>you'd probably give first dibs to the hedgehog 
>him moving up and suckling on your tip was clouding your judgment 
>his fingers were working lube into his ass 
>with Tails completely nude you pulled him close and attacked his nipple 
>one palm on his ass and the other on Sonic’s head
>you enjoyed yourself a little
>yeah this world could be great 
>despite earlier fears, they worked together well
>neither came off as jealous
>they were content to share
>and you felt relief over that
>the whole situation was nuts without a love triangle 
>they would be the death of you though
>Sonic was already a handful
>thank God Tails was far more shy
>they had ganged up on you and your world was a blur of heat and fur
>Sonic passionately kissed your cock while Tails thrust his chest up to your mouth
>cool lube replaced the hot mouth and you could tell someone was impatient 
>several pounds of ass impaled itself on your dick was one fluid motion
>your cock vanished inside him with a groan escaping his lips
>you growled into the fox's fluffy chest 
>Sonic had taken your taunt as a challenge and was riding you reverse cowgirl
>cowboy?
>well he was putting his hips into it while you practically devoured the shy fox
>Tails whimpered when you grabbed the base of his tails
>not hard enough to hurt, just enough to get his attention 
>your other hand ran over Sonic's slim chest as you held on along for the ride
>he almost instantly shot a load after hopping on your dick
>Tails was trying not to make it obvious he was grinding against you
>the whole thing was a blur but you did notice the wet stains on your shirt quickly enough
>you snatched one of Sonic’s hands and placed his lubed up fingers right near the fox's tailhole
>he didn't need to be told what to do next and soon Tails was clinging and scratching at your shirt as you got finger fucked
>your hand drifted from Sonic’s chest down to his cock and you tried pumping him with the timing of his thrusts down 
>at least the best you could without acquiring carpal tunnel 
>he arched his back and came pretty quickly with your hand coaching things along
>without warning he hopped off as easily as he hopped on and grabbed Tails by the waist and impaled his friend on your dick 
>all before bot the fox and you could react
>Tails nearly bit his tongue and you fought the urge to cum
>”I didn't want to hog it all to myself. sharing is caring isn't it?”
>he pushed Tails legs up in the air and started kissing the fox
>you had a front row seat to the debauchery and you clamped your hands on Sonic's hips
>he broke the kiss confused and looked over Tails’ shoulder
>”hey, I think you're ignoring the main attraction here”
>you pushed him against the fox and they both moaned when they frotted against each other
>that cleared things up for the hedgehog 
>you grabbed Sonic by the hips and had him lock his legs around the small of your back
>Tails was sandwiched in 
>his hole twitched around the invader inside him and you basked in it for the moment
>then Sonic peeked around the fox to look at you again 
>”am I going to have to get him to call you daddy again to get this ride to start again?”
>that earned him your hand drifting downwards and two fingers gripping into him like a bowling ball
>Tails was squirming against you, whimpering with your dick lodged against his prostate 
>it was awkward starting up but you made do thrusting into the fox
>he didn't seem to mind
>Sonic worked kisses along the fox's neck as their manhoods pressed against each other
>damn they'd be the death of you
>you'd lost track of when you finally climaxed into Tails
>you didn't stop slamming into him though
>you'd even nipped at his neck as you bred him deeply
>that was enough to get his gifted manhood to throb and make a mess of the two guys’ fur
>he moaned into Sonic’s shoulder as he came and you finally slowed once he relaxed
>no need to push him too hard
>Sonic wasn't as merciful though
>he grabbed Tails’ dick and started stroking them both
>he quickly milked another orgasm from the fox then himself 
>all the while Tails bucking and moaning 
>after that you pulled them onto the bed with you
>it was rather comfortable with both of them serving as a blanket
>you suggested a shower
>after that little encounter all three of you would need it

>the shower was really appreciated 
>Sonic and Tails weren't absolutely filthy but they had been out for a while
>your habit of washing up together would usually lead to Sonic trying to instigate nonstop marathon shower sex 
>and he did try here
>but you needed a minute to recover
>because goddamn were you spent for a little bit
>you'd toss their clothes in the washing machines downstairs
>neither seemed opposed to being nude around you in the hotel room
>you'd managed to find higher end shampoo for them both
>sure it would go to waste the second then ran out into the jungle
>but for now they be soft to the touch
>you reflected on Amy before
>you'd find a way to make yourself useful
>she did
>you hoped to chat with her some more
>maybe patch things up with her and her little hero
>you had no intention just handing Sonic off though
>the hands trying to scrub your back were hard to ignore
>well at least he was being helpful
>you made sure to get Tails’ well, tails, lathered up
>you had no idea how they kept up with their fur before you
>for some very girly fucks they sure did act like guys when it came to dirt and grime
>both were very happy when you touched behind their ears
>you'd gotten to be an expert at working with Sonic’s quills
>you hadn't jabbed yourself in ages
>after the shampoo and soap you felt refreshed and relaxed
>not enough to immediately slamfuck the hedgehog despite his fondest dreams
>you had to get their clothes cleaned up
>Sonic once more suggested Tails trade out his slightly more conservative attire for something that hugged his junk just right
>Tails, still remarkably shy despite standing fully nude in your room, denied the idea
>”oh come on, all that wagon you're dragging and you don't show it off?”
>Tails instinctively covered his ass with his now fluffy tails 
>he did not want to me your eyes
>”I do not have a ‘wagon’”
>he protested and Sonic tried to get you involved 
>he kicked up his feet on a table after making himself comfortable in an office chair
>his thumb hooked towards you 
>”I'm pretty sure he likes the wagon.”
>you had laundry to do and tried to avoid the conversation for the moment 
>you dropped the clothes into the washer, thanking the hotel staff as you made your way back up
>when you got back to the room they were still talking about asses
>well ok, Sonic was still talking about asses and Tails was asserting he had no idea who this Sir Mix-a-lot was 
>a bit of the earth culture clearly wore off on Sonic
>”think about how easy flight would be in a breezy miniskirt.”
>did Sonic normally try to pimp out his friends?
>”only the cute ones.”
>at the moment Tails was a tomato 
>they really did have sibling energy
>behind the teasing Sonic did care though
>he didn't push Tails’ buttons too hard
>that was usually your job
>Tails had taken a spot at the edge of your bed and he looked shy as ever
>”I'm not cute,” he tried to mumble out
>that put Sonic into action
>before Tails could finish the sentence, the hedgehog was next to him on the bed
>he poked the fox in the chest
>”you're cute and that's that.”
>Sonic turned to look at you
>”little help?”
>you laughed a little but you sat down next to Tails
>he was cute
>he could argue until he ran out of breath but he was cute
>you had grabbed a brush and started working on his tails, something he seemed to appreciate 
>”oh well,” Sonic shrugged, “I got you into a dress before and I'll just have to do it again”
>you thought back
>you don't recall that and brought that up
>”remember the practice kissing?”
>he said that around Tails and the fox bopped him in the arm as a sign to stop
>he rubbed his arm, feigning injury
>well that would explain things
>this time Tails spoke up
>”we've got more important things to worry about. like Robotnik”
>Sonic rolled his eyes
>”yeah yeah. definitely not my favorite subject but I get it. definitely not the guy I want to have to chase though.”
>that made you recall
>you wanted to do more and brought it up to them
>that made Sonic sigh
>you'd had this talk before 
>you prepared for the same responses 
>”it's too dangerous”
>”we can't put you in harm's way”
>”it's different”
>you had a vested interest in making sure they came home
>you pointed that out
>what if you could help
>Amy down there was kidnap bait before
>so why couldn't you be more of a help
>the mention of Amy made the hedgehog flinch a little
>still spooked by her, you guessed
>couldn't Tails just build you a gun or something?
>a grappling hook?
>some sort of explosives?
>anything 
>their reactions differed at the suggestion
>see, Amy had that hammer
>she wasn't as fast as Sonic, but she had something
>sure, it might be a crutch but it might also be a boon
>Sonic offered the same protests as before but Tails furrowed his brow
>hand on his chin, he'd started brainstorming 
>Sonic took notice
>”nope, I know that look”
>Tails saw the idea as a challenge
>”Tails, come on. he shouldn't be out there.”
>you brought up that if Robotnik was as dangerous as you'd been told, was anywhere safe?
>you could be in the back waiting to get kidnapped or hurt
>or help these two make sure the mad scientist got what was coming to him
>there was no guarantee of safety here
>you'd have a better chance with them than here alone
>Sonic was stubborn but he did see your point with that last statement
>as fast as he was he couldn't be everywhere all the time
>so why not get something going to have a fighting chance out there
>you might be able to protect them too
>the hedgehog didn't like it, he saw what you were talking about but he didn't like it
>it helped you brought up the idea of Tails building something to help you
>if it was just you talking about running out there by yourself he probably wouldn't agree
>but he trusted the fox's handiwork 
>you brought up that if Sonic didn't have his speed he'd still try to help
>sure, he had super powers
>but that wasn't the heroic part
>”you know, flattery is a pretty low blow”
>the grin he gave while saying that at least told you it was working
>you felt like you finally got through to him
>this was the closest to a victory you have had on this
>Tails was now pacing the hotel room, oblivious to his nudity 
>the shame had been forgotten while he was in “work mode”
>that reminded you
>you needed to get the laundry into the dryer
>well, Sonic’s swimsuit could airdry
>but the rest had to get into the dryer
>you asked to hit pause on the conversation and Sonic agreed
>you hoped the privacy might give them some time to go over your proposal together
>at least if you went with them you'd feel less guilty too
>using up people's goodwill like this wasn't your style
>you felt like a freeloader
>as nice as having shitty TV and air conditioning again was, you wanted to pay your own way
>after that was done you headed back up to your room
>Tails had his bare ass up in the air as he drew on a napkin on the floor
>Sonic had decided to take a catnap apparently and you quietly shut the door behind you
>you tried to ignore the ass and looked over what the inventor was doing
>from what you saw, it was pretty much a spindly exoskeleton 
>not exactly power armor
>something that could fit over your arms and legs
>he caught you looking and quietly started explaining 
>it wouldn't make you super strong or fast
>but it would enhance your abilities
>he'd work on armor next
>but this was the driving force behind it
>he could salvage all of this off enemy robots and have it built pretty quickly
>even use their weapons 
>you'd been gone for 5 minutes tops and he'd designed a bootleg Iron Man suit
>”next outing I'll have you help me scavenge what we need while Sonic pushes Robotnik around”
>he eyed the detailed little drawing and his notes 
>”if all goes well I'll have this ready in a couple weeks”
>well you didn't expect it to be overnight but you'd hoped on helping now
>this was just the compromise you'd have to live with though
>with the pace these two were going at they'd have this wrapped up before then
>but the project had merit
>and at least you could help them in the future 
>you kissed Tails on the head and thanked him for hearing you out
>”I don't think Sonic likes the idea much… but I see your point.”
>he got up and saw sleeping beauty sprawled out in all his glory on the bed and decided to slip the napkin on the nightstand
>”of course this would be easier if I had access to my shop but Robotnik takes priority right now.”
>when he bent over to place the napkin your mind went back to what Sonic said earlier
>you palmed a cheek with each hand
>he gasped
>you silently laughed
>he did have a nice ass
>it wasn't as muscled as the hedgehog's 
>sort of
>he had more thickness 
>probably with how his tails worked
>you leaned down on him
>his hands reached for the nightstand to balance himself
>your hands clamped onto his hips 
>you whispered how you'd love to see him in something short
>his protests were cut short by your clothed cock wedged in-between his cheeks 
>you were at full mast 
>he was looking over his shoulder and panting
>why shouldn't he dress girly
>didn't he want to show off for “daddy”
>you cringed a little saying that last part but it got a groan out of him
>and a laugh to your left
>Sonic was awake and apparently at half mast himself
>”well, go on~”
>well you didn't need a written invitation 
>you dropped your pants and slapped your dick on the fox's ass with an audible thwack
>Tails looked to you and then to Sonic
>you slid between his ass and rubbed your manhood over his hole
>he whimpered
>this was just like over that work table
>hopefully today wouldn't end with another plane crash
>you fucked Tail's ass, pressing his cheeks together around your cock
>Sonic looked amused and a little curious
>you hadn't done this with him 
>granted, he usually rushed into impaling himself on your dick
>”see buddy, I told you you have a nice ass.”
>Tails was blushing and Sonic decided to start jerking off while he watched 
>”also glad I was right about that daddy thing.”
>you glared at Sonic and he laughed 
>but you didn't let yourself get too distracted
>the hedgehog reached over with his free hand and pulled the fox into a slow, lazy kiss
>now Tails was getting attacked from both sides
>you ramped up your thrusting
>making sure to really put pressure against his hole
>meanwhile, Sonic kept up the kiss
>his own cock throbbing in his hand
>the next couple of minutes was a blur
>but right when you were going to cum everything shifted and Sonic was now swallowing the load that would have decorated Tails
>you were confused for about a millisecond 
>until he pulled off your cock and once more planted a deep kiss on his friend
>you knew what he was doing but seeing your cum on their tongues as they briefly broke the kisses was hot nonetheless 
>you knew Sonic was trying to get a rise from you but you were also a little spent at the moment
>he even gave a half lidded glance to you as they broke the kiss
>a faint smile on his face as a fine trail of spit connected the two furry guys
>”you're going to have to give me one of those too. glad to see you agree in Tails wearing something short though.”
>he laughed as Tails’ sense of shame returned
>he pulled the fox onto the bed laughing all the while
>”is it that meat between your legs? it is a little big for a skirt…”
>Tails could not be any more red
>he even tried covering his crotch with his tails 
>yeah, they could not be more different 
>you realized the dryer was probably done 
>despite obviously now smelling of sex, you felt it rude to leave the machine full and excused yourself for a minute
>you felt amazing
>you'd be able to help them
>post nut clarity felt pretty great too
>the laundry was thankfully done and no one really bothered you at the desk
>you sort of appreciated something close to your old life
>but you found Tails’ workshop was the most comfortable you'd been
>it sounded strange 
>but maybe you prefered Sonic and Tails’ company over people
>might have to do with the rampant uncontrolled sex
>but both were great guys in their own way
>that did make you think
>once the Robotnik thing was over
>do a date
>Sonic wasn't one for formality and structured stuff
>but like a picnic would be nice
>you really hadn't had too much of a chance to cook over here
>you got back to your room and they had the TV on
>Sonic got bored most likely
>Station Square didn't exactly have a billion channels 
>it was quick to see a news report about rampaging robots downtown
>you tossed them their clothes because you knew they'd jump
>and you insisted you were coming with
>Sonic was going to argue but decided against it
>instead he told you to keep up
>something you knew was impossible 
>the news in the lobby said the robots were fighting each other
>you pondered that while sprinting out the door
>Tails had taken flight and was almost keeping up with Sonic
>you were stuck running several blocks behind
>but you wouldn't stop
>a 15 minute jog later you finally had to take a break
>your lungs were burning for how hard you pushed yourself
>so you weren't as fast as Sonic 
>you knew that much
>but you refused to quit
>you'd push yourself 
>when you heard gunfire you hesitated but ran towards it regardless
>it was a cluster fuck by the time you arrived
>sure enough, there was a robot fighting other robots
>Sonic and Tails had seen this and decided to take care of the horde first 
>the one robot had a machine gun and kept magdumping into what looked like it's clone
>by now civilians were out of the crossfire 
>the robots’ attention was split between 3 targets now
>you picked up a piece of debris, a piece of rebar from a shattered barricade 
>you saw one aiming it's guns at Tails in the air and smashed the thing as hard as you could
>pain shot through your arms as the vibration was immediate and terrible
>smashing metal on metal with ni gloves hurt like a bitch 
>but the robot's little processor was kaput
>the robots’ attention was now divided between 4 targets 
>you ducked behind a building when a bunch of muzzles pointed at you
>one of the others used the distraction and took out another
>metal smashed and you heard a distinctly feminine shout as more metal was splintered
>with Amy here there were 5 targets to divide the robots’ attention
>you peaked out of cover and saw the two clones shooting at each other, solely focused on the other's elimination 
>meanwhile the other 3 were giving the enemy serious problems
>the horde started focusing completely on the 3 fleshy targets and not the rebellious machine
>you scored another lucky hit on another distracted robot
>sucker punches didn't seem fair but they had guns
>you just had a piece of steel that hurt your hands every time you slammed it down
>those rare machines that turned to track you were instantly in turn wiped out by Sonic
>he was watching over you even while you tried to help
>you sort of felt guilty but still contributed best you could
>minutes passed and tmin the commotion the orange underdog robot had won its gunfight 
>Sonic went to finish it off before Amy stopped them before they came to blows
>said the machine was friendly
>not the oddest thing you'd heard of 
>Tails busied himself cataloging the wreckage and you went along with him gathering parts 
>the blue hedgehog didn't like letting one of Robotnik's machines go but he dropped the issue
>the situation was a little awkward but you were too busy helping Tails take apart machinery to read the room much
>Amy gave the machine a chance to leave and it took it
>you could tell Sonic was tense from a glance
>but he allowed it
>you were sort of relieved given it felt ghoulish dismantling robots in front of one
>Amy still sort of put the fear of God into the blue hedgehog but he tried not to show it
>your earlier talk had mellowed her out a little
>didn't even brandish her hammer
>the conversation between them was still tense despite this
>her feelings for him wouldn't just vanish over the course of one conversation
>that would be too easy a fix
>but the anger was gone
>Sonic was less blunt this time around
>he'd already stated the facts up on that pyramid an he wasn't one to make someone actually suffer
>teasing was one thing
>the two attempted to share information on Robotnik
>they had a common goal there
>apparently Amy had been saved before by that robot
>whatever it was it was making a beeline for other command units 
>so why not let it do its thing?
>Sonic rested his hands on his hips
>he could see the logic in that
>but it always could be a trick by Robotnik 
>gain your trust
>then attack when your guard is down
>he would do something that underhanded
>Sonic warned Amy to be careful before turning to Tails and you arm deep in some robot
>you had no idea what Tails was cataloging but maybe this would speed up his project
>fighting these things with a length of rebar sucked
>Amy was about to leave but you made sure to tell her to stay safe out there
>she did the same
>maybe there was a chance she'd move on after all
>after that excitement Sonic came over
>Tails was busy cataloging parts
>the cops were playing clean up
>once more Sonic had saved the city but some people had noticed he'd let one of the machines go
>you knew how fickle people could be
>you took Sonic aside and pointed out it probably wasn't smart to stay here any more
>eventually the hospitality would run dry
>best case scenario you get a bill
>worst case pitchforks and torches
>Tails did remark over your conversation a lot of this could be used to patch up the Tornado 
>that would be perfect
>you'd have the thing patched up and back to the shop in no time
>then deal with Robotnik's next move
>Sonic agreed with the idea and with the idea of getting out of dodge
>rumors would start spreading
>so best to leave
>he wasn't one to stay in one place too long either
>with the surface to air gun silenced you could leave in peace
>you'd head back to the hotel and get what was left of your belongings and clean the place up
>then meet them at the Tornado
>Sonic would circle back if you got lost
>the grabbed the parts they needed and you split up
>the hotel was pretty dead
>you slipped in, cleaned up and got out quietly
>for what it was worth you left a thank you note on the nightstand for whatever poor maid had to clean up 
>it sucked giving up the armor idea for the time being but getting the Tornado running was a better investment right now
>Sonic could probably run across the ocean again but he wasn't about to abandon you two
>as nice as being around your own kind was, you were happier with those boys
>at least at the workshop you could publicly pound them
>you made your way into the jungle and Sonic had met you halfway into the brush
>”Tails is busy with the plane.”
>there was a hint in his voice
>you knew what kind of hint
>you wouldn't have to wait for the workshop to publicly pound one of your boyfriends
>you leaned back against a tree and let him start undoing your pants
>he went to kneel and you knew what was coming next
>all the excitement earlier must have made him pent up
>you felt a little guilty leaving Tails to work on the plane
>but Sonic had to work on something else that smacked him on the face
>the smile on his face almost reminded you on a like a drunk
>he looked up to you and kissed the shaft a couple times
>you placed your hand on his head and basked in the feeling
>you didn't know how people got bored with a partner
>every time he kissed your cock and looked up at you with those green eyes it was like that first time again
>you had lost count just how much you'd fucked either of these guys
>you wondered if they remembered
>not that you could ask Sonic right now
>you had his mouth busy
>when your cock twitched he giggled 
>he knew he did that and even pressed face first to your cock he had a proud glint in his eyes
>amazingly he was taking his time
>Sonic was not one to pace himself
>so you decided, why not spice things up a little?
>you told him to slip out of his swimsuit bottom and he quickly complied
>maybe he had an idea of what you planned
>maybe he just wanted to obey
>you picked him up easily, he was a manlet
>flipping him upside down was harder but you managed 
>he wasn't confused and instantly worked with you
>you sat down in the brush as you now were both face to crotch with each other
>you'd never done this for him but why not test the waters a little?
>his legs rested on your shoulders and your hand went back to his head
>getting shoved back into your crotch had him leaking precum
>when you gave the tip of his cock a peck he moaned and arched his back 
>with his mouth open you shoved it down on your cock
>your other hand gripped at his firm asscheek for stability
>you weren't normally one for blowjobs but you'd known Sonic long enough by now 
>him and Tails were about the only time you'd ever think to do this
>but you wanted to assert yourself a little too
>you were sure neither minded 
>to both their credit, neither brought it up before
>you had him throating your dick and you'd kiss along his
>like clockwork, he had that hammer trigger and came within a minute
>no warning either
>just a whorish moan around your dick and his whole body tensed
>you had a feeling you were going to drain him in one sitting 
>eventually you worked up to fucking his throat, holding his head in place
>he was experienced in taking your cock by now
>you made a note that he'd look good with running mascara right about now
>you'd have to suggest that
>his cock was easy to deal with
>with his trigger he came from the littlest attention
>allowed you devote more energy to his mouth
>no one could say you were selfish though
>when you sucked the cock down to the base he came down your throat 
>the feeling was weird
>but for these two you'd do it
>you wondered how he'd react to you snowballing him
>his next couple were surprises and your shirt was going to positively reek of him until you could wash it
>six rapid fire hedgehog orgasms later he was actually tuckered out
>his last climax was a dry one, his balls all tapped out for the moment
>he'd accepted his throat’s new role as a fleshlight in stride
>he would occasionally have to fight and pull back to get oxygen into his lungs but you'd shove his face back onto your cock after the breaks
>you grabbed his other asscheek and just face fucked him with the full force of your hips
>yeah he'd need runny mascara
>his cock once more throbbed to life and you started suckling on it again as you felt your orgasm welling up faster as faster
>he knew you were close and grabbed around your legs
>he was choosing your cock over oxygen
>preferring choking on your dick
>both of you tried to make sure you came together
>you actually stood up easily now, sucking at his sore dick as you bulged out his throat with every angry thrust 
>he came before you again but with one feral growl you poured thick ropes up into his eager mouth 
>you nearly fell back over, accidently pile driving Sonic into the jungle floor, but your legs held
>both of you broke away to catch your breath
>all the while you held him upside down
>after a few ragged breaths you kissed his inner thigh and he roughly laughed
>it took him a little while to recuperate but he spoke up
>for some reason his voice was a little hoarse 
>”well if you weren't gay for that ‘I love you’ stuff, you are now”
>you stuffed his face in your crotch and he let out a muffled laugh
