As Gigan busied itself with writing his essay. Inigo sat, elbow propped on his desk, chin on hand. His gaze fell three desks away from him at the figure of Hoge with her face buried in one of their textbooks. He sighed. She was only getting cuter and cuter every day. What made things even worse, was that she was so vehement that they respected school rules while in Shiketsu. They were official now, and he had been over the moon, but - he could count the number of times he’d been able to spend time with her on one hand since summer break. Texting was nice but he had to get closer. He glanced over to Hifumi and Hailey talking by the window, with an arm wrapped around each other’s waist. 

*They don't have this issue.* 

He stared enviously at Imai and Ashleigh who sat next to each other. What he wouldn't give for a change in seating plans. Even Bobby, who was mysteriously gone all the time, wasn't having any problems. He looked at his bro’s empty seat, then glanced over at Minnie’s empty seat.   

*Where are they off to now?* 

He shook his head. He needed to calm down. His mission relied on it because today was the day he broke that barrier. He grabbed a paper folder from his bag and stood up to walk over to Hoge's desk. Unlike many of his other class-wide ideas, the class quickly accepted his plan to throw a surprise lunch party for Rosethorn-senpai, who was away due to injuries. But as much as Inigo cared for his homeroom teacher, none of that was his focus today, because it was a reason to talk to Hoge face-to-face.

*I’ll prove that I can be a professional and reliable boyfriend.*

“Ehem.. Yo! Class Rep, dropping in with my plans for the party. I got about a million ideas I wanna run by. You have a minute?” he said with a confident grin and a wink, opening the paper folder slightly. A crude drawing of piñatas resembling The Five can be seen on top.

Almost mechanically, Hoge glanced up at him, nodded, adjusted her glasses and neatly put away her notebook. 

“Okay. I have time now, Myoga-san,” she said, tilting her head slightly and giving him a polite smile.

His heart skipped a beat as she looked at him. He had to remind himself that she wouldn't use his first name in a classroom setting. There were too many people around. 

"Sweet! Tell me which ones you like! Keep in mind that I know a guy who sells cheap trampolines." He leaned forward while standing in front of her desk. He began running through his ideas with her as she picked through the somewhat messy stack of paper.

*It’s working. If I play my cards right, she might ask for more time to discuss things after class. We’ll spend time outside and inside the school! Take that, no relationship rule!*

"I like this one. It's within our budget and it’s the least disruptive one. The streamers are very imaginative," she said looking up at him.

“Cool, the balloons represent the people she fought together with. This large one is Seiryu.”

“And the lumpy one?”

“Oho- That’s Majestic-senpai.” He pantomimed the #6 hero and she giggled.

 “Should we go with this one then?”

“Yeah! It could work but-” He adjusted his folder and saw one of his pencils under the stack, it rolled off the desk and fell to the floor on her left. Their eyes met for a moment and then they both looked down at the pencil.

*Crap. It was going so well too. No biggie. I’ll just reach down and pick it up.*

He started to move his hand down. 

*But wait- what if she picked it up at the same time as I do. It’s closer to her after all. She’s in a sitting position. Then our hands would meet and I don't think I can resist taking her hand. Then, would she expect me to do something? I'm sure of it. Something like this happened in Crimson Whispers: Veil of Secrets and it led to an H-scene! People would definitely see that! Someone would say something.*

He glanced around at Hiro and Orochi, and then at all the Korean girls nearby. It's too dangerous.

*She’d take it as a sign that we need to be more careful, which means even less time together. I definitely can’t pick it up. So I’ll wait for her to get it.*

Hoge glanced at the clock above the board. Ten minutes before the next period starts. Then Inigo would have to leave. She couldn’t ask him to stay, right? He was staring at the pencil that fell on the floor. He was being weird. She moved to pick up the pencil and then stopped.

*He’s waiting for me to pick it up, so he could reach down and pick it up too. He’ll take my hand and say one of his lines. He’s trying to fluster me, and it’d be in front of everyone! How horrible. It’s the lunch room all over again. Ini, you were doing so well. I won't play this game.*

She can’t pick it up now. She decided to wait it out.

Inigo chuckled. “Woops, dropped my pencil.”

*Crap! What was that? It’s been three minutes since that happened! We’ve just been here staring at it. That was definitely not a normal response! Why isn’t she getting it? She hasn't said anything. Unless.. She has doubts about me. A gentleman would of course pick it up first. Can’t have a lady bending down. But! She’s always going on about letting her do things on her own. This is a test of whether or not I buckle.*

He stared into her deep brown eyes and gulped. A bead of sweat rolling down his forehead as he gave her a reassuring smile.

Hoge felt a little dizzy. Glancing at the pencil and Inigo's proximity made her anxious. They had stopped talking for three minutes. Was there a social convention that she was forgetting? Thinking about it only made her more tense which caused her quirk to act up. She took a deep breath and tugged at her shirt to ease herself. It was getting hot in the classroom. 

“Ooh. Yes, that’s okay,” she replied.

*I should just pick it up. Ini’s clearly waiting for me. Did he call my bluff? He's standing there with a smirk on his face like he knows something. Does he think I’m weird for not picking it up when I’m closer? It’s awful. Why are you being cruel? At this point, whoever picks it up would have to acknowledge the awkwardness of the situation. I only know one thing for certain–*

*-- I definitely cannot be the one to pick up that pencil!* 

Inigo locked eyes with her again. 

*I know! I’ll get Gigan to swoop in and grab it. C’mon buddy. Do this one for me.* 

Gigan simply snickered at Inigo’s desk. 

*That little jerk is punishing me for not doing my essay! Crap. It’s been seven minutes… At this point, I might as well pick it up to show this doesn't bother me. It’s the only way to salvage this. To be a better man and rise above the situation. I can’t have her thinking I’m a weirdo all day.*

He moved to pick up the pencil. His hand seemed like it was moving in slow motion. Another bead of sweat rolled down his face.

*I have to get it first before Ini. Logically speaking it was up to me to get it. I can be doing other things right now. And if I'm unable to - he might not come by again if I don’t. Why did I wait? It was dumb to wait. Is he reaching for it too?? Now of all time? I have to beat him to it.*

Hoge reached out to grab the pencil, her breath catching in her throat. 

*Whoever picks it up first--*
***
***
 *--can simply say they were waiting for the other, thus claim victory.* 
***
***
*The idle person would have no choice except to be the strange one!*

Chris frowned and picked up the pencil off the floor. He almost stepped on it on his way back to his desk.

“This, yours?” He said to Hoge who was sitting there with her face flushed.

Hoge shook her head and pointed to Inigo.

“Here you go, man.” He held it out to Inigo who seemed flustered.

“Nah, I don’t need it!”

“What?”

“Just take it and go, bro!” Inigo muttered.

“Cain-san, take the pencil and leave,” Hoge stammered.

“Fine.” Chris sighed and marched to his desk as Kitamura-sensei walked in for their Physics lesson. 

(Alright, take your seats everyone!)

*They're acting odd again.. Why do I feel a cold chill all of a sudden?* 

He looked around at Inigo and Hoge shooting him daggers from their desks. They're always so odd..

Inigo frowned. He didn't expect Chris to swoop in like that. Still, Hoge had held out and he felt like he failed. She was very clever. Their eyes met across the classroom, sparks of longing and determination flying between them. This battle was far from over.
