My heart feels at home with you.

Mio exited her room after a long collab stream and collapsed at your side. After a long sigh, she got under the covers and cooed up to you, you wrapped your arms around her and gave her forehead a soft kiss. 

“It was a very fun stream” 

“Hmm”

Mio wasn’t answering. She was snuggling you with her arms and her tail, resting her head on your bicep, you turned over so she would rest on top of you and turned off your nightlight. In the middle of our dark room, you could feel her soft breaths on your neck. Giving her soft kisses on her forehead, you ran your fingers through her hair and caressed her back. She leaned in to give you a kiss which you received gratefully, before burying her face in your chest and drifting off to sleep.

And you did the same.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You were getting ready to leave for work while Mio watched from the bed, laying on her side. You put on your suit and tie and turned around.

“So, how do I look?” You asked Mio.

Without saying a word, she got up from bed and took off your tie, undid the knot and made it again. It came out a lot more neat and elegant. She smirked at you, teasing you about not being able to tie your own ties by this point. 

“What would you like for breakfast?” Mio asked.

“I don’t have time, I’ll be late”

Your answer disappointed Mio, but she didn’t protest. As you hurried for the door and Mio followed you. She fixed your suit one last time and looked at you expectantly, before grabbing your tie and aggressively pulling you in for a kiss.

Almost instinctively, you wrapped your arms around Mio, and your hand slowly reaches down until it squeezes one of her buttocks. Mio jumps at the sudden gesture, but all she does is hug you hard, scratching your back under your suit. The kiss becomes a lot more intimate, as you two play with each other’s tongues, with short kisses in between breaths and lip biting. Your hand kept squeezing Mio’s behind, and almost ran under her underwear, but you had to leave, and you couldn’t spare any more minutes.

As you pulled away from Mio, a string of saliva connected both of your mouths, and Mio looked at you, needy, lustful, but sad, knowing you had to leave soon.

The day went by without anything of notice. After coming home in a crowded train and dropping yourself in the sofa, Mio sat next to you and tapped her tights with both hands. You buried your face in them and sighed.

Now Mio was pampering your tired self, caressing you, humming a song.

During your little rest in her lap, feeling her fingers across your cheeks and hair, you heard her say something that shook you.

“Say Anon, how would you feel about being a househusband?”

You perked up to Mio’s smile, who was serious about the offer.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“So, the first thing you must know about baking a proper cake, is the consistency of the batter” 

Mio was giving you a crash course on how to make a simple dry cake. You copied everything she did, but after putting both molds in the oven and taking them out, yours came out soggy.

Mio laughed at you playfully, mocking you before lifting her own mold, but once she did, nothing was under. Her cake was stuck to the mold. Her face became red with shame as she realized she forgot to butter the mold, before turning to you, who were already containing your own laughter.

“T-This happens sometimes, you just forget!” Said Mio.

By this point you couldn’t hold your laughter in and Mio pouted, before laughing herself. You both ate the unburnt parts of her cake with some tea. 

…

Once she fell into a deep sleep, you sneaked out into the kitchen and turned on the light.

Trying to remember how the recipe went, you muttered to yourself the same steps Mio taught you, making as little noise as possible.

“4 eggs, whisk, add some flour, whisk again…”

As Mio rubbed the sleep off her eyes in the morning, she turned over to your side to wake you up, but all she saw was an empty spot next to her. Then, she heard something in the kitchen.

Mio got up in her pajamas and went to investigate, until she saw you, making coffee and cutting a piece of cake on a plate.

Mio took a seat as you served her and anxiously awaited for her to taste the cake you tried to replicate multiple times during the night. She squeezed it in her hand and took a confident bite. Her eyebrows raised in surprise before turning to you.

Mio smiled sweetly.

“It’s almost as sweet as you!”

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You kept rubbing your back with the piece of toilet paper and rubbing alcohol. It hurt like hell, but you had to put with it. The more you moved your hand the more scratches you could find just by the burning sensation of the alcohol..

Over in the bedroom Mio was still coming to her senses when she saw the bathroom light on. Getting up, she went in to see and gasped in horror upon seeing you. She took the piece of toilet paper from you and started rubbing you herself while saying “Sorry” repeatedly.

You clenched your teeth through the pain a bit before turning your back to the mirror. All over you, there were scratches, from across your scapula all the way to your lower back, and the crown to all of this, a bite mark in your shoulder. Mio hugged you from the front, still repeating the word sorry over and over. 

Mio felt embarrassed and guilty, before feeling something between her legs.

“A-Anon! Why are yo- Look at you-!”

You shunned Mios complaints with a kiss, placing both of your hands on her shoulders, slowly embracing her. Mio, still in the heat of the previous moment, couldn’t resist her own passions. You picked Mio in your arms and bridal carried her over to bed, while she giggled the whole time.

Once the morning came, Mio was getting ready to go to a dance practice and left early, not without giving your half-asleep self a gentle kiss on the cheek. You started to finally get up once you heard the door close, slowly gathering yourself from last night. You got in the bathroom and washed your face awake, then remembered something. You turned your back to the mirror once more. It was even more messed up than before. 

You flexed your back muscles, pridefully looking at your love scars.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mio walked all over the room completely excited, repeatedly looking back to check that what she saw was real.

She was brainstorming ideas on how to tell you the great news, but her time was cut short when she heard the front door.

“I’m back!” You yelled at you let the groceries on top of the kitchen table.

Mio hurried over and opened her mouth, but nothing came out of it.

You stared at your beautiful dork of a wife while putting the vegetables on the fridge. She stood there with a knot in her throat. 

Mio was extremely eager to say something to you, but she was also just as nervous.

“So, how was your last stream?” You asked trying to get her going, you know she needs a little push when this happens. And well, you too wanted to know the news, maybe she hit a new milestone on her channel, or just had to tell you about something that happened. Mio helped you unpack the grocery bags and putting everything where it had to be, fruit, meat, veggies, baking supplies and more.

Her silence was strange, by now she should’ve spilled the beans to you.

After you were both done, Mio started to tug at your arm without saying a word, slowly leading you into the bedroom.

“Sit” Mio said.

You sat on the bed.

“Close your eyes!”

Playing along, Mio told you to stick your hands out and she put something in them, as you cusped it. Long, plastic..

“Okay! Now open!”

You looked at your hands and your heart immediately jumped.

Two stripes.
