"You know, if one of us dies the other gets to keep the entire paycheck."

Rika glanced over at the red-furred cat, the muscles around her left eye starting to twitch as she sneered.

"That's stupid."

"Just saying. Can't trust ya."

"You think I'm going to stab you in the back?"

"Well you do have the big fuckin' sword."

"Tell me straight-edge, do you think this is funny?"

"No. It's fuckin' hilarious." Roxie, her "partner" for this job, grinned back at the tiger-wolf, stretching with her arms behind her head.

The two of them had been hired by some random schmuck with a lot of rings (probably a proxy for Eggman or GUN or something) to go check out one of the many bases that had been taken over by Eggma'am. Apparently they hadn't properly blown up every last bit of scrap metal from the last mess Eggman caused, and now his female alter ego was taking over the ruins and retrofitting them. It had been less than a week, and already entire bases bore the altered logo and were actively producing the engines of war. The two mercenaries were perched atop a rocky ledge overlooking the Desert Pyramid, a known launch pad for "space junk" and weapons factory. The job was simple: blow it up while Eggma'am was looking the other way. A place packed full of weapons and robots should be easy to destroy if there's enough explosives, right?

Well, that was the idea. Simple didn't mean easy, which was why Rika was hesitant about this job. But fifty thousand rings was fifty thousand rings. That was AFTER splitting the bill. If she'd had better options, she'd be taking them instead. As it was... things were a mess and she needed money to keep herself alive. That meant going into the lioness' den, and hopefully not waking the beast.

"You sitting around all day or are we going to be drinking our asses off and fucking them back on by midnight?"

"I'm watching." The swordswolf grit her teeth.

"You can't see shit from here!"

"Only because you're not bothering to look."

"Oh tell me wise bitch, what is it you can seeeeeeee then? Hmmm?"

"I can see that there's not a single robot stationed outside, even though there's dropships flying in and out." She pointed to one that was on approach. "Which means external security is handled by something other than pawns. Maybe turrets hidden in portholes."

"Pssshh, that just means we stomp them back into their shells. Let's go." Roxie waited no longer, leaping from the edge of the cliff with a whoop and catching herself with brass spikes that slammed into the stone, leaving two deep grooves halfway down.

"Wait!- Ugh." There went Rika's plan to hitch a ride on a dropship. She made sure her sword was secured to her back and took a slightly safer route down, hopping from ledge to ledge and avoiding the largest drops. Roxie had her beat by nearly a quarter mile by the time she got down. That put her halfway to the base of the pyramid, with no defenses in sight despite the way she was skylining herself. Until it got them into trouble she'd be grateful for Roxie taking that direct of a path, it meant she had a way to catch up by rushing in the valleys of the dunes. Sand kicked under her as she took a loping stride, pausing on occasion to look for traps. Eggman loved traps, so why wouldn't Eggma'am?

When the yawning pit of steel opened up and swallowed half a dune along with a red cat, Rika knew her paranoia had been justified. Unfortuantely, now she had to deliberately jump down the same hole or else lose track of her partner completely. There was no way she could do this one alone. Lacking any alternative means, she went for the reckless route, skidding straight off the sand into the yawning metal maw.

Frankly, she expected to break her ankles on this. It was a pleasant shock to discover the pillow of sand that dampened her fall and let her roll to bleed off the energy. Roxie was already looking around the bottom of the tube, with no apparent exits in sight.

"Oh hey, thanks for dropping in!" She waved cheerily at Rika.

"...Do you realize we're the closest it comes to fish in a barrel right now?"

"Well yeah, but check this out!" She tapped part of the wall, producing a dull note as her brass knuckles rang against the steel. "Hollow. I bet there's a door here, different from the rest of this stuff."

And then, as naturally as breathing, she drew back and threw a punch that dented steel.

"Oh. Okay then." Rika threw up her hands, sword and all. Sure, she'd cut metal plenty of times before, but she had the leverage of a sword! And robots weren't nearly as tough as blast doors! You'd have to be someone like Knuckles to pull that move off!

Maybe there was a reason Roxie was still kicking after all. Well, aside from dumb luck.

"Check it, GET FUCKED!" She threw another punch, and there was a visible hole leading into darkness afterwards. "UP YOURS!" Another blow, and the hole widened. "AND NOW WE'RE GONNA SPREAD THOSE CHEEKS!"

It was big enough to put both her hands into, and against all of what Rika understood, she was ripping that opening into something she could squeeze through! Muscles rippled beneath the jacket, and Roxie occasionally shifted to get some sand out from under her feet, but otherwise it seemed easy for her! Metal groaned and sheared around her gauntlets until it had been sufficiently widened on one axis. Then she started peeling the excess metal way to round out the hole.

At that point, the robots dropped into the pit. They came out of pods in the walls, while a grid of lasers sealed off the top of the hole. Net launchers or some other large-bore gun popped out at around the same time.

"Huh. That was slow! Neat. Come on, I'll push you through before the chucklefucks roast your ass."

At this point Rika didn't have much choice. She bolted for the opening, putting her sword out in front and diving. She didn't quite clear it, metal catching on the pockets of her pants, which required Roxie to grab at her thighs, pull her back slightly, and then shove through. The extra ass-squeeze was for her own amusement, Rika was sure.

On the other side was a long hallway and pitch darkness.

The cat and the wolf walked through it together.

***

The hallway was long, with a rail track set into the floor and occasional intersections that seemed to lead towards more of the pits. It wouldn't have shocked Rika to learn that this was a missile deployment system doubling as a trap for intruders. Fortunately, they didn't anticipate someone busting through the wall, though with the cameras on the intersections it was clear they could come under assault at any time. Behind them, the robots that had tried to trap them were left confused, apparently unable to go through the hole or widen it like Roxie had. There had been a few potshots, at first, but they were far out of range now.

They walked, rather than run. It gave Rika time to come to terms with the situation, saved energy, and Roxie was using the chance to chat.

"So what the fuck's up with you?"

Rika glanced over at the other woman, the sword in her hand almost scraping the ground as she held it in a reverse grip. She didn't want to put it away properly when they could be ambushed at any time, after all.

"You're gonna need a better question."

"You know, like, why are you?"

"Why am I..."

"You. What's up with you? Who the fuck are ya?"

"You're not making much sense."

"I make all of the senses." She waggled her eyebrows like that was supposed to be a joke, but it flew far over Rika's head. "For real though, what's your story?"

Finally. A question she actually understood! She just didn't want to answer it.

"None of your business."

"If you can't even answer that, what's stoppin ya from stabbing me?"

"Besides the fact that you can break my sword like a toothpick? We're mercenaries, you don't want to hear my shitty sob story and I don't wanna hear yours."

"Nah mine isn't a sob story. C'mon, I'm bored, this hallway is long as fuck and nothing's trying to kill us!"

"Fine. I'm an orphan and I do this for cash. There. Happy?"

"That's fuckin nothing!"

"Exactly. Less talking about dumb things and more focusing on the fact that we're in Eggma'am's base and need to find a way to bring it down."

"Oh so you mean like that light at the end of the tunnel?"

"What light-" Rika swore. "That's not the end of the tunnel that's a TRAIN!"

"SWEET! Think I can stop it?"

"IT'S A TRAIN-"

It was not a train. As it got close enough that the headlight reflecting off the walls revealed it's form, that became obvious enough. It was a giant robot running on the tracks, four arms coming off it's central body with wheeled fingers that sparked on the edges of the tunnel. There was a glass dome, but the pilot wasn't visible inside. It might even be empty, piloted remotely.

"GIANT ROBOT! LET'S KICK IT'S ASS!"

"No, we-" Couldn't run because it was faster than them, couldn't hide because it was a tunnel and the last intersection had been a while ago... "-need to be smarter about how we fight it than just "kick it's ass", we have to find a way up to that cockpit!"

It didn't stop or slow down as it approached, instead it swept it's arms down in a high-walled formation that would splatter them like bugs against the steel. Rika was about ready to embrace death and be known as an idiot forever, but Roxie once again proved there was more to her than met the eye, grabbing her partner up under one arm. As Rika yelped, they were launched upwards in a single jump, so hard and fast that they almost stuck the ceiling for an instant.

The robot passed them.

It stopped, the squeal of metal grinding as it pulled the breaks on the tracks.

It turned around, somehow rotating it's entire body, a 180 that had it facing the duo again as Roxie deposited them on the ground.

It started to throw punches.

Roxie PARRIED one of the giant fists, throwing herself ahead of Rika and launching an uppercut that sent the hand flying upwards and overhead.

"THAT'S HOW WE DO IT!"

"Wha- what are you!?"

"I'M A BEAST!"

The other three arms came in, and Rika moved. Panic lent her speed and practice gave her grace. She jumped without thinking, avoiding a fist that scraped against the ground and landing atop the arm. Sword held out behind her to maintain balance, she ran right up that arm towards the glass "skull" of the machine. A single whip-armed strike sent cracks through it, but there was a shockwave defense of some sort - a blast of hot wind sent her flying backwards after she landed the blow.

"HELL YEAH!" Roxie cheered her on as she flipped and skid along the ground. Her boots were going to need replaced after the abuse they'd been through this week. The landing was rough, but she knew how to roll with the fall and only came up with a few scrapes, nothing serious.

More hot wind started hissing from the thing's arms, pneumatic systems going into overdrive as the eyes within the logo on it's chest - the headlights, Rika now realized - flickered from blue to red. It was angry now!?

With a clap it sent a massive shockwave, visible in the red light as a ripple in the air, straight towards them. Roxie didn't try to punch this one back, instead joining Rika in diving out of the way. When they came up again, a massive hand was trying to swat them down, but Roxie went into a twirling, jumping uppercut that cancelled it's momentum. Sensing opportunity, Rika ran to the nearby wall, and then took three steps up it before kicking off, twisting to land on the stabilized hand and making for round two of the long run. This time, the jets of hot wind had an obvious source, hissing power launching up from holes along the forearm that she danced around on her way to the cockpit. Another swipe with her sword - still in reverse grip because she hadn't had time to even think about correcting it - widened the cracks. She could see that there was somebody inside it now, but it was a robot, a Pawn. One of the ones with two eyes instead of a single visor, but the same angry red instead of brilliant blue hue. It turned and glared at her as it slammed a red button that opened ports on the shoulders, forcing her off with more pneumatic power.

"ONE MORE TIME!" Rika shouted as she landed. "I think I can take out the guy in the cockpit!"

"Forget waiting then!" Roxie made a "come here" motion with her arm. "Jump!"

No time to think, Rika recovered from her tumble and went straight into her fellow bounty hunter's arms. Or rather, she jumped on top of them, and Roxie used herself as a springboard to send the swordwolf flying straight back to the cockpit. In the instant she had to move before impact, she crossed her arms behind her blade, pointing herself like a giant spear. With a crash of glass, she slammed right through the cockpit's dome and skewered the robot inside to his seat. The mech-suit went completely still, and then automatically powered down.

"Well ain't that a bitch and a half." Rika hissed, taking a wild guess as to what had happened. "I just broke the keys to this car."

And unless they tore it down, another robot could come in and get it running again to come after them.

For now, though, there wasn't much that could be done. They had to get moving before something else happened.

"Let's go!" Rika shouted, balancing as she bolted down the lowered arms of the thing at unsteady speed and hit the ground running. "That probably got everything's attention!"

"Hell yeah! More shit to smash!"

This was going to be a long day.

***

"I wonder if she's got sex dungeons down here."

"Ain't enough time in the day for questions like that."

"But like really, she's hot as hell, she's gotta have sex dungeons."

"How do those thoughts even connect? Are you chipped in the head?"

"What's that mean!?"

Rika dove after her powerhouse partner without answering, the duo falling through the grate of an air duct that Roxie had stomped out with one firm kick. They landed with powerful slams on a giant gear set with several others, the internals of a machine as big as the entire pyramid, no doubt. Why there was so much space inside this section was a mystery, but Rika wasn't going to complain about having the room to move around. Compared to the vent-crawl they'd done after reaching a locked door at the end of the tunnel, this was roomy. The robots teleporting in were an excuse to stretch her limbs out and pop some joints - her own and the machines, in different ways.

Roxie was already embroiled in the battle, hurtling some of the grounded pawnbots from the slowly rotating gears towards their flying brethren. Rika focused on staying unharmed, slashing the energy bolts from the air as she side-stepped them for extra safety. Her march towards the offending blaster-bots was slow and inevitable, the swordswolf self-assured in her ability to fight as long as someone was covering her rear. Metal was rent by sword and fist, and the duo marched onwards into the bowels of the factory. Access doors were easy for Roxie to punch through, and Rika made a habit of slicing down security cameras on sight.

There was just one problem.

"Why are we going down? How far down does this place even go!?" Roxie asked, and Rika pulled up short at a spiral staircase. It went both up and down, offering an actual choice of direction.

"I dunno."

"Do either of us know what we're doin?"

"Blowing this place up."

"...Uh, how?"

"There's the thrust of it." Rika nodded, emphasizing by actually thrusting her blade in Roxie's direction. "I'm looking for the stockpile of shit that goes boom. I figure that's gonna be at the bottom. If it's not, we keep looking."

"Oh. Huh." The red-furred cat wound back an arm, rolling her shoulder. "I wanted to find the computer room."

"What would that do for us?"

"I dunno, smash it up, everything shuts down, right?"

"That doesn't permanently destroy anything, though."

"Yeah, well, it turns everything off."

"Does it?!"

"I dunno! I just hear that Eggman computer rooms control everything!"

"I say we go down and set off the powder keg."

"That's gonna blow us up too!"

"No it won't."

Roxie scoffed at that. "You're just tryin to get me killed."

"What the fu- you're the one trying to get us killed by wasting time on something that won't finish the job!"

"If we break the computers, everything shuts down!"

"If we blow up the ammo, everything shuts down AND it can't be fixed!"

"I'm gonna smash the computer room!"

"I'm going to blow this place to kingdom come!"

"Fine!"

"Fine!"

The two of them split up without another word, leaving Rika alone as she descended once more, and Roxie rose above. The tiger-wolf suppressed her irritation, knowing that it would have been just as easy for her to follow after Roxie as it was for Roxie to follow her. They'd split up for no real reason and she was just as much as at-fault. Unfortunately, Roxie was far faster than Rika by virtue of being more brazen and powerful enough to punch through doors. She wouldn't be able to catch up with the cat now.

The robots that flashed into existence on the staircase earned their scrapping at the edge of a blade or the kick of a boot that sent them plummeting into the black abyss below. Rika wanted to hug the inside wall, but there were no rails and a large gap between the edge of the stairs and the glass tube running down the middle. Instead, she stayed towards the middle of the path, fighting her way down the spiral.

The violence was a way to exert her feelings into the world, so long as she didn't lose herself by focusing too hard on what was going on in her mind. Her body sang with strength as she pierced metal shells and sliced off limbs, the burn of exercise making every part of her warm and almost numbed. This was the most robots she'd ever contested at a time, and she flowed through them like a dark river of flashing steel. Cut and stab and stab and cut and hurtle a body into the empty air so that it catches a shot meant for her. On and on and down and down, further from her partner on the job.

It took far too long to reach the bottom, the sub-finite basement as she was calling it inside her thoughts. So long as she kept moving, the burn wouldn't fade and leave her empty and aching. That meant she had to push onwards against greater threats. She broke into a jog as she hit flat ground, wandering the halls like a spirit of destruction and slicing robots in twain with singular hard slashes.

When the halls opened up into a massive hangar, she knew she was in the right place.

***

Bombs. More bombs than Eggma'am would need to reduce the entire world to ashes. Rika stared in horror as they were loaded into massive bays by conveyer belts, robots automatically rotating the building-sized explosives so that they fit into what she could only call magazines. Whatever was big enough to carry these things, it could level cities in hours with this power. If she set them all off here, the pyramid and everything around it for miles would be nothing but a glass crater.

Good. Now she just had to find out how to make that happen.

The complications came immediately. Robots warped in with flashes of red light, but no tell-tale sound of a Ruby. She didn't know exactly how that worked, but she'd been told in the last days of the last war to listen for that deep bass vibration whenever things got weird. She didn't hear it here. These robots were more than real enough to be a threat, and she had to treat them accordingly. Her blade needed care after this, but it would see her through this squadron of pawns and accompanying drones.

Her blade glowed subtle orange as she deflected energy shots over and over, charging forwards and leaping onto the railing to more easily access the flying machines. A quick slash drove through the chopper-blades beneath the robot and sent it spiraling off below, a jump and twist helped her to dodge more of the oncoming fire. She landed and balanced on one foot, swinging her other leg out to kick a pawn over and sent it rolling into the legs of it's fellows before she joined it on the walkway proper. Wide blade swiping in a steel arc, she caught two more shots aimed at her heart and ducked the rest. Over and over again she stabbed and slashed through, cleaving or piercing the plating with her scimitar.

When she thought it was done, something smashed through the ceiling, metal sheering and sparks flying as metal super-heated by the impact scattered and electricity cracked. The red monster of metal rose from where it had dented the bridge, drill spinning like a lance that was pointed directly at Rika. Blue hexagons glowed in a forcefield around the two cockpits, loaded up with two different pawns as it's pilots. Wings of blue extended behind it, and pulses of yellow energy were already firing towards the tiger-wolf before she had time to truly process anything. Her body moved before her mind caught up, sending her into a power-slide along the catwalk that caused the energy bullets to overshoot. There wasn't a moment to catch her breath, because the next thing being fired at her was a giant drill: somehow the tip of that spiral spear had been launched, and a new one was being deployed right after it.

Time slowed down.

Rika watched the hunk of metal the size of a car launch towards her, powered by a thruster on the back. It was big enough to almost scrape the edges of the catwalk's rails as it blasted forwards; too heavy and powerful to deflect, too big and fast to dodge. Rika held her blade out before her anyways, prepared to die on her feet. Her life, brief and pathetic, flashed before her eyes. The foster home that had too many kids to love any of them properly; the "real family" that had only seen her as a problem and wanted nothing to do with her; the years of wandering the world alone.

Maybe next time she'd do better, if there was a next time.

Something else crashed down through the ceiling, catching the drill and screaming like a demon. Blood sprayed, but the attack was deflected. The projectile was sling-shot back around towards the robot, shattering a layer of blue barriers. Rika didn't even get to see the full detail of what had happened, it had been so fast.

Roxie slammed into the ground before her, one arm turned to red pulp up to the elbow, the other still mostly-intact, but lacking the spiked gauntlet.

"I SAID I WASN'T FUCKING FINISHED WITH YOU, DRILL-DO!"

She hadn't even seen the swordswolf behind her, from the looks of it. She charged ahead with one arm, tucking the ruined mass into her jacket as she ran. The moment of staring death in the face had sapped Rika entirely of her energy, leaving her to fall to one knee as Roxie bounced off the railing and started leaping between bombs on the conveyer belts to dodge attacks. The robots didn't dare shoot their own munitions, which saved her from the worst of the shots: no more drills were launched. Roxie got right up in the machine's "face", jumping from it's arm to it's shoulder in order to pummel the blue barriers with one fist. Whatever vulgarities she was shouting were drowned out in the storm of battle, but Rika knew she was shouting with vigor.

She couldn't punch through. The shields were too hard for Roxie to deal with. She got forced off by the spear-arm and sent sprawling back on the catwalk. There, she was temporarily stunned by the impact, and the rattle of the metal bridge shook Rika from her own stupor. Again, her body acted before her mind could catch up, and she was the one protecting Roxie as hot energy blasts rained down. Her sword was glowing hot, but she cut and deflected the shots in a storm of steel and sparks.

"Woah... pretty..." Roxie muttered, giggling to herself as she got up. "What'd'ya call that dark shit?"

"Huh?" Rika took her attention off the barrage for a split second and got slammed in the chest with a shot for her trouble. It was like a punch from a piston-powered arm, sending her sprawling and igniting her shirt. She rolled to smother it, but that got her hot blade against her fur, searing it. Cursing, she rolled back to her feet and patted the worst of the smoldering fur down, keeping her hot scimitar away from herself. Roxie was already moving, rushing ahead to dance with death again.

"You can't hurt it!"

"WATCH ME! COME ON YOU OVER-GROWN FUCKTOY, MY ASS IS BEGGING FOR A DRILLING!"

She spanked herself, turning her back to the enemy and winking at Rika as the robots fired off another spear-tip. Turning, she held out her remaining hand and stood strong.

"That was my weak arm, lemme show you my right hook!"

A singular punch, and her own hand was mangled into uselessness, but the metal projectile had been flipped around. It's spin had only intensified as it was returned to sender, but this time Roxie chased after it while Rika struggled to keep up. When the drill hit the target and started to sheer through more shielding, the red-furred cat was right behind it, leaping just as the thruster cut off and planting a full-spin kick into the hot metal. She didn't seem to care that her boot was burnt from the impact, only that the robot had it's own drill sent through it's primary cockpit. The entire hulk crashed into the catwalk, metal shearing off with a squeal of inanimate agony. Several conveyer belts were ground to a halt and one bomb tipped off it's bracket to roll to the ground with an earth-shaking THUNK.

All was quiet.

They still hadn't completed the objective.

Roxie was passed out with a satisfied grin.

Rika had some choices to make.

***

If Rika screwed this up, she was going to die. There was no way to outrun an explosion of this scale.

The bomb that had rolled off it's bracket stood before her, several bolts sheered off to allow Rika to jam her blade into the seam between the cap and the body of the explosive. She'd been levering it for several minutes now, apparently the defense force for this base had been stymied after the "Dragoon" got totaled. Roxie had woken up after only a few seconds, but she was in no condition to fight, merely keeping watch as Rika worked. On the floor, numbers were scrawled, math that the swordswolf was struggling with and her partner was helpless to assist on. It shouldn't have been complicated...

Several pawnbots had given their bodies to the creation that was being made, an ad-hoc timer of gearwork and a chaos drive battery. The idea was simple: rig this bomb to explode in the bay after an hour had passed, giving them plenty of time to escape the blast radius. Complicating the issue was that Rika had to work with a jury-rigged energy blaster to heat metal and bend it, spend time treating Roxie's injuries, and figure out how to set up a gear train that would give her the desired result despite not having the exact teeth-counts she needed.

"I gotta say, it's pretty cute when you're sticking your tongue out all focused and shit."

"Not into girls."

"I can think you're cute anyways."

Rika grumbled, giving her train another test spin. The motor had been easy enough, since there were motors driving the propellers of the flying robots. The work she'd done over the past years identifying robot parts and what was valuable and how to extract stuff without breaking it was all proving useful for this. She might not have been an engineer, but she wasn't completely hopeless.

A flash of red light made the gearwork gleam, it was soon followed by the tell-tale hum of energy shots building up. The bounty hunter swore, scooping up her sword and dashing to fight the machines. Roxie tried to get up and join her, but she pushed the cat back down as she deflected a blast with her sword. There weren't many robots teleporting in, but any one of them had a chance to set off the exposed bomb. A quick count showed ten pawns and five flying drones, and they were dispatched in only thrice as many seconds. The tiger-wolf dashed through steel and shots, blade a blur as she leapt from drone to drone, skewering them. It dimly occurred to her that this brazen approach was faster and somehow safer than the fight she'd had the first day of Eggma'am's invasion. She shoved that thought aside along with the husk of another robot, her blade scraping against the hole she'd skewered through it.

"Go ahead, keep showing up, I'll harvest you all for parts." She spat into the open air, doubting that anything heard her. Jumping back down from the collapsed catwalk, she returned to tinkering with her gearwork assembly. She'd had to scrap the initial idea of using a 60:1 ratio, not only could she not get the gears for it, but the motor span things way too fast, they'd have closer to a minute before the connection was made between the spinning bar and the stationary one. Instead she'd added layers and layers until the motor had been ratio'd down into almost nothing. It would take closer to sixty thousand turns for the bomb to go off. Hopefully nothing would mess with it.

"Where'd you learn to do that?" Roxie asked, leaning over the tiger-wolf's shoulder.

"Gearwork? Met a guy that was really into pocket watches. Lost the one he gave me as payment, but... well, I get bored at nights."

"Sounds like you could use some company~"

"Not gay."

"Offer's there, I could use a hand, y'know?"

"...Gonna pretend I didn't hear that."

The cat cackled, and Rika finished setting the device up. The ignition portion had been dead simple: just set the same pawn cannon she'd been using to heat metal for the frame up inside the bomb and let it overheat itself into explosion after the switch was tripped. That would set off everything else! She used a piece of scrap metal bent into "pliers" to twist the last connections together, making sure the motor would run without zapping herself in the process.

"Can you walk?"

"I still have legs!"

"Good, because we need to run."

"Uh..."

"I don't know how long that timer's gonna last exactly, but it should be a little over an hour? Let's assume it's less than that."

"Oh. Running running. Because everything goes boom."

"Everything go boom."

"THEN OFF WE GO!"

The armless feline took off at a dead sprint that forced Rika to scoop up her scimitar and give chase. She didn't know where they were within the facility! They were going to get lost and burn time and die if they made too many wrong turns!

"Roxie, we need to retrace our steps!"

"Why do that!?" She said, going in what Rika was pretty sure was the complete opposite direction of the way she'd entered this room. "There's a big door over here that looks like it leads outside!"

"That's not how this works!"

"You're following me anyways!"

"Because you'll die if I leave you alone!"

"Sucks to suck! Just chase my tail and I'll get us out of here!"

When the door refused to open, the bounty hunters didn't slow down. Roxie threw herself into a double-legged kick, and Rika caught her as the steel buckled under the blow. The two of them slipped through the cracked metal opening and were on their way once more in short order. Robots didn't even come close to stopping them, the resistance they met on their escape was cut down or kicked to the curb without stopping to finish fights. A hailstorm of energy bolts surrounded them, but the two were agile enough to avoid the worst of burns and blasts. Roxie made incredible use of her nimble tail, balancing as she sprinted on railings and danced atop machines. Rika had to stay lower to the ground, lacking the same prowess but making up for it with her sword arm.

"Up ahead!"

"I see it!"

Another set of tracks going into a tunnel. The bay doors they'd been looking for. Rushing down it as robots swarmed behind them and teleported ahead was a complete destruction of the senses. Rika's thoughts fuzzed, and all she knew was the flash of steel and the heat of pawnbot shots flying around her. Occasionally, a blur of red would interrupt her vision, slamming robots to and fro to clear the way. The AI that controlled this place (assuming that's what it was) was not keen on letting them go. They didn't care.

Sunlight came down the shaft as they burst through the hidden blast doors, metal rending in a sound that grated on Rika even after hearing it for most of a day. The vertical hole in the ground, lined with concrete and steel, should have been impossible to climb.

The robots being smashed against the wall so hard they spot-welded in places made for a serviceable ladder, and the duo were soon above the ground again and rushing across dunes instead of catwalks.

They didn't speak again until Roxie finally collapsed, the two of them miles away from the pyramid.

"Shit- you okay?" Rika knelt next to the cat, who rolled over with a dopey grin.

"That... was awesome... fuck I'm tired... carry meeeee..."

"We can stop here for now, I want to make sure this thing actua-"

#BOOM

The shockwave sent both of them tumbling to the ground again, blown straight off their feet. Sand rippled outwards so hard and fast that they were temporarily blinded by it. The wind stripped the land down to the more solid stones, and the coarse grit got into every tiny bit of Rika's fur. By the time they recovered, the mushroom cloud was rising high above the horizon and almost all of the other clouds in the sky had been obliterated in a perfect circle.

For a while, Rika wasn't sure what she was hearing beneath the constant ringing, but it eventually registered as laughter.

"FUCKING BALLS TO THE WALLS AWESOME!"

"Yeah..." Rika mumbled. "I think I did... a good job."

Everything hurt. She still forced herself to her feet. Roxie was helpless with laughter, exhaustion, and limb deficiency. The tiger-wolf carried the cat back to the nearest gas station, and there they split the bill to get a cab to their meeting point with the guy that was paying them in the first place.

In the aftermath of walking away with two briefcases full of ring bills, Rika stopped in the street. Opening up both cases, she started stuffing the majority of her share into Roxie's.

"Woah, what the fuck-"

"You don't have arms anymore, you can't keep doing this type of shit. Take ninety, I'll take ten, retire. Go into hiding or whatever the fuck you want, I don't care."

She shoved the overflowing briefcase full of cash into Roxie's chest, forcing her to grab it under a bicep.

"You're welcome, goodbye."

The tiger-wolf left before she could think or regret her decision. She knew it was the right one. Ninety thousand rings would get that cat a manageable life even in the middle of a mess like this. As for her, ten grand was more than enough to live for a while, she'd pick up another job soon enough...

Damn, she'd never get that bike at this rate.
