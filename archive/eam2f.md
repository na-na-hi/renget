#In which sunny goes to bed.

"Today is an good day for you Sunny, you've been promoted."
The halls of facility x394 were quiet, as per usual at this time in the morning, a newly promoted agent was to be given his first job, and even if he didn't look it, Sunny was ready.
"Head that way until you reach the green area, then find the unit for T-02-99, it's only Teth class so it'll be nothing you can't handle."
Sunny looked on, it's not as if he had much to say, even in the middle of a crises he simply watched on. it was as if he wasn't even paying attention most of the time.
but with a task in hand, off he went.

"Don't you wish to sleep?" spoke T-02-99, that sheep looking thing. it's a wonder why the captain picked it as Sunny's first choice. "I can tell you have wonderful dreams, it must be exhausting looking upon such a drab enviroment while you're awake."
while that much is true, Sunny still had a task. blatantly trying to ignore the sheep and just clean as the captain ordered. "your friends are waiting, what are you waiting on?" again, continuing to ignore the sheep, Sunny kept trying to clean up. at least it wasn't the bird that harrased him every hour.
"Do you think Mari would approve of where you're going?"
Sunny stopped, and turned to look at the sheep.
"You live as tool to be used and thrown away, you gave up your will to go on and your friends to join here." T-02-99 spoke... or presumably spoke, it's hard to tell when the thing never wakes up. "Don't you miss them? we can visit Aubrey, Kel, Hero and Mari together... you just need to lie down for a moment..."
A cloud floated by, resting right next to Sunny, almost instinctively he rested upon it, waiting for those final four words.
"And close your eyes..."

It's whitespace, you've been here as long as you can remember.
