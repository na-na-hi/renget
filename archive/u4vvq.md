#Brick Tales

It was a typical afternoon in the park. Kids were playing and being loud as usual, old folks were out and about for a leisurely stroll, and shady men with funny hats could be seen marching back and forth around the basketball court to the beat of their own voices as though they own the damn place. The Maverick slouched on a bench with a can of grape juice in hand and admired the beautiful clouds floating in the sky, lazily tapping his foot to the rhythm of a song he heard from the jukebox back in Gino’s. He took a sip from the can like a king would from a goblet filled with the finest wine, letting the cold juice slosh in his mouth before gulping. Ah, what a wonderful day it is. Shame his trusted disciple couldn’t make it today and join him. Instead, he was out here stuck with Kim who clearly doesn’t enjoy his company, standing at a considerable distance away from him and off doing her own thing near the slide. Oh well, her loss. The Maverick closed his eyes and took another sip.

“Please! You’re the only one she would listen to. Y-you have to help me!” yelled someone. The Maverick was unceremoniously snapped out of his reverie and opened his eyes to the sight of a blond boy kneeling before Kim, bowing his head down so low his nose almost touched the grass. “I…I just want it back… please…” The Maverick crinkled his nose in secondhand embarrassment. Sure looks like someone’s getting desperate. Kim had told him the deal with this boy before, Basil, yes that was his name. Apparently, he’s been following Kim around everywhere lately asking her to talk Aubrey into giving back a certain photo album that belonged to him.

“For the last time, talk to her yourself you creep! Stop bothering me!” Kim bellowed, scaring away the birds in the vicinity. “You want it back so bad then go get it yourself!” She spat in his direction and walked away, not even looking at the boy. How cold. Not easily deterred, Basil grabbed her by the ankle of her shoe with both hands.  “Kim…please. Help me.” Tears were streaming down his face and it was at that moment that The Maverick felt something stir inside him. “No!” A swift kick to the shoulder and the boy was down, crumpled over in pain. This has gone too far. The Maverick has to step in!

“Halt!” he yelled, getting between the two. “Stop this at once, Kim! Have mercy on him!”

Thoroughly unimpressed, the girl simply scoffed and turned to walk away without looking back. “Whatever. I’m going home.”

Basil was still down and was covering his face with both hands. Muffled sobs could be heard as the pigeons that scattered away moments ago returned to their position as if nothing had happened. What a sad display. Without thinking, The Maverick’s hand wandered to the boy’s shoulder. “Stop crying and stand up. Everything’s okay now for I, The Maverick, has come to save you!” Basil sat there unmoving, his fingers tightly gripping at the blades of grass, examining the handsome face of his savior in awe. “I….thank you.” The boy pulled away from him and dusted his knees off. A few more deep breaths and some stretching and he was back to normal. 

“Basil was it? Call me… The Maverick,” he said, playfully punching him on his side to which Basil jumped back in response as if driven by instinct. “Ah!”

“Easy there flower boy,” he said, slowly putting both of his hands up in the air. “I’m not gonna hurt you, I promise. I don’t pick on the weak, no offense. Besides, what happened between you and Aubrey in the past is none of my business so don’t even think of asking me about getting back that photo album of yours, got it?”

Basil nodded. “I understand. Sorry.”

The two stood under a dappled shade of a tree. A cool breeze flew by making him sweep his magnificent hair in style. Deep down, The Maverick knew that he couldn’t just let things remain the way they were. Something needed to change. “Though I won’t be able to help you with your album,” he said, walking closer as he smoothly combed his hair with his fingers, “I might be able to help you through some other means.” 

This caught the boy’s attention, as expected. “What do you mean?”

The Maverick buffed up his chest and struck a pose. “What you’re lacking is confidence, my friend. Seeing you grovel like that before Kim was sad, not gonna lie. Fortunately for you, I, The Maverick, has limitless supply of the stuff! And I am more than happy to share it with those in need. So fret not, for the time has come for you to become the man you were always meant to be!”

Basil stood there with his mouth open. That ought to do the trick. “So, what do you say?” he said, offering a hand to him. The flower boy took it after some time and The Maverick squeezed his hand, making him wince in pain. “W-What are we doing exactly?”

“First off, we need to hone that body of yours,” he said, flexing his bountiful muscles. “Don’t you know, having a good physique is the key to getting every girl to love you!” he added. Basil looked at him as though he just said something really weird. He’ll come to appreciate his wisdom in no time. “Just run laps around the basketball court until I tell you to stop.” Basil shook his head and shrunk back. “I’m not sure if I can. Sorry.”

“Don’t give me that crap!” he roared. “Of course you can. Now get to it! I believe in you!”

Basil heaved a sigh. “I’ll try.”

“Do or do not, there is no try! Now go!”

Spurred by his words, Basil walked to the court right away and started running. After ten minutes of running straight, stopping by occasionally to catch his breath, Basil couldn’t take it anymore and collapsed on the ground with ragged breaths. Despite all odds, he actually did it! The Maverick sat next to him and tapped him on the shoulder. “You did well, my student. But that was just the warm up. Now the real stuff begins.”

The poor boy looked like he was about to die. The Maverick gazed at him proudly. He could tell that the boy was in a very bad shape but still, he managed to do what was asked of him. Impressive indeed.

The Maverick stood up. “On second thought, let’s continue your training tomorrow. I don’t want you dying on my watch. But remember, things are going to get much harder from here on out so prepare yourself my student!”

Basil got up and bowed to him. “Yes… M-Master!” The Maverick jumped back. Did he just say what he heard him say? Hearing another person call him that again sent shivers up his spine. It was at that moment that he decided that he won’t ever forsake his new student. 

Together, they will become legends.
