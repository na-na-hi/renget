Hahaha! So you found my little secret! Good job, anon! You've won yourself a prize. But first, if you haven't already finished reading the writefag, please go do that first! You were almost finished!

If you're all read up and want to have your prize, here it is. This is a non-canon ending to the writefag that I scrapped because Sandy felt too out of character. But I wrote it anyway because I liked parts of it a lot. As a note, I'll mention in this version Mio was standing at this time. Anyway, once you're ready, go ahead and scroll down!

###POP! POP! BOOM! POP!

![No, there's not another secret. You're looking at it now!](https://ak-d.tripcdn.com/images/100d1a00000190cdz5768.jpg)

Fireworks erupted in the sky, the light illuminating both of their faces for seconds at a time. And yet, neither looked away. For Mio, looking away right now was akin to losing, and she refused to lose to Sandatsu here and now. Even when he placed his hand onto the tree she was leaning against, she didn't even blink.

However, what did end up breaking her focus was when Sandatsu started to lean in towards her. Her eyes widen and it feels like time crawls to a stop. Her eyes break away from his and look up at his arm. This is...

...

*'K-Kabedon!? Where did this roach learn something like that!? INIGO!'*

Her eyes widen in surprise and her breath hitches. A bead of sweat forms on her head and her eyes flick over to the other festival goers. Everyone is distracted either by the fireworks display or... preoccupied by kissing the person they're with.

...

Nobody is paying attention to them.

...

Nobody is watching.

...

...

...

Nobody would know.

...

...

...

Her eyes return to Sandatsu. She takes a deep breath and closes her eyes. It'll be okay.

...

...

...

...

...


Then she raises her knee directly into his groin.

The boy groans and hunches over, giving her the perfect opportunity to follow up. She slams her skull into his face with all her might, causing his front teeth break and his nose to crack. Blood flows from his face and splatters, getting a bit of it onto Mio, but she doesn't seem to care about that at all.

=="WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING!?"==

Mio returns to shoving memories into his head so she can scream at him without anybody noticing. The memory Mio kicks her chair over in a fit of anger. Sandatsu activates his quirk, rewinding the damage he just incurred and pulling the splotches of blood off of Mio and back into his body.

"I thought we were having a moment."

=="A WHAT!?"==

"There was like an energy going on between us."

=="**NO!** THERE'S NO ENERGY! THERE'S NO MOMENT, YOU FUCKING CREEP!"==

Memory Mio slams her fist onto the desk in front of her as she screams as loud as she can. Normal Mio's face has a look of complete disgust and she starts to back away from Sandatsu.

=="YOU'RE AN UNLOVABLE FREAK OF NATURE! TRY TO REMEMBER THAT NEXT TIME YOU SHOOT FOR A GIRL SO FAR OUT OF YOUR LEAGUE WE MAY AS WELL NOT BE ON THE SAME-"==

Memory Mio fades away just before flipping the desk in front of her. Mio shakes her head and tries to walk away, but stumbles. All the implanting of memories to communicate, changing memories, and having to touch Drekus' memories have been straining her mind and draining the pitiful amount of energy she had had left throughout the night. That bout of anger she just went pushed her over her limit.

"Fuck..."

"You okay?"

Sandatsu walks up towards her, still maintaining his neutral expression. It was like he wasn't even fazed by the awkward situation they just went through only seconds ago.

"I'm fine. Just get the fuck away from... me..."

It was a clear lie. Mio could feel that she was crashing, and fast. Her body had been requesting rest for hours, and now it was no longer asking. There was no way she was going to be able to get home like this. Her mind was sluggish and forcing herself to think hard was like trudging through a swamp. What options did she have right now? Ashleigh? There's no way. She didn't even know where her sister was right now. Even if she tried calling her, she would undoubtedly bring along her stupid classmates, especially Imai. There was no telling what they'd do with her in such a terrible state.

"You look like you're about to die."

"Shut... up..."

She growls at Sandatsu and tries to pick herself up, but it was useless. There was only one option left. It truly made her sick to her stomach that she was going to have to resort to this, but there wasn't any other way she could think of right now in her current condition.

"Hey, caveman."

She tries to look strong while she speaks, but her drooping head and slow speech makes it look more like she's having her final stand. Having to rely on Sandatsu was one of the things she'd never imagine willingly doing, but right now her options are limited. Besides, her being weak in front of him wasn't anything new; it was one of the reasons she hated him. But because of that, in this position he was... trustworthy? Not the word she'd use, but it was kind of close. It was more like he was a known quantity. He's had a hundred opportunities to kill her or ruin her in the past, but he hasn't. Right now, she just has to gamble on the chance that wouldn't change.

"If you let anybody find out I asked you this, I'll... Fuck, I can't think. Just get... get me home. Your pea brain remembers where I live, right? I need to... I need to get home."

Sandatsu stares at her for a few moments, silent and unmoving. If he wasn't always like this, he'd look more intimidating. Instead, Mio just got more annoyed the longer he waited to answer. Another blast of fireworks goes off, lighting up behind Sandatsu and shrouds his face in darkness. He takes a step towards the half conscious Mio and scoops her up off the ground. She immediately tries to squirm from out of his grasp to no avail.

"Hey, you shithead. Put me down. I don't need... to be carried, I just... need a shoulder to lean on."

Despite her energyless words, Mio's body is betraying her desires. She can feel her consciousness swiftly fading as she's carried by Sandatsu. Her vision blurs and her eyelids are fluttering.

"Stop complaining. You're acting like a kid."

"You... bastard. I'll... I'll remember this..."

Mio's eyes close and her breathing evens out. In only a moment, she was out like a light. Her head droops down and to the side, resting against Sandatsu. Silently, the boy enters the treeline once again and heads away from the festival. It would take a while to get to Mio's house, but he's walked much much further before, and it's not like the girl in his arms weighs that much. Besides, she's surprisingly soft. Kind of like a pillow or a marshmallow or...

Mio shifts in her sleep, and her hands find the stuffed cat he had tucked away. Slowly, she pulls the stuffed animal towards herself in a hug and settles again.

...Or something like that. Whatever. He's starting to get confused thinking about this stuff.

I hope you enjoyed it! If you've seen this message, I kind of want to know. How about... you say that the stage image from the writefag is a little too big? It really is the biggest image for no reason. Takes up a huge chunk of the screen. Anyway, thanks for reading!
