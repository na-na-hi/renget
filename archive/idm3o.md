Blood-Lust.

Their heads held nothing but dark thoughts for as long as they could remember. A broken soul lovingly gazing another broken soul, as if they could reach out to the traumas lurking behind their eyes and make themselves better.
Aubrey had already forgone her rational side. The moment she walked into Sunny's room all her pent-up feelings caught up to her, she felt as if she finally understood what Sunny went through. All the pain he's been feeling while rotting inside this empty room, how it must have eaten him from the inside to keep quiet about it, how she never came to visit him...

What really broke her from her thoughts was Sunny forgiving her. To give such a warm-hearted response even after all she did to him...
She had to make it up for him.

Only moments had passed since Aubrey reached out for that kiss. It was everything she ever wanted, to stare into her sunshine's eyes after sharing a loving moment with him. After their lips separated though, she still felt so far apart from him. She wanted to be as close as she can to Sunny, to truly share in the pain he felt all this time.
Suddenly, she felt an itch around her stomach. It was the scar Sunny gave her when they met at the park, the heat of that moment, the first time they've seen each other in years, it still made Aubrey's heart beat faster thinking about it.

Aubrey traced her fingers along her scar, feeling the slight irritation on her skin. Sunny seemed downcast recalling the moment he hurt Aubrey, but his eyes widened when the girl landed her head on his shoulders, whispering something to him before nibbling on his ear.
"Do you still have that knife?"


In and out. In and out. The ill-fated lovers followed the rhythm of their hearts, beating together as one.
Sunny was struggling to maintain his grip as he felt Aubrey kneading on him. Every time her body tensed around his he would let out hushed cries of pleasure through gritted teeth. She was pecking at his neck, staring lustfully at her lover while taking her hands to his face. Aubrey moved her mouth up to prepare for another kiss, and Sunny moving his empty hand behind her neck, caressing her long hairs and sending another tingle running down her neck.
It was liberating. After all the turbulence, Aubrey's mind finally felt clear. Years of mixed feelings, abuse, panic, she felt them all bleeding off from her as she closed the distance of their lips. She tightened her grasp on Sunny, digging her nails on his back as to never let him go, a feeling of pure bliss overtaking her. 
She was almost biting into Sunny's lip when they separated, a string of saliva chained the two together as she stared into her sunshine's eyes with intoxicating love. Suddenly, she lets out a soft moan as she feels a chill running against her inner thigh, the steel slicing into her makes her drop her weight on Sunny before she goes back to biting into his cheek.

Sunny could taste his handiwork coming through. The warm crimson painting over his hand made a nice contrast with the coldness of the blade. The two of them could feel their eyes shifting away, struggling to look ahead while they raced against their bloodlust. Sunny thrust once more, now having trouble telling the fluids that covered their bodies apart. The reaction got Aubrey to climb over again in savoring adrenaline, reaching her hand back and snatching the knife from her lover's hand.
It was Aubrey's turn. With a warm smile, she pressed the steak knife against Sunny's stomach. Sunny could feel the tip of the blade poking into his skin, with Aubrey's expression making him reminisce of his dreams, he didn't think he had seen her wear such a bright smile before. With his now freed hand, Sunny returned to running his fingers on her chest, taking the extra care to feel every inch of her before the big finale.

Aubrey slowly sunk the blade into Sunny, taking care to hit the same spot of her scar. This got a reaction from the often emotionless boy, his legs spasming under her as he let out another moan. Sunny could feel the chill of the blade inside him being overtaken by the warmth of his blood-spill, covering him and Aubrey even more. The way his grip on her breasts tightened as he got stabbed also made her whimper, almost losing her balance and falling out of bed.
There was too much blood around them. Aubrey lifted her hand from Sunny's stomach and caressed her face, painting red over his eyepatch with her fingers.

"A-Aubrey...I love you..."
They were tired.
"I love you too, Sunshine..."
Aubrey softly twirled her fingers around his hair, giving her lover a final gesture and kiss before sending him off.

In and out. In and out.
Aubrey chose to alternate the strikes between her and Sunny, no longer aiming for just their stomachs.  Each and every stab spilling more blood, drenching themselves in their lover's sanguine, pulling them closer to each other more than ever. The pink-haired girl finally let out once she could see Sunny's eyes sliding back as his body fell weak under her, and soon enough, lightheadedness consumed her too. Grabbing onto his hand, Aubrey fell embraced on Sunny's body. The lovers finally free from all their turmoils.
