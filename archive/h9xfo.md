## Doe scientist 

>"And another failure!" a familiar voice echoed down the hall of your local research institute
>You had been heading to your car after a long day of research and testing but you couldn't help but check to see if the voice coming from the lab was who you thought it was
>You knock a few times and open the lab door, and sure enough you see the unmistakable form of Valarie, an intelligent, fit, and attractive doe who also happened to be your best friend on campus. She was leaning over a table cluttered with petri dishes and holding some sort of spray can in her hand
"hey Val, how're you doing?"
>She turns to greet you, and to your surprise you see that not only is her lab coat unbuttoned, its apparently the only thing she's wearing
>"Oh, hey Anon! I'm good, how are you?" she says, knocking you out of your stupor of seeing you best friend mostly naked.
>You close the lab door behind you and stammer out a response
"Uh, g-good, w-what are you doing?"
>The doe in question perks up "oh, some sort of collab project with the civil engineering division, they're trying to develop macro resistant architecture" 
>Valarie gestures to the table with the petri dishes on it, looking closer you can see tiny cities inside of them, most in various states of disrepair
>"They're making me doo all sorts of tests on these things, trying to see if they survive anything and every thing a macro might put the through"
>She sets down the spray can she had been holding and picks up a clipboard and crossing something off "none of the test have been successful so far" she explains before looking back at the spray can "I think that last one was supposed to simulate stomach acid"
>you glance through some of the tiny cities before turning your attention back towards your friend
“That's cool and all but I have to ask, why are you…lacking most of your clothes”
>Valarie grins before turning towards you “oh come on, you should know that macros preferred ways of causing destruction are rather…lewd”
>She grabs one of the petri dishes with a pristine city in it and sets it in front of her
>”For example” she says as she lowers one of her breasts into the petri dish and onto the tiny city, the comparatively massive mammary crushing nearly every building inside.
>She gives you a teasing smirk before stand back up and grabbing her clipboard 
>”Another failure” she says, nonchalantly
>You feverishly try to suppress you blush and respond in anything more than a stuttering mess  
“You…don’t seem very concerned that none of the tests are working”
>The doe shrugs “I didn’t make these tiny cities, I’m just trying to see how much punishment they can take, its actually really fun tearing these things apart, I’ve always sort of wondered what it would be like to be a macro”
>she reaches down into another petri dish and pulls something else out
>”Some of them also have these cute little gel people” she says, squishing it somewhat between her fingers
>She appears to be deep in thought before she smirks and places the gel model in between her breast and squishing it between them
>”I bet you wish you were in this little guy’s place huh” she says
>You desperately try remain composed at the display
“What do you mea-”
>She cuts you off “don’t act coy Anon, I saw the way you were looking at that vixen macro that tore through that town just down the road, and she’s not the only one I caught you ogling. Admit it Anon, you like big girls don’t you. Like, BIG girls”
>you think of making up a response before you decide against it
“Well…maybe I do…”
>She chuckles “I thought so” she says before glancing up at the clock hanging over the door
>The doe moves over to another table before grabbing a device you recognize as one of the labs shrink rays
>”It's about time for me to head home, but if you were to volunteer to be shrunk down to a few inches tall, we could run some “experiments”...in my bedroom”
>You glance between the shrink ray and you, admittedly, very attractive friend
>Not a bad offer, not a bad offer at all
