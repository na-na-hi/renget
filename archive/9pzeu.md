>It was another stressful week for anon
>He had to pick up a couple extra shifts because his coworkers kept fucking him over
>he was having trouble sleeping and getting some actual food because of that
>lots of other bullshit was going on that he didn't have the energy for, but he did get back to his apartment
>all he had left to do was crawl in his bed
>it was 11 p.m., too exhausted to shower, he kicked off his shoes and his gross work pants and got in bed after a few shots
>fucking finally
>....
>he woke up at 2 a.m. again
>"god damn it" he thought to himself
>he tried to raise his hand to grab his phone and...
>nothing
>he tried again
>nothing
>maybe his arm was just asleep? let's try the other ar-
>nope
>well FUCK

>he tried to blink
>nothing
>he couldn't even sit up
>now all he could do was look around his dark room, wondering how long this shit was going to last
>he looked at the clock again
>2:17 a.m. 
>that's when he heard some scratches
>"FUCKING RATS? AGAIN? I SWEAR TO GOD I-"
>something interrupted his silent rant
>It was sitting in the corner of his room
>he thought it was just the pile of laundry that was sitting on his chair, and then it started moving
>his heart raced
>he finally managed to open his mouth and whisper "what...the"
>he tried to blink again
>whatever it was it was standing over him and smiling
>all the sudden it got very, very cold
>it leaned in closer
>he couldn't quite make out what it was, maybe it was the couple shots of whiskey he took before bed or maybe he was just having a nightmare
>yeah that explains it-

>It opened it's mouth and spoke: "Hello, Anon"
>what 
>"Yeah. I'm your sleep paralysis demon" he raised 2 clawed hands and made air quotes
>At least he has a sense of humor
>But still, how in the fuck-
>Anon watched it cock it's head and saw a flat, dark head grow a pair of horns, then vanish again
>"I'm not going to waste time explaining what I'm doing here."
>It vanished
>He looked at the clock
>2:25 a.m.
>A hand grabbed his throat and squeezed, surprisingly light for something so big
>Now it was on his bed looking down at him
>Rows of teeth formed out of seemingly nowhere while his eyes grew and shrunk to an odd size, then went back to normal
>the horns were back
>now his hand around his throat was a tentacle, one of many, apparently.
>How the fuck did he not notic-
>He felt a basic jolt through his body, tried to get up, scream, do anything
>"You're not going anywhere"

>At least the room got a little warmer
>Anon figured it was best to just lay there
>It's not like he could move anyway
>Now it was sitting on top of him
>Anon took the chance to finally get a look at this thing up close
>It was very dark but slightly transparent, almost like black fog 
>he shifted his gaze lower and lower and saw a huge, puffy sheathe and a pair of equally large balls
>he looked back up
>the horns were gone, replaced by antlers and a skull for a face
>he felt something wet slap on his shirt and watched the creature's fat dick slide out of his sheathe
>the smell of wet moss, and the overwhelming stench of dick hit his nose instantly
>he wasn't even half-way hard and there was maybe 6 inches sitting there, throbbing every couple seconds
>he looked back up and saw it hunched over, fingering itself with his tentacles, gasping? moaning? screaming? while he used his two real hands to pull down anon's underwear
>Anon blinked again
>now it was back to a faceless creature with horns, smiling up at him while he sniffed his dick

>"Wow. I can smell how pent up you are. I'm gonna be here a while"
>Anon couldn't even think about what that meant because he felt the oddly warm creature's mouth completely incase his dick
>he felt teeth lightly grazing his junk while a very fat, skilled tongue lovingly wrapped around his entire length, stroking it
>The demon started bobbing his head in a steady rhythm, making sure to get extra spit all over his lap
>Anon couldn't even scream about how amazing this felt. He was getting the best blowjob of his life and could only stare at this creature in silence
>he blinked and now the demon's muscular, fat ass was over his face, gently spread by the tentacles he was fucking himself with earlier
>was that a tail? huh-
>Then he felt an oddly nice pressure as the demon kneeled above him and lowered his ass even more
>"EAT" it commanded. 
>Oh now Anon's tongue and lips work. Still can't talk though. How fucking convenient.

>It's like it was in two places at once, sitting on his face and sucking his dick at the same time
>Anon did his best to please the demon sitting on his face, using lots of tongue and slow kisses. Every now and then he would feel the demon push back on his face slightly, or shift down so he could worship his sweaty taint
>Anon heard it groaning above him, almost like 3 people were talking, panting, and moaning at the same time
>He must have been doing something right....because it started shuddering
>Anon blinked again
>then he felt a slight tingle in his dick and pressure as the creature started hotdogging him between his fat, muscular ass
>Anon looked up again
>200 pounds of muscular demon was staring back down at him, tongue out, drooling, with his knot stuck in his sheathe
>That poor thing....
>"THIS ISN'T FUNNY DAMN IT." 
>It fucking growled at him, and stopped to keep panting
>"I. NEED IT. NOW"
>The demon sat down on anon's length in one motion
>It let out a scream that no amount of liquor or therapy would ever help Anon forget

>"MORE". It screamed. "MOOOOOORE"
>Anon was already balls deep, what-
>Time seemed to slow down while it started straddling anon's hips and building into a rhythm
>He watch the demon's dick slap against his own belly with every thrust
>He heard it snort and felt a rope of precum hit his face
>Wow
>It kept riding him, slowly lifting himself up because Anon couldn't move his fucking hips
>Anon blinked again
>Now it looked like a wolf with curled horns, sitting up straight, fully straddling anon's dick with ease
>Anon made the mistake of trying to move his arm

>It pinned his shoulders down and got in real close to his face
>Then he felt his mouth being pried open by the demon's tongue
>It was so thick he should have normally been suffocating on it, but now it just felt right as it slowly went down his throat
>He could feel his throat trying to tense up and gag, but it stopped just as fast as it started
>He blinked and the demon was sitting on his dick again, wiggling his hips and grunting
>The demon roared and really started riding him now
>The demon started slamming down on anon's hips
>over and over, and over. 
>Panting, screaming, the demon's fat dick was now pointed up at itself, while he crushed anon's hips at the rate he was going
>Anon heard it start whimpering and growling before he felt a vice grip on his dick 
>He could feel it clamping down on him, milking his dick dry, while the demon let out a very weak moan and shot a load all over anon's chest, face, bed frame, and the wall behind him

>Anon felt it collapse on top of him slightly, before sitting back up, clearly spent
>It looked down at Anon, still unable to talk or move, but was now about to black out
>"I'LL BE BACK" it screamed at him while melting into thin air

>It was 11:00 A.M. when Anon woke up
>Holy fuck he got 9 hours of sleep without waking up? What the-
>Anon tried to recall that fucking nightmare he had. He looked around the room, and even moved his arms for good measure
>Then he looked down at his underwear
>completely fucking soaked
>that was the first time he came in his sleep in years. Odd
>He threw those aside, got on some sweat pants and went into the kitchen for some coffee while that nightmare slipped from his mind before the coffee got finished brewing
