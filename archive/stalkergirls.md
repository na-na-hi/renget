No thoughts, head empty... Well, not exactly. It's filled with thoughts about a rock, of all things.

These, ahem, "researchers" couldn't possibly have picked a better location for their base. The girl is cute, I guess. Cute in how hard she tries.

##Duty-chan

It will not be an exaggeration to call the Duty faction, comprised mostly of former soldiers of the VSU, the last line of defense that protects the world as we know it from the dangers that lurk within this wretched place widely known as the Zone. Day in and day out the Dutyers give it their all to exterminate the vermin that threatens to spill out beyond the Zone's borders, of both human and mutant nature. Led by none other than the esteemed General Voronin himself, the members of the Duty faction readily extend a helping hand to those in need of protection from the hazards of the Zone, and accept praises and gifts from the thankful rescuees with utmost humility. An example to follow for the allies of humanity, and a Damocles' sword for the scum of the Zone that has still somehow miraculously eluded the Duty's wrath.
