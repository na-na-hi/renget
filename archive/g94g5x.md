>he said he knew a guy
>Sonic was a very sociable person when he wanted to be so you had no idea what his guy was
>but getting your phone running again would be nice
>no idea how they'd deal with the carrier thing out here
>there was civilization, yeah
>tons of towns with animal people and the like
>but it wasn't like they were high tech
>but Sonic swore up and down he'd get this guy to fix up anything
>out of curiosity you agreed
>you didn't expect the trek to lead to the most pristine beach
>the hedgehog could outpace you whenever he liked but prefered letting you set the pace when you both walked
>the mechanic ship/airstrip up past the beach seemed to be about the best guess where his friend was 
>when you brought up restoring your phone the first thing the hedgehog replied with was to ask if he needed sluttier attire 
>it wasn't that though
>you'd never need porn at the rate he drained your balls
>it was like he'd practically sense the slightest twitch in your dick at this point
>then bam you'd be fucking him into green hills of grass for a couple hours
>he vanished across the ocean in a blink and came back in a bikini bottom that barely covered his junk and a tight white top that didn't cover anything down past his nipples
>his shoes ditched for sandals
>"too much?" he inquired while spinning with a flourish to give you a good look
>you suggested he should probably dress a little up for his friend
>"I'm just going to tell him you plow me every night"
>you raised an eyebrow
>just such a matter of fact tone in his voice
>"what are friends for?"
>he shrugged and smirked
>well, what could you do?
>at least you might be able to get power to your phone again
>these people treated it like alien technology and you guessed it was
>you were an alien
>it was nice to just bask in the sun 
>Sonic seemed to take time to stretch and show off the outfit a little
>you noticed a exhibitionist streak in him
>he at least kept it in your pants when you went through the little villages 
>outside town limits he practically had to be peeled off you
>here was no different 
>he was eyefucking you with the brief amount of privacy he had
>no other reason he'd be pushing his chest out in your direction 
>you knew he got off you wanting him
>it was a victory 
>not sure how fucking him into a drooling mess was a win for him
>well it had been fun
>so fine you'd play along
>you leaned over and groped his dick through the bottom
>you weren't completely in the mood but why not humor him a little 
>"tease," he whined as you pulled away
>you asked again if he was really sure his friend would be ok with the whole… all of this
>"oh chill out"
>you had your reservations 
>at least that pink number was sort of sporty
>this new outfit just screamed "I take it violently up the ass"
>didn't help it practically flossed his ass
>a thin strip of yellow in a sea of blue
>he made a point of sauntering in front of you
>he smiled over his shoulder when he deliberately stopped and shoved his ample ass back
>his hands reached back as he ground into your hips
>you were trying not to engage
>trying really really hard not to
>just then something clicked in his head and he vanished
>the hedgehog was back in seconds
>"almost forgot to accessorize"
>the most garish solid pink sunglasses
>definitely seemed to be his preferred color by now
>he tossed a black pair to you
>"c'mon, let's go see Tails"
>Tails?
>you companion was called Sonic so who were you to really judge on names
>so Tails was your tech guru, supposedly
>Sonic hadn't talked about much more than that
>you figured you'd trust him 
>that hadn't exactly gotten you great results but it wasn't like you had much to lose
>at least this new world was sort of peaceful
>if this Tails ran a shop and hangar you wondered how much high tech stuff existed here
>Sonic did mention fighting robots 
>how he'd fight them now, looking like he was doing an Onlyfans photo shoot at the beach, you didn't know
>he was still fast and still agile
>sometimes his infatuation with you made you forget that
>he'd fold like cardboard the second you laid a hand on him
>fighting robots seemed impossible in your eyes
>well hopefully that wouldn't come up any time soon to prove you wrong
>Sonic knocked his fist on the door and there was a lot of clattering on the other side of the door
>"just a minute," a panicked voice on the other side remarked
>Sonic just let himself in anyways
>you first noticed the ass
>and the two giant fluffy tails above it
>jean coveralls, ending at the thigh seemed to cover up everything
>was Sonic just doing the nude thing earlier to tease you?
>he seemed to be the only funny animal person that hadn't been wearing pants around you
>anyways, Tails was ass up buried in the internals of a bi plane
>he was doing something in there to the point he didn't notice company in the shop
>Sonic clearly felt like being mischievous and made his way over and gave the exposed ass a swift slap
>"Sonic!"
>wait…
>you were understandably taken aback
>he just smacked his friend on the ass
>you never smacked friends on the ass
>was it like a football thing?
>the recipient of the spanking pushed himself up and you got a good look
>he was a fox
>not as in foxy
>well, that too
>but he was also as much a fox as Sonic was a hedgehog 
>yellow fur with some white markings on the tails 
>which, made total sense for a name now
>his fur was shorter on his head 
>bright blue eyes looked to his companion 
>the overalls and a decent scuffed pair of sneakers were all he wore
>he got a good look at Sonic's outfit and you'd never seen someone blush that red through white fur
>you had a feeling the new outfit might have attracted that look and you agreed just because monkey brain decisions 
>Sonic grabbed your attention however
>"where are my manners? Tails, boytoy. Boytoy, Tails."
>he introduced you two to each other with the flair and presentation of a trained magician on stage
>you'd be discussing who was the boytoy later 
>but Tails got it I his head to nervously offer a handshake which you accepted
>Sonic leaned over to his ear and whispered for a lot longer than you trusted 
>especially since Tails' eyes darted over to your crotch and just as quickly tried not to stare
>then you were asked to present the phone
>for the time being you could bunk here too
>so that was a nice offer
>the amount of crap the fox had built or salvaged was incredible 
>you decided to make yourself busy looking
>you had it confirmed for your own eyes robots existed when you found a salvaged… Sonic?
>you hefted up a silver head and torso out of the pile
>you saw another Sonic
>and another
>you called Sonic over
>"ohhhh. yeah I've got fans I guess."
>he leaned against you 
>"the whole red monoeye thing doesn't really compare to yours truly."
>he was a little confused himself
>"don't know why Tails collected them though. I thought mecha there was blown up."
>he pointed over to a lanky blue one 
>Tails had them all apparently 
>Sonic regaled you with a few adventures 
>all the while Tails tinkered around with your phone at his work table
>"you know," the hedgehog said in a whisper up to your ear, "let's go behind the bi plane and I'll show you there's something I can do better than those robots."
>but Tails was right there
>"you'll just have to fuck my face so I won't make noise."
>well
>you'd have to admit defeat here and you had him guide you behind the plane, in the most secluded corner of the shop
>he wasted no time undoing your pants 
>he whipped your dick out and gave you a grin as he lowered himself 
>you were constantly looking over your shoulder
>he was stealing away your resolve and focus as he kissed your dick
>you felt a laugh against your manhood as he knew he was winning you over
>fine, but you'd make this quick
>you had to admit the new outfit was got
>to yourself 
>he already knew you liked it
>the proof was draped over his face, his pink sunglasses pushed up on his forehead 
>he mouthed the words "I'm waiting"
>the look on his face was mocking
>begging for it
>welp
>you pulled back and gripped his head with both hands
>shoving your dick past his lips was easy
>he didn't resist whatsoever 
>the hedgehog boy sucked on your cock eagerly while you pumped his face
>eventually the tension eroded away and you were just going to town
>Tails wasn't a concern right now 
>right now you were too conercened using your partner's throat like a fleshlight
>you rarely ever got a blowjob before and this opportunity to cut loose was fantastic 
>Sonic really was skilled at taking dick
>he made the strangest, sloppiest noises 
>you hoped it wasn't too loud
>but right now that was wasn't the biggest concern 
>you were about to bust a nut and his hands braced on your thighs, prepping himself 
>his cock leaked precum as it peaked out of the bottom
>you rammed your dick harder and harder
>one final thrust and you growled 
>he gulped down your load without a compliant 
>only after he'd squeezed the last drop out of you did he pull off
>his hand grasped your softening dick and he threw up a thumbs up and winked
>a click above you
>what the fuck?
>you looked up and you heard scrambling off the biplane 
>"i'msorryhetoldmetodoit"
>your glare shot back down to the hedgehog
>he dusted himself off as he stood
>he just shrugged and readjusted his bathing suit 
>no excuses 
>no wisecracking
>just carried on business as usual
>it wasn't like him
>the photo however, that was him
>at least the phone must be working
>Tails avoided all eye contact
>just pretended to busy himself with his work bench
>he was as shocked as you when Sonic pulled him into a sloppy kiss
>it didn't take you long to figure out what happened
>when Sonic broke the kiss he showed his clean tongue to you
>"Tails here, he's super bashful. I just had to coax him a little. Believe it or not you're looking at the guy I practiced kissing with."
>he grabbed the fox's shoulder and kissed him on the forehead
>so they were really really good friends apparently
>your raised eyebrow had him clarifying
>"as cute he is, we've only ever done first base. you know, just bros being bros."
>Tails refused eye contact and twiddled his thumbs
>you realized he didn't spit after that kiss
>Sonic leaned over and whispered into his friends ear
>that got him even more flustered
>"I'm not going to call him daddy," the fox whispered back louder than he should
>the hushed conference continued and you just watched 
>was Sonic trying to whore out his friend to you?
>Tails was kind of cute
>not as built as the hedgehog but he had a twink quality to him
>what he lacked in legs he at least made up for everywhere else
>plus those tails were fluffy
>but it felt weird to do that with another guy 
>you weren't the cucking type
>even if Sonic was cool with it
>you didn't know how serious the hedgehog treated this though
>just not your cup of tea
>they both seemed to break off the conversation 
>you had no idea what had been planned
>sexy or not, you'd have to put your foot down
>Sonic spoke up first, with Tails back to trying not to make eye contact while his cheeks glowed red
>"bad news buddy. turns out Tails only has one bunk around here. you don't mind do you?"
>clever 
>very clever
>you'd at least see where this went
