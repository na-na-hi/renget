Episode 01
When I heard that we were chosen by the Shinju-sama, I thought that was an amazing thing.
But exactly how amazing it was, I didn't fully realize.
Just that, once I heard that the enemies that were coming would destroy the world,
I thought that I must fight.
In the beginning, I lost myself in that feeling.
At that time, even in my dreams, it never even occurred to me that we would end up [sacrificing] our [bodies] to keep fighting on.
 
Episode 02
When I first met Minowa Gin,
I thought that she would be difficult to deal with.
Her voice was loud...
and she was so strong-willed...
that it overwhelmed me.
But after we became closer, I realized that she was a really good girl.
However, that [kindness] was to be the cause of her [death]...
 
Episode 03
One plus one plus one would not equal three, but ten.
We three believed that we could do it.
We had to believe we could.
The enemy is called "Vertex":
Abominations born from the virus.
We have to repel them.
However, to call those beings "Vertex"...
Why call them a word which means "pinnacle"?
At that time, the fact that the Vertex were [created] by the [gods] was something we still did not know.
 
Episode 04
[Hundreds of] years ago, according to documents of the [A.D.] era,
friends that you want to stay with forever...
were called called "BFFs".
It's a somewhat interesting word, and I liked it.
The three of us are best friends forever.
Even now,
I feel like they're right here beside me.
 
Episode 05
The Shinju-sama is god itself.
Therefore, I prayed.
To never be separated from my friends.
In a sense, that was something that would continue to be granted to me.
In exchange for the death of our comrade, we gained [immortal bodies].
 
Episode 06
-Beginning-
It was [after a while] that I learned [the truth].
In the past, it wasn't [a virus] that tormented [humanity], but [the Vertex].
And what started it all was [humanity], too.
I thought it was a bit similar to the story of the [Tower] of [Babel].
 
-Ending-
We were able to continue fighting by [offering] our bodies to the Shinju-sama.
"That is a very commendable thing…”
My parents said as they cried.
Wasshi...
No, you're [Tougou]-san now.
I’m glad you got off better than I did.
