Oversensitive Aubrey

>It all began when Sunny touched Aubrey.
>He just started visiting Faraway again, and Aubrey was the first to see him.
>Sunny's a fair bit better, thanks to some therapy he went through.
>He greets her with a small smile and attempts to hug her.
>But as his hands brushed past her arms, her eyes widened, and she suddenly went still.
>Something bubbled up inside her. Something.... surprisingly nice.
>Sunny noticed, but he took it as an issue, and backed off with an apology.
>Aubrey recovered and waved it off as fast as she could, determined to not ruin this reunion.
>But even as they talked, that passing sensation still lingered in her mind.
>She had an idea of what she felt. Hell, she knew she was giddy to see and talk with Sunny again.
>But that didn't tell her why that fleeting touch had such an effect on her.
>Not when she can hug everyone else and not even begin to feel like that.
>She tries to brush it off, though. Even if she tries not to be touchy with Sunny, she still wants to be around him.

>Some time passes.
>Sunny visits semi-frequently, and she always makes time for those occasions.
>Everyone picks up on it quickly, and she gets massive amounts of teasing before long.
>Aubrey tried to stonewall it, but she ultimately confronts her feelings and finds her infatuation for Sunny.
>It's not too long before she buckles and asks him on a date to Gino's.
>It goes rather well, with special thanks to Basil for running interference against Kel.
>They leave in high spirits and a warm atmosphere.
>Emboldened by this success, Aubrey tries to hold Sunny's hand.
>As she grasps his palm, that feeling emerges once more.
>She takes a moment of pause to process it, to feel it out in her mind.
>Yet even when she tries to take it slowly, Sunny decides to respond by closing his fingers around her hand.
>Her heart skips a bit, and she takes a sharp breath as soothing static hums from her palm.
>She can't help but blush as elusive sparks dance up her arm and spread throughout, coaxing and stimulating all at once.
>Part of her can't help but want to drown in this new sensation.
>But she's snapped out of her state when Sunny nudges her, asking what's wrong.
>"N-Nothing!" Aubrey blurts out. "I-I was just surprised....!"
>Sunny isn't very convinced, and asks if she wants him to free her hand.
>But she immediately tells him not to.
>It's.... not a feeling she's used to, or keen on wearing in public.
>But she wants to hold hands with her crush, and ultimately, she isn't against what he's unknowingly doing to her.
>She ends up pulling him a bit before they resume their walk away from the shopping plaza.

>Shortly after, Sunny and Aubrey go steady.
>Almost everyone is congratulating them, topped off with Kim's exasperated 'FINALLY!!'
>The Maverick isn't too pleased, but Aubrey doesn't really care.
>Bebe found the courage to sweep him up from his moping anyways.
>Aubrey's happy with Sunny, and vice versa, but their contact never goes beyond handholding for a while.
>As it turns out, that feeling Aubrey got from the first time? It keep coming back.
>Even if they've only done it for a week or two, it hasn't diminished at all.
>In fact, she doesn't even get the chance to get used to it before the next step occurs.
>Because one day, Sunny had the utterly criminal thought to surprise her with a hug.
>Aubrey was completely unprepared for not only his arms wrapping around her, but also the jolt that coursed from head to toe.
>Her face lit up brighter than a tomato as she squeaked, falling victim to the pleasing surges within.
>If she had any doubts about what she felt, they were immediately drowned within the ecstatic hums.
>Sunny took a bit to recognize that something was going on with Aubrey, but once he did, he quickly pulled off and tried to apologize.
>Only for Aubrey to suddenly latch onto him.
>"I-I didn't tell you to let go....!"
>Sunny was a bit confused, but he slowly wrapped his arms around her once more.
>Then she was trying not to breathe so heavily, and he became even more confused.
>But Aubrey refused to elaborate, and so the boyfriend was left in the dark with a clingy, overthrilled girlfriend.

>Life continues, but the incidents linger heavily upon Aubrey.
>They hold hands and hug now, but the feelings are still there, ever persistent, ever tempting.
>....And, eventually, Aubrey asked Sunny:
>"C-Can I kiss you?"
>It was not something she asked lightly, given her history.
>Of course, she never explained herself to Sunny, so he was rightly confused over her behavior.
>But, after a brief stint of awkward silence and averted gazes, he agreed.
>It started with a slow embrace.
>Her form buzzed as they looked each other in the eye.
>Sunny gathered his courage, and Aubrey tried to steady herself.
>They inched their faces together at a pace that agonized her.
>But they would come oh so close, and Aubrey braces herself for impact.
>Their lips connect for the briefest moment, but it was more than enough.
>Aubrey is immediately invaded by an overwhelming rapture, far more intense than anything their contact dealt before.
>It's far too much, and even though their kiss just ended, she immediately succumbs and erupts.
>Aubrey cries out and falls forward onto Sunny, who barely remains standing.
>She whimpers his name into his shoulder, shivering and squirming.
>He's halfway to a panic, calling her name and trying to comfort her.
>But even his well-meaning touch just adds onto her experience.
>It takes a minute before she can even begin to collect herself.
>"I.... I love you, Sunny...." Aubrey mumbles into his shirt, only halfway cognizant.
>Sunny, on the other hand, nearly throws his hands into the air.
>He gives up the ghost and asks her, impatiently, what's going on.
>If it was just a minute later, she might've clammed up or tried to make an excuse.
>But at this moment.... Well, Sunny is sharp enough to figure out what she's getting at.
>She's at least thankful that he didn't tease her on it afterwards.
