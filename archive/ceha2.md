#Detective Anon and the Werewolf: A love Story

->Chapter One: An Intimate Interview<-


Detective Anon marches down the long beige corridor to the keep where their "special" criminal, is currently locked and chained inside. Main suspect is a Mr. Rory Heart. Charged with three accounts of murder, all within the same pub with few eyewitnesses saying he, "transformed like that, and went crazy!". After four long weeks of tracking and chasing, Detective Anon had finally pinned him down at an old lumber warehouse and finally captured his suspect. Deputy Nancie and young officer Erik are walking alongside Anon in the same corridor, both very tense.

"Anon" spoke Nancie as they all continued to stride forward "This is very, very unsafe, you NEED at least eight guards to protect you. It's regulation! This isn't some petty criminal, you can't go in there alone!" she exclaimed, sending a chill down young Erik hoping Anon might change his mind.
"I'll be fine. I know what I'm doing" said Anon nonchalant, "You did have your men triple his restraints like I asked?"
"Yes" said Nancie "But Anon-"
They all stopped. They've reached the end of the hallway. All that stands between our simple officers and the nocturnal beast is a heavy metal door. Anon turns around.
"I don't want any interruptions, unless it's absolutely necessary. I have to be alone with him, he'll know if I'm not." Anon said making eye contact with both of them, then turns to the door, "Our little werewolf is expecting me." and then Anon opens the heavy door, disappears into the swallowing darkness while the door closes slowly and softly.
"Little, is a goddamn understatement" Nancie said loathingly.

All this trouble was about to pay off. I've met other werewolves sure, but not on the job, not like this. Anon was a fierce and intuitive detective, barely being in the force for less than two years and he's solving crimes left and right. Anon's heart is pounding. His shoes echo in the large chamber and a furry ear perks up to listen. He's here, and he's alone, he thought. Finally. They both were now face to face.

Anon approaches the chained werewolf. He was a sight to behold. Rory was hulking, even for werewolf standards. His jet black fur glistened from the hanging light, like stars, yet it couldn't hide his powerful muscles. With immense shoulders, and a proud, dark mane. Great for cuddling. Massive arms and biceps, to keep you safe. His giant chest straining and flexing because of his arms chained behind his back, yet his pecs were still full and heavy. Perfect for sucking and massaging. And huge tree trunk legs to support it all. Those needed worshipping. And of course, he is naked. Transforming will do that, especially if you're being chased and cornered, and then the light of the full moon hits you. His erect cock, as long as half of Anon's leg and thicker than both his arms together.
It's throbbing. Powerful. Leaking...
I want it.
I need it.
Give.
It.

But back to regulation, Anon stared into Rory's yellow eyes, and had to ask.
"I know you can break those chains easily." said Anon "So why haven't you? What is it you're waiting for?"
Anon was deeply anticipating to what the massive werewolf will say. Rory gave him a wolfish grin. His thick, fangs look so fierce and powerful. If only I could stroke them. Feel them against my skin. Anon did not know about Rory being in heat. All Rory wanted.. is to breed his next pup.
"I was waiting" he said "For my next pack mate!"
{CRACK!!}
The chains were ripped apart as easily as tearing paper! Rory lunged full throttle, like a beast about to catch his prey. He caught Anon's right arm before he could do anything, and now he was pinned to the ground. Rory seemed even bigger as he loomed over. His chest expanding with each huge breath. His huge claws on top Anon's arms, so fucking heavy, that he barely squirm his own hands. He reeked heavily of fresh soil and testosterone. God, it's so strong. Fuck! It's.. so.. good! God he's so... strong...

Rory's huge werewolf cock was right on top Anon, throbbing and leaking so much pre that it was soaking his clothes. At this point all Anon wanted was Rory's cock.
"Give it to me" he said softly "Force it, I don't care, I want it!"
It was a huge turn on for Rory, and so he let go of Anon's arms and Rory leaned forward, his tip so close, so big. Without a second thought, Anon quickly took hold of Rory's cock and shoved it as far he could. He wanted as much as his mouth could let him. Rory let out a hoarse, beastly moan.
"God this is all I ever wanted" Anon thought to himself.
It was Anon's dirty dream to please a big werewolf. He got what he wanted and more. Hoping to please himself and Rory as much as he wanted, Anon tried to swallow enough pre to make him feel full. Then when he got too full he began to lick and stroke Rory's dick.
"What's wrong pup?" said Rory looking down.
"Full of {burp} pre" Anon said, and as the idea of burping from drinking enough werewolf spunk got him even more hard, he felt Rory's claws grasp him.
"Not full enough!" Rory exclaimed.
{RIIIPP}
He tore Anon's pants off and laid him on the ground face first. Rory then leans very close so that his and Anon's face were next to each other, wraps his his huge arms around him, and then puts all his weight on top of Anon except for his legs. His big, soft pecs pressed against back. He's so fucking fluffy.
Between Rory's beastly breathing, his chest pressed on him, wrapped in his arms, there was nothing left but to have werewolf dick inside him.
"How much do you want it?" said Rory with his huge wolfish grin, hoping to hear what he wants to hear.
"Please.. god.." said Anon in anticipation "I want all of it!"
Anon felt his tip and next thing, Rory was slamming his mighty werewolf cock inside of Anon. Anon moaned as he clung to Rory's fur. Rory face was tight and barred his fangs. A real, dominant Alpha. There was no need for speed or technique. The feeling of Rory's huge cock and Anon's small frame and tight ass was all they needed. It was absolute heaven.

Rory suddenly exhaled faster and Anon could feel that the climax coming yet he wished this could go on forever. Rory went a little faster and then a little harder. More... More... MORE!!
"Fill me up!!" exclaimed Anon.
"AAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!" howled Rory!
Anon could feel Rory's seed filling him up and up. If he could see his belly, it would definitely be round from all the werewolf cum. As much as he wanted more (and hopefully some after sex cuddling), his vision started to go darker and darker. What's happening? I'm still...
Everything was faint now and the last thing Anon felt was that he was being picked up... and then carried. Then nothing.
