The Hormoning Ch. 4: He deserves a break.

“I AM KNOWLEDGE, DIA HIGHEST DEATH THIRTEEN DAINA ART OF IMPACT-!”

You weren’t paying much attention to her. Everything happening around you shut off most of your senses, the lights, the sounds, everything. It wasn’t until the little girl finished her introduction that the chaos around you ceased.

“OF DARKNESS, LAPLUS!” She seemed proud of herself, and waited patiently for your response. There’s a ringing in your ear.

“Eh, so, Dia Higher… can I just call you Laplus?”

“So disrespectful!” She pouted.

“I doubt it matters, this is just a dream.”

“This is no dream, mortal.” Laplus told you. “I’ve transported your consciousness to a different plain of existence.”

“What?”

Laplus smirked. Her high and might voice returned alongside her exaggerated mannerisms. 

“Yes! I have come to tell you about your destiny.”

For some reason, as insane as it was to listen to what looked like a ten-year-old doing some weird cosplay, you felt your chest getting heavier. A sense of danger, perhaps this wasn’t a dream, but a nightmare. 

“The land of sunrise is in dire need of a savior. You shall be that savior. It was foretold that the last pure man amidst the chaos would be the one to stop the havoc brought by the deal sealed in blood.”

Only a handful of words that came out of Laplus’ mouth made sense to you, and those that did, told you that you were a virgin.

You wanted to answer your doubts, the problem was that you didn’t understand what you didn’t understand. You couldn’t organize a single thought inside your head. Laplus looked are your confused self, and resumed eating the chicken that was brought over.

In the midst of the storm that was your head right now, you managed to ask one thing.

“How the hell did the chicken made it over to another plane of existence?”

“That is…” Laplus was still eating. “Because-“ She coughed onto her sleeve. “It’s a rule I set. The last time I did this, humans came through without anything from their world. And I…”

The color from Laplus’ face suddenly drained.. 

“Something the matter?” You asked her. You heard how she muttered something.

“…dick.”

“What?”

“Old wrinkly dick.”

You had no idea what she was trying to say at first, but it sure as fuck wasn’t that.

“What the fuck.” You managed to spurt out.

“The last man who came through was naked. It was my first ever…” Laplus seemed horrified. “I didn’t know that- I saw everything…” 

Laplus still didn’t come to her senses. For a godlike being, she sure was innocent. Your hand came over her back and gently pet her. Her body was shivering. Another gentle pat and she began to calm down. 

“I-I’ll explain next time, I need a moment.”

She snapped her fingers, and so, you woke up in your bed. Laplus’ image began slowly fading from your mind. Soon you forgot everything.

~*~

Another dull day goes by. 

Clocking out of work and finally picking up your phone you saw a text message from an unknown number. Anxiety began rising in you as you read it. 

“Hey its your cab im not gonna make it so ur gonna need a different one”

“Sorry” Said the next text.

Fucking great. Just a few hours away from the next cycle too. You could go back up and ask Mrs. Lui to get you another one, but your instincts told you that was the worst course of action. For all you knew Lui would offer you to drive you home herself, and suddenly, you’d get raped in the backseat of her car. Many used to fantasize about fucking their bosses, in your case, you didn’t want to know what Lui was capable of under the effects of the Hormoning. 

It was unlikely that you could get a taxi at this time, the ones who do take the risk of working charge outrageous fares. No bus either after the incident. Sprinting back home wasn’t so tempting after everything that happened last time.

There was just one option left, though. You fidgeted with your phone. As your fingers opened her chat, you prayed she'd say yes.

~*~

Botan drove you in an old Nissan V16. Still painted black, still with the white striped she loved so much and a fair amount of tuning. 

“What happened to your Camaro?” You asked her.

“I’m laying low for a while.” She replied bluntly. “This one was my first love, though, now I have a reason to take it out for a ride once more.”

A short silence stood between you two. Botan seemed stiff. You felt the need to say something.

“Sorry to bother you with this.” 

“I did promise I’d lend you a hand.” 

Once more, the cheerful and playful Botan you knew was nowhere to be seen. 

She stopped at a red light before an avenue. A red Ford stood beside her. The driver revved up his engine. Botan knew what he wanted. A showoff on a Mustang. She looked forward to the road, her eyes lit up, and she got an idea.

Seeing her grin, you swallowed as Botan revved her engine too in response to the Ford’s challenge. The hairs in your body became stiff, your hand became shaky.

“B-Botan?” 

“Don’t worry Anon.” She said. “Just sit there and look.”

Panic took over your body. You weren’t a huge fan of adrenaline to say the least. 

“Botan please!”

The Ford’s engine kept teasing Botan. The pedestrian streetlight was beginning to flash. Botan licked her lips waiting for the right moment, and as soon as the light turned green, the Ford took off in the blink of an eye.

And Botan drove normally, watching calmly as her challenger drove recklessly on the street. Before you could ask anything, Botan pointed at a black car with her finger.

Everything clicked when you saw red and blue lights.

And so, a police chase ensued.

Botan stifled a giggle, and then began laughing uncontrollably. You just realized what she did. 

“That was so mean, Botan!”

“I just really hate cocky dudes who think they’re hot shit because they drive nice cars, that’s all.”

She was still laughing, and before you knew it, you were laughing too.

This was the Botan you knew. She looks so good with a smile in her face. 

“Your laugh is really contagious.” You said without thinking, before blushing at your own words.

“Oh really? Thanks.” Botan replied bluntly. She hid her smile as best she could. 

~*~

“Call me whenever you need to, alright?”

“Thanks again, I’ll send you some money for the gas.”

“Don’t.” She replied. “I’ll come this week for the samples, have them ready.”

“Right.”

Botan waved at you and waited for you to enter your apartment, seeing you go up the stairs one by one. A bell began ringing from the building, and you sped up. Botan noticed you rushing to your apartment and entering in a hurry.

A loud clicking noise was heard. Botan figures that was the remote lock that the managers used. However, she noticed one small problem, Botan could see your door from where she stood, and it was still open. 

She kept her eyes on it for a bit more. You still didn’t close it. Shrugging it off, she put on her seatbelt and grabbed the car key. The little remark you made about her laugh came back to her. The old Nissan turned it's engine on.

Looking once more at the building, she couldn’t see your door from the car.

Back in your place, you left your stuff in the bed and collapsed next to it. Your phone began ringing. It was Botan, you put her on the speaker.

“Hey.”

“Lock your doors.”

“Oh, the apartment’s system already-“

“Your front door is open.”

“What?!”

Botan heard a thump, then some hurried steps, and finally the sound of a creaking door and a lock. Then it was unlocked, and locked again.

“Thank you so much!” You said in bathed breath.

“Take care of yourself, you dumbass.” Botan smiled. 

Before you could say anything else, she hung up.

~*~

How long has it been since then? A month? A little more? It had been a while before you knew Botan or Koyori, so probably a month and a half.

Like any other day, you were coming back to home. To a place you used to call home, up until then at least. She would be watching TV, or browsing her phone, in the shower, doing whatever. You went up the stairs and reached for your keys. The apartment was dark. 

“I’m home.” You told the darkness. No response.

You headed for the bathroom and sat on the toilet. As you calmed your bodily needs, you noticed a rhythmic sound coming from the bedroom. A cold shiver went down your spine.

Surely she must be touching herself, that must be it. After all, she’s asymptomatic, she told you so. You spent a while on the toilet doing nothing. It was the equivalent of shutting your ears and pretending you didn’t listen. A feeling of unease began taking over you.

Finally you got up and stood before the door.

The rhythmic thumps were accompanied by soft moans. The bedframe was hitting the wall.

You swallowed. A tear was ready to come out of your eye at a moment’s notice. Your hand felt shaky on the doorknob, and after you twisted it and pushed.

No surprises.

~*~

Now that very same hand was holding onto a glass full of boxed wine. No one survives on bread and water. Much less when going through tough times.

Wasted out of your mind, you heard someone knocking on the door. Clumsily you tried to get on your feet, and almost fell over as you did. The person at the door was getting impatient. Your feet felt heavy, your throat desperately needed some water. 

Finally you opened, and saw Botan greeting you with a smile, before noticing your highly intoxicated state.

“Heey! Bottun!” You tried to learn on your arm against your doorframe like some movie jock trying to look cool. You smiled at Botan, her figure slowly became angled. As your face began falling onto the floor, you realized you missed your doorframe. Botan helped you get back on your feet.

“What’s wrong with you? It’s Tuesday!”

No intelligent reply was heard from your mouth. Botan brought your arm over her shoulder and walked you inside, she left you on your bed as incomprehensible babbling exited your mouth. She looked around the room, and noticed it was dirtier than the last time she was there. One thing in particular caught her attention, the packs of cigarettes by your bed.

“I didn’t know you smoked, Anon.”

“Uh? Oh, nonono, I don’t. Those are my girl- my ex-girlfriend’s. I just, happened to buy her a pack when we…”

Everything clicked for Botan. Alcohol and heartbreak go like bread and butter. She thought of telling you the same piece of advice she gave Coco, but stopped herself from generalizing everything. Botan saw your half-empty glass of wine and the box it came from. 

“Oh s-sorry! D’ya want a drink?” You asked her.

“No thanks, I’m driving.”

“That’s fine…” You said as you downed the wine left in the glass in one go, and began pouring another. Botan took the box from your hand.

“I think you’ve had enough.”

“I can drink as much as I want.”

“Maybe, but you shouldn’t. You look like there’s more wine than blood in your veins.”

“I’m not that drunk!”

“Oh yeah? How many fingers am I holding up?” 

Botan stuck out her hand to you. Before you could answer, she flicked her index on your forehead.

“Gotcha!” Botan smirked. Your lackluster reaction robbed her of her enjoyment.

Instead of your usual outraged response, there was nothing but silence.

Botan could tell you weren’t at your best. Behind the meek Anon she knew was someone who needed to cry. 

“What happened with her?” She spoke.

You remained silent. She could see in your expression you had been bottling up your feelings.

“We knew each other for a long time. It was before this entire shitshow.”

Botan sat by the bed and listened.

“She told me she was asymptomatic.” Your eyes closed involuntarily. “But that was a lie. Honestly, it’s not about getting cheated that I hate so much. Well, it is, but, I feel more hurt that after all the time we spent together she…. She wouldn’t tell me the truth, y’know.”

You let out a sniffle, Botan shyly caressed your head.

“She kept me around because…. I don’t know, money? The powerplay? I know it’s not the time to be sentimental but that doesn’t stop me from being angry about it.” 

Botan brought your head over your pillow and sat by your side. Her hand kept comforting you with strange movements. She wasn’t used to doing this apparently.

“I just wanted someone to love me.” You said in defeat. “That’s why I kept telling myself it wasn’t happening.”

“You can still try to love, Anon.” Botan smiled. You turned to her with an incredulous look.

“That’s fucking bullshit, Botan. There is no place for love when everyone behaves like an animal. I don’t want to get used like a sex toy, I want someone to…to share, to enjoy things with, I want to hold someone in my arms and feel that…” Before you could speak again, a knot in your throat began forming. You turned onto your back and looked at the ceiling. “I don’t think anyone would look at me that way either.”

“Oh come on now, now you’re just willingly drowning in your pitty.” Botan said. She looked around your apartment. The shelves had visible amounts of dust on them. 

“That’s easy for you to say, how many girls want to be with a boring office worker? Someone like you wouldn’t understand.”

Botan’s eyes showed confusion and displeasure. 

“What do you mean “someone like me”?” 

“Someone who is charming like you.” 

Botan was taken aback. Was it the alcohol speaking? Your comment caught her off guard in more ways than one. Her look was lost in the distance. 

A clock’s ticking and the buzzing of your bedroom lights was the only audible sound in the room, before you let out a sniffle. Botan was unsure of what to do, so she tried something she read somewhere. “He’s too drunk to remember anyways, right?” She hoped.

Gently taking your head into her hands, she placed it onto her thighs. You were surprised, but not displeased, Botan’s legs were firm, yet soft. You could tell most of it was lean muscle. Her hand came over your head once more. It feels so nice to be held…

“I’m not one to really give love advice, you know? I’m not that good at relationships myself. Guys find me too cold or snarky at times. And well, nowadays it’s impossible to have a serious relationship-“

“Told ya.” You said as you calmed down.

“Oh shut up.” She flicked her finger on your forehead again.

“Ah!”

“Now that’s more like it!” She giggled. The mood of the room had finally let up. “ You know… I’ve felt that it’s hard to make bonds with others either way, I myself-” 

You vision began to blurry. Botan kept monologuing, but you weren’t listening. A certain heat began forming in your throat. 

“Mmm!”  

Botan snapped out of monologue and realized you were about to throw up.

“Shit! Where’s your bathroom?!”

Botan brought your arm over her shoulder again and headed for the first door she saw. She knelt you before the toilet and lifted the lid. Now she rubbed your back. 

You can’t hold it in anymore.

The red liquid emerged from your mouth and onto the toilet. It looked like you were puking your organs out. Botan kept caressing your back and you kept regurgitating everything that had gone inside before she was here.

“I-I’m sorry, I’m fine now…”

“It’s alright, keep going.”

Your gagged, but nothing was coming out. Botan slapped your back gently, finally you let out what was left.  

Botan flushed the toilet and then walked you to your bed.

“You got Gatorade?”

“No…just…water…”

Botan headed for your kitchen and brought you a jar of water.

“You’re hopeless, you know that?”

“Thanks, Botan.”

She sighed. “Don’t mention it.” She’s heard you say that so many times now, she began smiling when she heard it. 

“No, I mean, thanks for listening.”

Her ears perked up.

Botan brought your head over your pillow once more, and then brought your bed covers over your body, she then remembered the reason of her visit.

“Anon, where are the samples?” 

“Black plastic bag, under the bed.”

You seemed too tired to keep going.

Botan reached for the bag and turned off the lights. She looked for your keys and locked the door as she left before sliding them under the door.

~*~

Back at her place, Botan was getting her new toy ready. Pellets soaked in the sedative that Koyori had prepared, carefully being handled with gloves and loaded onto the magazine she had customized herself for Coco’s gun. She checked that everything moved as it should. 

As focused as she was in the task at hand, a sudden thought crossed her mind while she looked outside the window. From here she could see District B. It becomes very colorful at night. The nightclubs, the host clubs, the motels and the bars with their usual customers. Her eyes lingered on the view for a little longer, she was lost in thought.
  
Her eyebrows perked up, she brought her phone out and called Koyori.

“Botan?” 

“Koyo-chan, I need to ask you a favor.”

“Yes?”

“There’s something I want you to try to do.”

~*~

A few days after, you asked for a three-week vacation from your boss. She couldn’t protest, given you hadn’t taken them the years prior. Normally you’d spend your time at home, doing whatever, but now, you were doing something else. 

Koyori texted you one morning thanking you for the samples and making some small talk about daily life. Her motives were a mystery, one you were terrified of finding out.

“You know, I think it’s time I pay you for all your help.” 

You didn’t reply at first. Whatever deranged idea she had thought up as your reward was probably going to kill you.

“If you come to the lab, and let me run a few tests, I might find a way to revert your infertility.”

Your eyes lit up.

~*~

The subway was crowded beyond belief. There was barely any space to move. You tried your best to not brush too much on the people around you. Your phone buzzed. With some difficulty you pulled it out of your pocket. Botan sent you a text message.

“Are you ready?”

“I’m on the subway.” You typed with one finger.

“What? I was going to pick you up.”

“Just come get me at the station outside the district.”

“I’m going to kill you when I see you.”

You smiled.

You tried putting your phone back in. The train stopped and more people got in. Now it was impossible to move, you got pushed towards the wall.  Thankfully in two more stations that connected to the more concurred lines you’d get your chance to breathe. 

Suddenly, you felt something soft brush up against your pelvis.

An office lady with red hair was standing in front of you, and her ass was pressed against you. You thought at first that it wasn’t her intention to, since the train was fully packed, but as her butt swayed from side to side, you understood.

“Oh fuck…” You thought.

You’ve been in this situation before. Estimates believe that a total of 89% of the male population in Japan has been molested at some point in public transport. You weren’t on the 11%. From high schoolers to office workers, from essential workers to lawyers, most men had been touched in some way or the other by women.

You felt her hand on your hip, she placed it between her butt and your penis, and carefully tried to reach for your crotch. You looked in the distance to distract yourself and began counting from 1 to 100. Soon enough this will pass. As you approached 20, she was still struggling to unzip your pants. Her hand was in the zipper, but she was pulling in the wrong direction. She turned ever so slightly to try and see what she’s doing wrong. She’s nervous, her eyes gleam with insecurity. Taken aback by her incompetence, your fear passed to make way for pity. 

You sighed.

Your hand locked itself around her wrist, she jumped and turned to you.

“Shh.” You scolded her.

She heard your pants being unzipped by yourself and you grunted. Soon her hand was digging itself inside.

“There.” You thought. “The sooner she gets what she wants, the sooner this will be over.”

Except it wasn’t even close to ending. Her hand was floating about in your pants, as if scared of touching your penis. A molester’s supposed to make you uncomfortable, not mad at how bad she is at it. The more her hand played around your pubes, the more you wanted her to go through with it. Your displeasure manifested itself in an audible grunt that shook the girl.

Her fingers walked one by one down your boxers, then slowly slid around your cock, by her movements, you figured she was stunned at your size. She’s squeezed gently.

The train stopped. The amount of people inside didn’t change in any noticeable way.

Now she’s stroking you over your underwear. You can see half of her grin, looking at you as if trying to overpower you, all she was met with was your disappointed stare. Now her hand cusped your cock and balls, closing in towards you.

Finally, the train reached the common station. Most people got off to get on their platforms.

The girl quickly took off her hand and you zipped your pants back up.

You could see her reflection on the window, looking at the hand she touched you with. She faked a cough onto it and to your disgust, you noticed she sniffed it, giving her a look of satisfaction.

You arrived at your station. Only a handful of people got off here. You were greeted by a decrepit station with cracks in the walls and graffiti all over. Bringing your phone out, you told Botan you were waiting for her. Seen, but no response. Probably on her way.

The red haired girl was standing beside you, looking at you with a lewd smugness. Her left hand supported her right arm, as her other hand caressed her own cheek.

She approached you with a sexy strut, slowly, one leg in front of the other. Her legs were amazing however, no denying that. Her heels made a loud clatter on the platform, her smug smile growing bigger by the second. 

The reaction you could muster up for her was a disappointed glare.

“You call *that* molesting someone? It felt like I was touching myself with an anesthetized hand.”

Her eyes jumped and she tried to hide in her shoulders. Her confidence plummeted. Now she fidgeted with her fingers and avoided looking at you in the eyes. You sighed once more and turned around to leave. After everything you’ve been through, she was like child’s play. 

You went up the stairs to exit the station, as you felt her tugging your shirt. You turned around and saw her looking at the floor in defeat.

“Huh?”

“P-Please teach me how to molest someone!”

She promptly got into a dogeza pose, her body shaking in embarrassment.

“I, oh. Um, well, you can just google…pre Hormoning doujinshi? Reverse the roles? And well, you have to actually go through with it, not just fumble around…”

"Wait, why am I teaching her how to molest people?" You thought.

“Make sure to practice?” You told her. 

She asserted with her head.

“I’ll do my best!” And with that, she ran off.

After she was out of your sight, you were dumbfounded at your attitude. It’s one thing to get molested, but you were surprised that *you* managed to stick it up to her. It was something that…

“That Botan would’ve done, isn’t it?” You thought. Perhaps she’s rubbed off on you a bit. 

You felt a slim finger in your collarbone, your body paralyzed in fear. A fingernail slowly drew a line down the middle of your back, now two nails scratched slightly your shirt. Your legs were shaky, your breathing became more worked up, suddenly you regretted coming here by yourself instead of letting Botan pick you up.

Too scared to turn around, you felt how someone came closer to you, and suddenly…

She blew in your ear, causing you to shiver and shriek, almost falling down in a panic.

“Eek!” You squealed, turning to face your aggressor in a panic, and all you saw was Botan’s cheek holding back her giggles.

“Guess I was wrong~”

“B-Botan! Why didn’t you tell me you- Why did you- What was that about?”

“Oh, nothing, I saw you say something to that girl and I couldn’t believe my eyes…” Her palm covered her mouth. “I was just wondering when you grew a spine.” 

You blushed and glared back at her. Botan laughed.

“Come on, my cars outside.”

You said nothing, while she kept pestering you with her smug aura. Once you two were out on the street, she opened the car door just to piss you off even more.

You put the seatbelt on. Botan checked her rearview mirrors before taking off. She turned to you.

“Are you excited?”

Your hands impatiently tapped your thighs. A slight smile drew over your face. 

“Yes.”

~*~

You lied on the same bed that you had once waken up in. Koyori went over what she was capable of doing, what she'd try, and how you had to cooperate.

“But!” Koyori said as she took a sample of your blood. “The catch is that I won’t work on this until I’ve made progress on the cure for the hormoning. Don’t expect it to happen overnight either.

“Got it.”

“And of course, since I need to test a few more things regarding your physiology, I’m going to need you to come here daily.”

“Daily?”

“Mhm!” 

“Koyori…” You fumed. “This wasn’t just an elaborate prank so you could use me as a lab rat again, was it?”

“I did consider pulling your heart strings to get you to come here, but Botan talked me out of it.” Koyori wrote down some stuff on a clipboard.  

“You did…”

“Yes, the end justifies the means of course! But, I’m really doing this for you.”

“Why?”

“It’s the just thing to do!” She turned to you and met your incredulous glare.

“Since when does your moral compass work?”

Koyori giggled to herself.

“I’ll be willing to help you, but I need to know why.” You told her.

Koyori sighed mentally. Lies have never been her trade.

“The truth is, Botan asked me to.”

You brought yourself up from the bed, just as shocked as you were the first time you woke up in it. You heard the clanking of some vials Koyori was playing with. 

No words. No questions asked. 

“Shouldn’t you be working in a proper lab anyways?” You asked Koyori once your mind stopped drawing blanks.

Koyori’s ears perked up, and she turned to you with anger.

“What’s “improper” about my lab?”

“Sorry, sorry, I meant, shouldn’t you be working with the government? O-Or are you already?”

Koyori turned back to her vials. 

“I’m going to need a fresh sperm sample Anon, you know what that means.”

You remained silent.

Koyori sighed.

“I did work with some pretty big teams during the first year. We worked around the cycles without much problem, but truthfully, we didn’t make any significant progress. Eventually the funding towards the project died out, and we were left scattered about.” 

Koyori put down the clipboard, she walked around the room looking all the little details on the walls and the floor, from the cracks to the bits of chipped paint.

“I did join different groups later on, but, history repeated itself. Eventually I received a red letter on my mail that read: “For everyone’s safety, stand back.” I figured someone wanted us out, and that’s how I ended up here.”

She sat beside you.

“I want things to go back to normal. My collegaues, my friends, so many of them, everything was so sudden. Their lives, their careers, their relationships, all of it. I don’t like doing the things I do when the cycles happen either.”

You listened to her tale with great interest. More questions popped inside your head.

“How did you get this lab, then?”

“Oh, I just took over it when the original pharmacy closed. Did some readjustments here and there.”

“And how do you keep it running then?”

Closing one eye, Koyori pointed a finger gun at your leg and fired.

“Bang!” She let out as you stared at her in confusion.

“I make tranquilizers, like the ones Botan uses, and the one you shot yourself with.” She said with some snark. “She finds me steady buyers and supplies them with my special bullets. She knows a handful of people from around the district, so she knows who wants what.”

You stared in awe. Koyori enjoyed your reaction.

 “That’s how we run our little business! All towards the goal of ending this apocalypse.”

Koyori got up from the bed and picked up her stuff. After that, she searched for something in one of her pockets.

“Anon.”

“Yeah?”

She tossed a condom at you.

“I need that sample.”

You sighed.

“Sure.”
