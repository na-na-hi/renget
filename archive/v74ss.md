#Summer Festival

#####I. Sunday - Dai-Ichi Ikkai Compound

Inigo focused on the flickering light of the traditional paper lanterns hanging from the ceiling. The scent of aged wood and incense filled the air of the Dai-Ichi Ikkai training hall. The cold wooden floors, worn smooth by countless years of disciplined training, were now stained with his sweat and blood. 

Inigo struggled to stand, as three of his brother's yakuza surrounded him and took turns swinging tetsubos.  One by one, their iron-studded clubs struck him. The ritualistic oils that covered him amplified each blow. A sharp ringing filled his head. Inigo could feel Gigan trying to escape the cage they'd put it in. Inigo fell from a blow, but he staggered back to his feet and smiled.

"You know... If you just wanted-"  A heavy blow landed on his stomach.

"-to beat the shit out of me. I cou-" Another struck him from the back.

"introduce you to-" A solid strike lacerated his chest. Blood splattered.

"-the girls in my class." Heavy metal studs collided with his lower ribs, and his vision blurred from the sharp pain shooting through him. He fell to the ground; vomiting blood and bile. His body shook involuntarily on the floor as he curled into a fetal position. The three men stopped their assault. Inigo felt the floor vibrate as his eldest brother, Satoru, walked out from his place in the shadows. 

"Joke all you want, brother. But that school has made you weak and pathetic." He looked down on Inigo with disdain, arms crossed over the large dragon tattoo on his chest. 

"Your sad excuse for a dragon has coddled you and made you soft. You've lost your scales." He looked up at one of the clan's shamans standing on a wooden platform. The shaman rang a small bell, and two identical-looking old women, wearing priestly hoods, entered the room. They were frail, and their skin drooped from their bones as they used their healing quirk on the half-unconscious boy.

Inigo gritted his teeth as his lungs burned, the process that mended his bones was a torturous one. He opened one eye and focused it on the women tending to him. How many times have they repeated this process? How much more could they use their healing quirk? The elderly women looked like they were about to drop dead and collapse from exhaustion. He felt worried for them. "H.. hey Sato... Let's take a little break." Inigo gasped sharply as his ribs mended, his lungs expanded.

"Giving up already? I'm disappointed, brother."

"Yeah.. like you said, I'm soft and pathetic. Just a few minutes. C'mon please."

"Don't beg. Dragons do not beg." *You should see Gigan at the grocery store.*  Inigo took in air, and sat up. He touched his chest. There wasn't a bruise on him, but his newly healed skin stung. With a wave of his hand, Sato dismissed all the servants in the room. 

"Dragons have new ideas too. What, you're just stealing all your training notes from Pops?" Inigo said as he staggered to his feet and reached for his water bottle in the corner.

"Our training has been handed down to us through four generations of-" 

Yada, yada, yada. Inigo had heard the same lines every Sunday for the last five months in Satoru's endless attempts at improving him and making him a proper emergency heir. He just wanted Sato to start the routine speech, so he could drink in peace. The spring water tasted like heaven. He took a moment to just breathe. Working lungs were something else. Just six more hours, and he'd be home again. He felt excited.

"-and it is up to us to preserve the legacy of the Dai-Ichi Ikkai," Sato finished. Damn, that was fast. Inigo placed the bottle down and checked his phone.
"Hey Sato. Is it cool if I leave early tonight?"

"Whatever for? We have guests, I assumed you'd stay the night."

"It's just that the Summer Festival is tomorrow. I wanted to borrow some clothes for it." Inigo smirked and gave his brother a boyish look. "I know you like festivals."

"Must I repeat my speech? Such petty frivolous things are beneath us, brother."

"Yeah, yeah, we're dragons and all that, but I kind of promised someone I'd be there. Dragons keep their word, right?"

"Yes, we do."

Inigo grinned. "Then let me leave early. You can have six guys with even bigger sticks next time to make up for it."

"You're going to regret saying that."

"Yeah, I probably will." Inigo watched Sato summon his men into the room. He put on his trademark grin.

*But not before I get to see Hoge in a yukata.*

It was one of the last sunny days of the summer, right before rainclouds came to replace the clear skies. Inigo flew above the Kyoto summer festival grounds and saw colorful stalls, just beginning to come to life. Stall owners and their assistants bustled about, diligently setting up their temporary shops, transforming the quiet streets into a tapestry of colors and shapes. The air was infused with the scent of freshly cut wood and the faint aroma of food being prepared for the day's festivities.

Inigo spotted Hifumi setting up one of the takoyaki stalls, before landing to say hello. 

"Hey Hifumi, what's up, man?" Inigo asked, cheerfully. 

"Yo. I'm raising this stall. We've got a good location for the festival this year." Hifumi replied as he stuck a wooden pole into the ground.

"Bro, you're right at the front. You're going to be busy! Busy making bank!" Inigo grabbed one of the signs and held it so Hifumi could hammer it into the stall.

"Yeah. I bet you'll get hungry after all the games. Come by and I'll slip you guys an extra piece."  He grabbed another board and started hammering it. "We got this new version with little pieces of frankfurters."

"That sounds so delicious, man. I'm going to hold you to that. Where do you want this?" Inigo held up two wooden poles. 

"Just set them over there. We got a new owner for the stall this year." Hifumi said as he tied a heavy rope to one of the poles. "We're setting up early to meet them."

"Sounds like a blast. I'll be rooting for your stall to dominate!" Inigo smirked.  "Speaking of domination, do you know if the Korean girls are coming to this thing? They haven't accepted my mass class invite."

"You know how they are with you. Hailey mentioned something about Max shooting a vlog here since the fireworks displays' been so hyped up!"

"Yo. It looks like Hailey's here, man. You should say hi, and I'm gonna zip. Call me if you need backup, bro." 

"Alright, later, man." Hifumi looks around. "That new owner should be arriving right about now too."

Inigo flew away and checked the Hivemind girls off his list of people who needed to be dragged to the Summer Festival. There are still two holdouts for a full class celebration. He had taken it upon himself to ensure that his fellow classmates wouldn't miss out. He had coordinated a few of his uncle's men, to carry out yukata distribution to those who didn't own one.

As he flew, Inigo surveyed the park, and noticed a familiar figure standing alone. It was Kaylee doing pull-ups near the school. Determined to understand why she had chosen to decline the festival, he landed gracefully near her.

"Yo Kaylee! Why aren't you coming to the festival?" He asked, his voice brimming with optimism.

Kaylee rubbed her arms and crossed them as she got off the bars.

"It's none of your business," she replied, her tone serious.

Unfazed, Inigo flashed a friendly smile. "Aw c'mon! Fine if you won't tell me, how bout we spar then?  It could be fun!" He looked around the area. "Plus, no one's around. Let's spar!"

The challenge piqued Kaylee's interest, and she nodded, a determined glint in her eyes.

"You asked for it!"

"Wait, hang on!" 

Kaylee was already building power as she flew above him, she was creating a large ball of ki.

Inigo activated his quirk, summoning a protective orb around himself. Layers of energy crackled with each layer of the barrier he created. Kaylee, channeling her immense strength, charged up her bomb and hurled it at Inigo's barrier.

As the impact reverberated, Inigo fell back. He had ten layers of barriers, and all of them were broken. He looked up and she was already charging another one.

"Wait wait! That was a good one. You got me!" he complimented.

Kaylee frowned and floated down. "You didn't last very long."

Inigo waved his hands in front of him. "Didn't think you were going to start off with that. "Are you mad at me about something?" he asked, genuine curiosity in his voice.

Kaylee, still frustrated with the short match, spoke loudly. "You said I was with Chris, something about breaking pelvises ring a bell?"

 "Oh, that? It was an honest mistake, really. I just wanted the best for Christopher, and you guys seemed chill together. You two are cool bros, maybe we could be friends too?" he explained.

Kaylee, distrustful and still angry, floated mid-air, eyeing Inigo cautiously. "I don't trust you. You're always up to something like with that bear."

"That's fair. How bout' a trial friend run then?" he suggested, hoping to break through her tough exterior. Inigo looked around the park. "You know most of the shops are closed because of the festival. I was going to get something to eat." He reached into his pack and extended a box of donuts towards Kaylee. "You want a donut?" he offered, a mischievous glint in his eyes.

Kaylee scoffed at the selection and took a jam-filled donut from the box and chewed on it.

"I can't help you with chess and I don't really want to spar right now, but I've got an idea. Have you ever been to a salon?" Inigo asked, grinning.

"Do you think I need one?" she replied, her tone guarded.

"No, no! It's just that I get my hair done monthly at this chill place. You want to come with me? Everything's closed anyway. C'mon, it'll be my treat," he explained.

"This better not be one of your games, Myoga," she warned, her voice still tinged with suspicion.

With their agreement in place, Inigo led Kaylee to Madam Goose's Salon, a hidden gem known for its vintage charm and enthusiastic staff of middle-aged women. The salon exuded a cozy atmosphere, with its wallpaper adorned with delicate floral patterns, vintage mirrors reflecting soft light, and plush chairs inviting relaxation. The air was filled with the soothing melodies of soft jazz music.

As the door swung open with their arrival, the staff recognized Inigo and greeted him with their usual cheerfulness, pinching his cheeks and ushering him to sit anywhere.

"Inigo! It's been a while! Who's this lovely lady with you?" Madam Goose exclaimed, her voice echoing through the salon. "Is this the Hoge we've been hearing about? You didn't tell us she was so tall!"

Inigo introduced Kaylee proudly. "No no! Ladies, this is Kaylee, one of my classmates in the Hero Course. She's with me today."

The salon attendants, intrigued by Kaylee's imposing presence, welcomed her with genuine smiles, their curiosity piqued as they surrounded her and peppered her with questions. Inigo was hoping Kaylee wouldn't fly into a rage, but she seemed to handle herself well. 

Settling into the comfortable salon chairs, Kaylee and Inigo surrendered themselves to the expert hands of the staff. The attendants washed their hair with fragrant shampoos, their skilled fingers massaging their scalps with care. Kaylee's formidable locks required the attention of three dedicated staff members, each taking turns with her hair.

"See, isn't this nice?" Inigo said as he was leaning back. The aroma of essential oils filled the air.

Kaylee wasn't talking much, and she simply kept her eyes closed. 

"So, Kaylee, how have you been doing? Why weren't you interested in going to the festival?" he inquired.

Kaylee, her face covered in a face mask, shrugged her broad shoulders.

"I'm training to get stronger. The festival is a waste of time for me," she responded.

"In case you didn't think anyone would want you there. I know I'd like to hang out with you more. We could even hang out with the Boys together."

"That doesn't matter to me."

"Yeah, I guess I was grasping a bit there." Inigo chuckled. "How do you like the place so far?"

"The stuff they use smells nice." Kaylee said.

"Right? It's the new Tatarimokke-Enchanté Revival Line." Inigo inhaled the botanical-based scent. "You know, if you ever want to come here yourself, you can. Just have them put it on my tab. The women here are nice to talk to, and I sometimes come here to vent. Of course, you could always come with me on my monthly runs too."

"I'll think about it. I'd rather go by myself if you're paying." Kaylee replied.

"Your hair looks good, by the way." Inigo grinned, giving her a thumbs-up.

Their conversation was interrupted when one of the salon attendants emerged from the back room, holding a plate of freshly baked cookies.

"Guess who has cookies? Just came out of the oven!" She moved with a smile towards them, when she suddenly tripped, causing her to fall forward. The plate collided with Kaylee, ruining her newly cleaned hair. With the same motion, the woman also sent her elbow upwards and struck Kaylee in the jaw.

Everyone in the room turned and looked on in shock for a moment. A growl reverberated from Kaylee as her eyes glowed with fury. She instinctively stood up and grabbed the woman by the throat, her anger building.

Inigo, alarmed and concerned, rushed forward and placed a hand on Kaylee's wrist. "Kaylee, stop! Please put her down!" he pleaded, hoping to defuse the situation. Gigan wrapped himself protectively around the woman's throat to keep her from getting hurt.

The immense strength of Kaylee's grip tightened for a moment before she released the terrified woman, realizing the fear she had instilled.

Gasping for air, the woman scurried away to the safety of the back room, and the rest of the women stepped back away from the two students.

"Are you okay? I don't think you hurt her.  She's just terrified," he urged, his voice reassuring.

Kaylee took a deep breath, her anger slowly dissipating. She nodded, acknowledging Inigo's words. "I'm not good with these places. She should watch where the hell she's going!"

"Hold on, alright? I'm just going to go check on her."

Inigo swiftly chased after the frightened woman, offering his apologies and a card to see his uncle if she needed help.
"I don't think I could go back there, Myoga-kun..." said the woman.
"That's okay. Thanks for bringing us cookies, Kimura-san." Inigo pulled out one of the cookies that had fallen on the floor, with a bit of hair still on it. "They're great too." He took a big bite.
"Goodness. You shouldn't eat that!"
"Mmmhmm-why 'ot? -asty." He gulped it down and winked. "I think the hair adds a touch of nuttiness."
The woman laughed quietly. "I'm fine now. You should go back to your friend."
"If you're sure. But I'm coming back to check on you later, Kimura-san." Inigo grinned and stepped back to head to the front, only to find Kaylee on the other side of the door trying to enter. 

"Hey Kaylee? Looking for the bathroom?"

"I want to talk to her." Kaylee nodded to the woman she had choked.

"Oh, alright. I'll be at the front." 

Inigo glanced back as Kaylee approached Kimura-san. Part of him felt like helping her flee, but the other half wanted to trust Kaylee. Inigo opened the door and left the backroom.

Moments later, Kaylee emerged, her expression softer, and the previously aggrieved woman stood by her side. It was clear that they had made amends.

Inigo smiled from his chair as Kaylee got back. He gave her a thumbs-up. With their time at the salon coming to an end, Inigo and Kaylee left feeling refreshed. As they stepped out onto the bustling streets outside, Inigo spoke, "You know, Kaylee, I've seen a lot of people who've taken the wrong path because they thought it was the only one they had." He looked at Kaylee, who was busy messing up her hair from the neat way they arranged it. "I think you're a good person. If you ever want to talk, I'll be around. I'm down to listen, and even spar," he offered.

Kaylee sighed, skepticism crossing her features. "If you stop talking, I'll go to the stupid festival," she relented, her words revealing a hint of curiosity.

Inigo's grin widened. "Sweet. Alright Kaylee!" He offered a fist-bump to Kaylee, who just stared at him. "C'mon, don't leave me hanging. Too soon, then? We'll get there. I'll have my friends send some yukatas to the salon. Just pick one out, and they'll help you put it on. I bet you'd look great!"

Inigo grinned and bid farewell to Kaylee.

"Thanks, Mr. C!" shouted Inigo as he entered the Cain household. He was let in by Christopher's dad and swiftly made his way towards Chris' room. With excitement in his voice, he knocked on Christopher's bedroom door. "Yo, Chris!"

Christopher opened the door, his expression peeved. "What's up, Inigo?" he asked, sounding slightly irritated.

Inigo barged into the room with a wide grin. "What's up, man? I'm here to drag you to the summer festival."

 "No way. I'm not going." Christopher crossed his arms and shook his head.

"But if you stay home, then Hoge will stay home too!" Inigo's face fell.

Christopher shrugged indifferently. "That's not my problem."

Inigo's eyes sparkled as he pleaded, "Come on, bro. I'm begging you here. Do it for me?" He flashed his best smile and enlarged his eyes.

Christopher frowned. "Fine, if you can beat me in a game, I'll go. But you only have five tries."

"Alright, alright, let's go!"

Christopher retrieved Heroes Clash Unlimited X from his shelf and smiled cruelly. "You see, I have the advantage. I've mastered this game."

Inigo cried out. "Bro, you got that game! No fair."

Christopher smirked. "My rules, man."

The two friends engaged in an intense gaming session. Christopher easily defeated Inigo three times in a row, and then four. Inigo couldn't help but notice that Chris was intentionally playing it easy, allowing his own characters to get low to appear strong before overpowering him with expert combos.
Inigo patiently waited for the right moment. With a mischievous smirk, he said, "By the way, man, I never got you a get-well present." Christopher turned his attention towards Inigo, and in that split second, Inigo swiftly pulled out a rolled-up poster from his bag. "Check it out, it's Nene with Yui from that one party. I had the photo blown up. It's life-size, bro." He grinned and handed it to Chris.

Chris's eyes widened in disbelief. "W-why would you give me this? and then bring it here!" He grabbed the poster and stared.

While Christopher was momentarily distracted, Inigo quickly attacked, overwhelming Christopher's characters.

"POPSY WINS!" the game announced.

Inigo celebrated his victory. "Woohoo! My low-tier character wins!"

"Hell no. You distracted me! You fucking cheated!"

Inigo picked up the poster, a triumphant expression on his face. "Nu-uh, I won fair and square."

"Fuck you. I don't accept it. We're having a rematch. NOW!"

Inigo chuckled. "Nah, bro. I think I'm going to retire from Heroes Clash Unlimited X with the belt and a one win streak! To think I beat the mighty Christopher. I think I'll brag to Yui." He jumped into bed and pantomimed a belt.

Christopher glared and chased Inigo around the room. "Rematch!" Inigo leaped back, using the poster of Nene and Yui as a makeshift shield. "No, dude. You need to bow down to the champion!" 

Christopher growled, "Fuck the champion!"  and grabbed Inigo's leg, trying to bring him down.

"Dude! Watch the poster!" Inigo pulled Christopher into a headlock.

"I don't want the poster!" Christopher retorted, and shoved Inigo aside into an armbar.

At that moment, a knock on the door interrupted their scuffle. "Boys, I've got you something to eat. I know Christopher's been hungry," Christopher's father announced as he entered the room. The sight before him caused him to pause, both boys were wrestling on the bed, on top of the lifesize girls' posters of Nene and Yui. "Oh my, carry on. I guess it's around that time that boys experiment. I'll leave you be."

Christopher's dad quickly exited the room, leaving them to their own awkwardness. Inigo and Chris blinked in disbelief, their faces flushing slightly with embarrassment. Inigo bursts out laughing. 

"It's not like that! Fuck, he's gone," Christopher muttered, flustered by the situation.

Inigo smirked. "Bro, your dad is super chill."

"Yeah, I'm going to have to explain it to him later." Chris sighed.

Both boys flopped down onto the bed, breathing heavily from their impromptu wrestling match, and stared at the ceiling. Inigo broke the silence. "Hey, man. I'm sorry I haven't been around lately."

"It's fine. You were injured too."

"Yeah, it wasn't that bad, though."

Chris sighed and looked out the window. "I can't believe you're forcing me to go to the summer festival."

Inigo's eyes twinkled as he nudged his friend. "So you are going! Might be fun, bro. You can win a lot of prizes in those games. Plus, there'll be girls in yukatas. Yui in a yukata," he added, winking.

Chris frowned, unsure. "I don't know, man. Girls are fucking weird."

"You get along with Kaylee just fine. It's love that's tricky."

Chris' voice felt uncertain. "I don't even know if that's it."

"We all go at our own pace, man." They fist-bumped.

Inigo looked to Chris. "Hey, I've got a hypothetical question for you. Just shut me down if I'm reaching too deep. What if you knew where Desolator was?"

Christopher seemed to be deep in thought. "I'd tell the pros and let them handle it."

"He'll probably just escape that way."

"Then I'll go after him."

Inigo smiled widely. "Dude, take me with you. If you're going to do something dumb again, I want to be the second dumbest person there."

Chris chuckled. "You're always the dumbest person, man. Now give me a rematch."

Inigo reached into his bag. "I'll give you a rematch and risk my Ultimate X title if you beat me in this! Mecho Corez 12!"

Chris sighed. "Not your dumb mech game."

Inigo feigned offense, placing a hand over his heart. "Hey now, it's not dumb, bro. The mech customization alone is insane!"

"Just hurry up and put the game in."

The two friends settled back into their gaming session, shouting over each other as they competed in the world of Mecho Corez 12. It only took three tries for Chris to win a game against Inigo, using one of the default mech setups. Inigo looked out of Chris' window. He could see the lights from the festival already.

The Kyoto Summer Festival was in full swing, with colorful lanterns illuminating the night sky and lively music filling the air. Inigo, wearing a yukata with a vibrant dragon pattern, stood at the entrance of the festival with Junichi. His eyes gleam with excitement as he takes in the festive atmosphere.

Inigo looked at Junichi and said, "Ah, the Kyoto Summer Festival! A perfect place to make some unforgettable memories. So what're you hitting first? I think I might visit my class. They're around here somewhere, you wanna meet em'?"

Junichi shook his head and said, "I'd rather eat a firework. "

Inigo smirked. "Speaking of fireworks, I just happen to know a certain someone is vlogging tonight."

"You're still on that... I never want to see her again."

"There she is now!" Inigo pointed suddenly.

"Where? FUCK!" Junichi's eyes widened as he looked around. Inigo burst out laughing. 

"Nah, she's not here, bro. You should've seen your face. I didn't know you had emotions, man."

"Fuck you!"

"Alright, bro. You look good in your yukata, by the way." He winked.

"So do you. I'm going to smoke."

"Later bro."
***

The sun was setting, casting a warm golden glow over the lively streets of Kyoto. The annual Summer Festival was in full swing now, filling the air with the sounds of laughter and excitement. Inigo, Hifumi, Sandatsu, and Bobby found themselves drawn to a colorful stall adorned with delicate goldfish swimming in small, transparent bowls.

Inigo leaned his head back on his hands. "Alright, that takoyaki hit the spot. Let's spend some energy. Who's up for a challenge?" He declared with a playful grin.

Hifumi raised an eyebrow and smirked. "You're on, man. I've been preparing for this. Get ready to be impressed!" He cracked his knuckles.

 "Don't think I've ever done this one, but I've been practicing my throwing arm, and these fishies won't know what hit 'em!" Bobby interjected.

"This game isn't as daunting as it seems," Sandatsu remarked, his voice steady. 

The friendly stall owner handed each of them a paper scoop and explained the rules. The goal was to scoop up a goldfish using the flimsy paper scoop without tearing it. Inigo chuckled and ran his hand through his hair. "Piece of cake! Watch and learn, my friends." With a dramatic flourish, he swiped at the water, but his scoop barely grazed the surface before it broke, leaving him empty-handed. "Aw, c'mon!"

Bobby, feeling confident, stepped up next. His face furrowed in concentration, as he attempted to scoop up a golden fish. However, his excitement got the better of him, and his scoop ripped apart, causing the fish to slip through his fingers. "No way! I-I'll get it next time! Fish, got away from me there."

Inigo chimed in. "Maybe I should've tried charming the goldfish. See if they'd jump into the scoop. It worked before."

Bobby looked at him incredulously. "Wait, really that could happen?"

Inigo shrugged. "You'll see when I do it."

Hifumi rolled up his sleeves and looked at Bobby. "Bro, you've got to finesse it, not crush it! Let me show you how it's done!" He unleashed a spirited throw, managing to catch a small, shimmering goldfish in his scoop. Pumping his fist in the air, he exclaimed, "Yes!"

"I'll give it a try.." Sandatsu picked up a scoop and took a deep breath. He stared at the bowl for a moment and tossed. He managed to scoop up a goldfish, and his eyes sharpened as he leaned in. The other boys leaned in too. But just as he raised the scoop triumphantly, the paper gave way, and the goldfish slipped back into the water. "Damn.."

The stall owner looked at each of the boys. "You guys want to pay for more scoops?"

They all looked at each other and emptied out their pockets. They were each almost broke. Bobby shook his head. "I don't have much on me. I still have to meet Minnie, you guys."

Hifumi nodded as he emptied out his left pocket.  "I already won anyway. I'll come with you, bro." He peeked at the goldfish inside the plastic bag he was holding. "I've got to give the Boss this little guy."

Inigo looked around. "I should probably try to find Hoge, maybe she came early. Sandy, you good?"

Sandatsu shrugged. "I'll be fine. I'll walk around. Maybe I'll get lucky."

The four boys exchanged farewells and promised to meet up later as they headed in different directions.

Inigo gritted his teeth and focused. He confidently picked up another dart, aiming for the target. But as he released the dart, it veered off course, missing the mark by a wide margin. Inigo's face fell in disappointment.

"Oh, come on! I was so close!" he exclaimed. Gigan squeaked with laughter on his shoulder. "Think you can do better?" Gigan's eyes shined. "Nevermind. I don't have enough money to waste on you."

As he turned around, Inigo's gaze fell upon a familiar figure adorned in a vibrant fox mask. The person seemed to be surrounded by an impressive array of prizes. 

"Whoa, that's some serious loot! Looks like someone struck gold!" Inigo exclaimed, grinning. "I was surprised when I heard you came to this event."

Chihiro paused in front of him and lifted her fox mask slightly. "How did you know it was me?"

Inigo shrugged and rubbed the back of his head. "I saw your red eyes from the mask, and took a guess." He grinned. "So, Chihiro, spill the beans. How many game stalls did you conquer to amass this impressive haul?" 

Chihiro's eyes gleamed. "I'm making my way around. Do you want one?" She held up one of the many prizes she was holding, a plush rabbit, and waved it side to side.

"Nah, thanks, but I'm good. A real man wins his own prizes." He flexed. "By the way, have you seen Hoge? We're supposed to meet up soon."

Chihiro shook her head and pushed her fox mask back on. "No, but I'll keep an eye and a whisker out for her." She tilted to the side slightly and then flitted off between the stalls to her right. 

"Thanks! Good luck conquering the east side, prizemaster!" Inigo grinned. "That's a rare sight, she seemed to be in a better mood than usual."

Inigo turned around happily, but his face fell when he spotted a group of people walking away from the festival. They moved in a peculiar way. He crept forward to investigate, leaving the lights of the stalls and entering the darkness beyond.

Inigo's mind raced as he followed the group of festivalgoers who were acting strangely, almost like zombies under a trance. His instincts told him something was terribly wrong.  He had seen the way they moved before. He ran after them, and ended up venturing into a desolate part of the festival grounds next to a quiet pond. With Gigan floating on his shoulder, Inigo took a step near the banks of the water and looked around. "Where did they go, buddy?" Gigan shrugged.

Suddenly, a chilling voice cut through the silence. "Looking for someone, baby brother?" Luccione's sinister tone echoed from behind. Inigo turned sharply, his blood turned cold as he laid eyes on his older brother, standing there wearing a resplendent golden kimono. He spoke with a wicked grin, while surrounded by thirty tranced festival goers. His gold dragon, Avarice, stood with a twisted, toothy smile behind him.

!!! Villain Name:「Luccione」

	    Quirk:「Visions of Greed」

	    Type: Emitter

	    Description: His golden dragon construct, Avarice, has an aura that creates mind-altering illusions of a person's desires. The greedier a person is, the more susceptible they are to its effects.

"Luccione..." Inigo said quietly, and he pointed at his brother's captives. "Let those people go!"

Luccione's insidious grin widened as he playfully toyed with one of the hypnotized women's hair. "Should I?" he taunted as he made five of the tranced individuals trod halfway into the water. "I could make them drown themselves. Does that count?"

Inigo protested, "No! That doesn't count! Why would that count? Put them back in the festival where they belong!"

Luccione chuckled, his voice dripping with malice. "I'll let them go if you come with me, dear brother."

 "I can't do that. I still have stuff to do here. Look, we can talk later in the clan. Please, let them go," said Inigo as he reached into his backpocket.

Luccione frowned. "Oh, poor baby brother. You'd rather play with your new friends than spend time with me? I have a few visual novels we could enjoy together. I could even use my quirk to show you the girls I've been seeing lately. It'll be just like old times."

Various girls of all shapes and sizes formed in Inigo's vision. He instinctively looked away. "I don't want to play your games. I know you're trying to kill me."

"If I wanted to kill you and your friends, I would've done so already. Our eldest brother will be coronated soon. I want you to join me in my claim as heir. I even left my pawns at home as a courtesy. I come to you with open arms, my lovely brother," said Luccione with a warm tone, he smiled briliantly. For a moment, Inigo was a boy again, being offered a toy by someone he looked up to.

"No! I won't be a puppet in your game!" Inigo roared to shake off Luccione's quirk. He pointed forward, and Gigan pounced towards his brother in its dragon form. Luccione's Avarice met Gigan halfway, and the two dragons clashed. Claws and fangs met dragonscales as they fought.

Luccione's twisted grin contorted into a sadistic sneer. "Well... I tried. It would've been far too dull if you had succumbed so easily. What do you think the headline will be tonight when a hundred souls plunge into the depths of despair and drown themselves in the murky pond? I might even make a few more trips just for you."

"I won't let that happen."

"Then come with me, little brother." Luccione waved his hand, and his golden dragon flew back in front of him, leaving Gigan alone.

To Inigo's horror, Luccione's dragon opened its massive maw, and a young girl, tears streaming down her face, willingly placed her head inside its mouth. Luccione laughed cruelly, relishing his brother's face. "There's the look I've been looking for. Call your dragon back, or she dies."

Inigo recalled Gigan back to his side. Luccione spoke, "Do you know what her desire is right now?" He looked down at the tearful girl. "She wants to run home to mommy and daddy. They had a fight, and she went to the festival even though she wasn't supposed to. How delightful."

Inigo gritted his teeth and held his ground. "You're fucked up, Kaz. What the hell happened to you?"


Fury twisted Luccione's features, his voice dripping with venom. "NEVER CALL ME THAT!" His dragon's jaws loomed perilously close to snapping shut on the girl's fragile form. "You foolish boy! Blessed with a power that blinds you to the true nature of the world. Where as I, was born seeing the hearts of everyone around us.—their filthy, disgusting desires. But don't be mistaken, little brother, we are not so different.  Our family's legacy is drenched in blood."

Inigo stood quiet and looked down, his hair covering his eyes. 

Luccione smirks. "Is the boy who never shuts up at a loss for words? Do you understand now?"

Inigo's gaze hardened, his eyes meeting Luccione's with unwavering determination. "Our legacy may be tainted, but that doesn't mean we have to follow its path. I WILL CHANGE THINGS!" With an outstretched hand, Inigo reached out to the young girl; unbeknownst to Luccione, Inigo had willed his construct behind the girl. Swiftly, Gigan transformed into a mighty emerald hand and whisked the girl away, narrowly avoiding the jaws of Avarice.

"Well played, but I have more. Do you really think you can change things by yourself? Let's teach you a lesson then," Luccione sneered, clapping his hands. In an instant, all the tranced individuals slowly walked toward the water, driven by a compulsion to drown. "Their deaths are on you. You can't change anything, little brother."

Inigo's eyes blazed. "Maybe not by myself, but I'm not alone anymore, Kaz."

"It's too late to call for help." Luccione said with irritation.

"Yeah, but I sent my message five minutes ago in my class' group chat." Inigo pointed straight forward. 

>*IniGOAT*: Yooo people  are DROWNING themselves in EAST POND. BEHIND THE RAFFLE STORE. VILLAIN??? NEED HELP!! HURRY!!!

Luccione's grin faltered as he glanced behind him, there were people yelling and running towards them, and his eyes widened.

"That's one problem solved. Now I'll take care of you!" He charged Luccione on top of Gigan, grabbing him and taking off into the sky, Inigo's fist and Gigan's claws struck flesh. Luccione smirked as his golden dragon rammed Gigan from behind. He flipped away and mounted Avarice. The two brothers soared in the sky above the lake and over the clouds, circling each other as their dragons crashed together. 

Luccione produced illusions that made it difficult for Gigan to maneuver. While Gigan's form shifted and ebbed around Avarice, making it difficult for Avarice to escape. 

Inigo ducked one of Avarice's bites and rolled Gigan under the cover of the clouds. He looked down from his hiding spot. The closest of his classmates had responded to his message. They were all heroes, coming to the rescue of the thirty tranced festivalgoers trying to drown themselves in the pond. 

Hifumi teleported a man to safety with his quirk, his actions swift and precise. Hailey's hair floated as she lifted two girls from the treacherous waters. Kaylee zipped through the watery depths, saving five lives in rapid succession. Christopher soared behind her with three others.

Junichi and Maxine, with their bone-manipulating abilities, plucked two people from the clutches of the drowning pond. Yui's long fibers snaked through the water, acting as a lifeline for several people in the water. Bobby, Orochi, Sandatsu, Edith, and Minnie stood their ground, ensuring the rescued thralls didn't return to the water. Imai and Ashleigh worked together, using their quirks to try and free the minds of the victims. 

Noah lifted people out of the water, passing them to Sally who expertly corralled them, while Hoge and Chihiro, concealed behind festival masks, piloted Faith's drones, swiftly pulling people to safety. Inigo's heart skipped as he gazed down. He wanted to join her, but first he had to deal with Luccione.

Luccione's dragon broke through Inigo's cloud cover with a slash. With renewed determination, Inigo rolled away from the attack. Claws clashed and dragon scales shimmered as the brothers grappled with each other. The air crackled with the intensity of their clash, echoing with roars and the fury of their dragons. Inigo saw his chance and drove Avarice backward with Gigan's claws. Gigan's lower body transformed into a serpent's tail and wrapped around Avarice as Inigo tackled Luccione and started punching him.

Inigo grinned. "You see those kids down there? They're  heroes." Gigan grew. Larger than Luccione's golden dragon. Gigan's mighty tail surrounded Luccione and Avarice, squeezing tightly. "And I'm one of them. That's why people like you will never win." 

"Your dragon might defeat me, but could you defeat my quirk, Ini-boy? I already won when you got too close to me. You don't want to hurt me, little brother." He smiled at Inigo, the full weight of his quirk flaring. Gigan and Inigo were unable to move. "We could be a family again. Even Satoru and Father would be happy. We'll find Mother and bring her home. Then you can bring your friends and your sweetheart to the clan, and we'll throw a big celebration. No more fighting. No more hiding. Isn't that what you want? Such a beautiful, happy route."

Inigo trembled and fell to his knees. Luccione's quirk has never been this strong before. He could imagine it all. No. He could see everything Luccione was describing in crisp detail. It wasn't just a dream, it was like he was actually there. His eyes glazed over.

Luccione smiled. "Now go to sleep..." Gigan shrank, also dazed, as Luccione grabbed the unconscious Inigo, flying away with him on his golden dragon's back. "We have a long way to go until we get home, baby brother."

 He felt warm. He wanted to linger in it; to live in the fantasy where both his worlds could co-exist and end happily. Laughter and melodies filled the air, echoing through the endlessly spacious room of the Thanks a Latte Cafe. He was at a party full of energy and joy. In the midst of the gathering, Hifumi had his arm around his wife, Hailey, relishing his position as the revered #1 hero. 

Sunlight Man cheerfully introduced Minnie to Sunman, while Sandatsu, clutching an urn, found himself chuckling alongside a talking ball. Christopher, with both of his parents by his side, was playing video games with Junichi and the Five. Sally, had chosen to stay in Japan, and wholeheartedly cheered on everyone. Yui, adored by her fans, graciously greeted them at the entrance, while receiving their heartfelt gifts. Nearby, Chihiro, practiced swordsmanship with her parents, who seemed very happy. 

Kaylee, sported a large cast and an eye patch after an epic battle with a villain. She temporarily held the position of #2 while recovering. She glowed in the supportive cheers of everyone around her. Inigo's eldest brother, Sazuo, along with Desolator, shared a lighthearted drink with Rosethorn and Popsy. 

Noah, in the company of Yakuza members, taught them the art of prayer with polite enthusiasm. 

And there, seated next to Inigo, was Hoge, she wore his ring. She was hugging him, and she smelled like spring blossoms and ripe strawberries. To Inigo's right, his mother and father beamed down at him, also enveloping him in an embrace that melted away any worries. Happiness filled the room, and worries faded away into nothingness.

*Maybe this was okay. He could just... stay here... If the brain just showed us what we sensed.. then how is this different from reality? Who's to say which one was real?*

"Would you like more coffee or juice, Ini?" Hoge asked, her voice carrying an eerie undertone of unreality.

"Why decide!? I've made a drink that's just everything!" Hiro's voice resonated through the air, as he thrust a purple bottle of liquid into Inigo's hands.

"Hiro... You're here too?" Inigo's voice questioned.

"I've decided to just marry all the girls in 2-D, man!" Hiro said before he walked away laughing with his wives.

Inigo turned his head and looked around. Something wasn't right. "Hey Inigo. I decided to cut back on the coal. It's no good for the environment. I'm Fusion based now!" Shinkan chuckled and gave him a thumbs up.

 Inigo heard a very faint ringing, a ghostly reminder of the truth. Inigo stared, his gaze fixated on the imperfections, and inconsistencies in the room. It's not right. Many of the people here were already gone, lost forever. Half of the parents vanished, their absence leaving an unfillable void.
Christopher and Junichi were both asshole gamers, and would never play with each other that nicely. Why isn't Sally attached to Noah? Yui would be giving her fans gifts instead of receiving them. And Hoge.. She doesn't smell like anything, and she definitely wouldn't ask him to drink coffee.

As he resisted, the dream changed to draw him deeper. He wasn't just with Hoge,  he found himself surrounded by a legion of women, and every girl from Shiketsu. Seated upon a throne, he was the center of attention, the master of the harem he had wanted at the start. He shook his head.

With a jolt, Inigo woke up on top of Luccione's airborne dragon, his body bound, but he willed Gigan to cut him free. Inigo leaped on top of Luccione from behind and tackled him. He rolled on top of his older brother. "But how!?" Luccione growled. 

"Your quirk won't work again. You don't know what I want." Gigan morphed into armor around him."Because for me the VN ends, when I find the one girl!" Inigo pressed his palm into Luccione's chest. "CRASH DRAGONCLAW!" Gigan enlarged from Inigo's palm and turned into an enormous dragonhand. It twisted to envelop Luccione, Inigo, and Avarice in its titanic grip. They started to fall from the sky.

"Inigo! We're gonna hit the ground!" Luccione struggled. 

"Exactly! I'm taking you down with me!" Inigo grinned and held his quirk as they plummeted faster and faster. They crashed into the woods below with a loud boom.
***
Inigo looked at the unconscious Luccione. His main phone broke in the crash, but his burner phone was fine. He called The Five.

"Hello. Desolator, yes sir. I need you guys to pick someone up for me. It's my brother. I need you to bring him back to the clan. I'll send you his location." Inigo sat down exhaustedly. "I'm gonna need a ride too and a change of clothes for the festival."
***
***
As Inigo dashed towards the Kyoto Summer Festival Grounds. The festive atmosphere surrounding him seemed to fade away as his anxiety grew. He desperately scanned the bustling crowds, hoping to catch a glimpse of Hoge among the sea of people. He felt a sense of deja vu. He was thirty minutes late to their date.

With each passing moment, his nervousness intensified. Doubt crept into his mind, wondering if he had missed his chance to meet her. Had she given up waiting and gone home already? The thought weighed heavily on him, adding to his growing dread.

Inigo quickened his pace, weaving through the throngs of festival-goers.
