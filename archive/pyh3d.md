Imagine marrying Selen Tatsuki and she tells you she wants a kid and that she'll be fine and she'll keep her gaming reps up while pregnant. When she finally gets two lines on her pregnancy test she'll jump and full body hug you crying about how happy she is after trying so hard. Everything is going great for a few months, Selen is glowing and her gamer activities are working out and her belly is quite small on her fridge body. Now imagine in a few months Selen has to stop her intense gaming because her feet hurt and her legs aren't used to holding up her new weight. Her belly extends almost a full foot in front of her and she's gained nearly 15 kilos. Imagine the look on Selen's face when her doctor tells her that she should take a break on her apex reps for a while because she's carrying triplets and the excessive toxicity is doing more harm than good. 

Imagine Selen reluctantly smiling at you and promising to stop pwning n00bs for now for the sake of preparing to take care of three kids at once. Imagine as the weeks go by and her womb fills up more and as her appetite and weight increase with it. Imagine finding your 7 month pregnant wife Selen Tatsuki raiding the fridge in the dark at 4:00 AM with a guilty look on her face when you find her, like a puppy and that gnawed holes into your pillow. Imagine Towering above her while she sits on the floor nervously wiping ice cream drips off of her massive belly and mumbling about how the kids made her do it. Imagine helping Selen up and princess carrying her back to bed and having her ask if she can lie on top of you because you're warm. Imagine Sniffing her hair as she lies facing upwards on top of your torso and guides your hands around her like a scarf. 

Imagine rubbing Selen's hard sensitive nipples and having her complain about how you might get milk everywhere and how she needs to save it for the kids. Imagine teasing Selen about how her breasts are too small to feed three kids and how she'll need to start saving it up early, leading to her not milking herself for weeks and accidentally turning her tiny supple breasts into overfilled perky veiny perky lumps that spurt succulent cream at the slightest touch. Imagine Selen being proud of her breast growth despite it being painful and unhealthy and imagine the look on her face when the doctor says she should just start milking herself and how her husband (you) would probably be willing to help. Imagine spending hours with Selen's now plump squishy body resting on your lap while you suck the milk out of her tits. 

Imagine the extra weight from her pregnancy making it difficult to walk for her and turning her partially immobile during the last month. Imagine Selen tryharding motherly charms like learning to cook and decorating the baby room and lactating. Imagine your comments having made her self concious about her milk production so she starts tryharding supplements and massages to increase her yield to nearly a quart of milk per day. Selen's competitiveness would overpower her small amount of reasoning and have her end up a dairy soaked mess for weeks because of her overstimulated mammaries. Imagine holding her cool dragon hand while she's in the maternity ward giving birth and in her half dazed state right after pushing out three beautiful children she says "my new gahaheheaamers aeeehahheheh" and she falls asleep and you wrap all your children in yellow blankets cause they're legendary and they fall asleep in her arms while you sit next to her and poke her flabby stomach.

God i want to make love and cuddle her so bad /vt/

I want to ask her out on a date to go on the beach and make out by the water

I want to propose to her. I want to see tears of joy running down her face as I'm down on one knee. I want to see the love in her eyes light up even more. For all her achievements mean everything to me

I want to live a happy life with her and we can no longer live without each other for the rest of our lives. All the while we would have kids and a house together.

No other chuuba has made my heart itch so much and ignited my love

I cannot be the only one.

I really fucking love Selen. Everything about her makes me dream for a reality where I live next door to her as a kid and we become best friends. Imagine waking up as this girl's still up playing old games, and having to carry her back to bed since she's too tired to walk there. Imagine her laughing and teasing you until you stay with her and sleep half the day away. I want to hear those loud giggles first thing in the morning. Imagine her dorky whines and laughs as she wants your attention and imagine sitting next to her in your room while you teach her how to play a video game. Selen is so cute, dorky, and lovable. She would definitely be the kind of girl you could scoop up in your arms and tease when you've had enough of her own teasing. I love her too much for words to properly convey, and if you haven't realized just how amazing having her in your life would be, I pity you. The reason she races dragons is because she isn't one, she's an angel. I LOVE THIS GIRL TOO MUCH FOR MY HEART AND SOUL TO HANDLE. I LOVE SELEN

Imagine being friends with Selen in highschool and your parents make you go to Prom together because "you both get along so well and you need to stop playing so many videogames anyways" even though I DON'T LIKE HER THAT WAY MOM LEAVE ME ALONE and then you show up in an uncomfortable suit at her house just wishing you could both play Battlefield 2: Modern Combat on PS2 online together instead but when you get to the front door Selen opens the door and is dressed in a really girly dress that she and her parents picked out and it looks really good on her and makes you blush and you feel for the first time in your life that you may have a crush on a girl except Selen doesn't act any different she is just too confident to be embarrassed looking so girly so she greets you like normal and you both get in the car together with you being self-conscious the whole time because this really pretty girl just acts super close to you the whole time and throughout the night you just can't stop thinking about Selen and how much you like Selen and how pretty she is and even how she smells feminine and oh my god i think I love Selen but the entire time Selen just makes fun of you as she always does even poking fun at how you're acting weird tonight and you just can't get her out of your head so at the end of the night you decide to just straight up ask her to be your girlfriend which you do but it's really awkward and you don't seem cool at all and she just laughs at you about it so you think you're getting rejected but then at the last second she says sure and that she's surprised you even had the balls to ask her out so then you date Selen and kiss her and fuck her and get married and have kids and live a happy life together and nothing ever goes wrong forever with you with Selen and you're with Selen who is cool and you like a lot.

God I want to impregnate a chubby fridge body dragon so fucking badly imagine how cute and round her belly would be compared to her rectangle frame it would be so contrasting and hot and it would make her big right womb look even bigger and tighter and with every pregnancy her body would slowly change shape and after enough time her curveless frame would morph into a complete fertility idol and everyone who made fun of her for having the bodyshape of a barrel will have to eat their own words and my dust because my previously fridge wife will be so fucking hourglass and curvy and ready at any time to almost effortlessly nuture and birth another dozen of my children all the other women will be absolutely seething with rage over hot utterly astoundingly fecund she will be
