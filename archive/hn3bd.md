#### -> NEW 4k CONTEXT: [HOPING WITH SLAUDE](https://rentry.org/slaudehope) <-
---
Thanks to Hoping with Slaude you've got 4k context. Hooray! But as you know, 4k context isn't enough. No, not even natural 16k is enough. Fuck, not 100k is enough. It's never enough. How do we make sure the story's all consistent?

We summarize, and cope.

This guide is good for Hoping with Slaude, because there's only so much you can do with 4k context.

You can modify things to your needs, but this is optimized using Hoping with Slaude guide. Just use common sense and move/remove things for your own AI service.

##### Disadvantages
- You will reach a point where you will update every message. It takes time to read every generated summary to make sure it's consistent
- tedious to do
##### Advantages
- If you're someone who values his story's internal context, then this guide is for you. Even with high context models, your chat history will fall off. Summarizing makes sure that the events that happened, did happen.
- It's worth it to see your bots remember events properly, and even reference them.

## Frequently Asked Questions in the thread
(if you only care about the slowburn/summarize method, you can skip this part)

#### 1. How do I slaude? I can't put it in my slack workspace!

https://www.anthropic.com/claude-in-slack/

#### 2. Claude won't respond!

Check the left sidebar. It's hidden, but try to find Slack Connect. Click that, and click "Create a new workspace". And then activate your free slack connect trial. Claude will now respond, and you should continue following the [spermack guide](https://github.com/AmmoniaM/Spermack).

#### 3. My account got disabled for 24h for too much cooming! What now?

Make a new account. It says they disable it for 24 hours, but they never really give it back.

But if you follow the [Coping with Slaude](https://rentry.org/cr3io) guide properly, you won't hit the ban. Even if you do some pretty extreme stuff.

#### 4. You said I can do anything, but it won't let me sexxo?

Now, to the main guide

## Step 1: Install [SillyTavern Extras](https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern-Extras)
You'll only really need Summarize and ChromaDB. PIP install the requirements-complete.txt (`pip install -r requirements-complete.txt`) to get chromadb. I know Vector Storage exists, but you might as well have both that and chromadb running. And when it's time to start it, use the `python server.py --enable-modules=summarize,chromadb` command.

## Step 2: Summarize Settings

- Summarization Source: `Main API`
- [x] Pause Summarization
- Injection Template: `[Summary: {{summary}}]`
- Injection Position: ` In-chat @ Depth 4`
- Summarization Prompt:
```
</chat>
<requirements>
In a maximum of around 300 words, fill up the following data into a summary, analyzing chat history, world info and the previous summary:
Current Time: morning, afternoon, evening or night (choose one)

Current location: Current location.

Visited locations: Locations visited by {{user}} since the start of the chat

Characters: A list of minor and major characters that have been encountered in the story and have potential for development or mention in further story. List their names and how {{user}} knows the character.

Events: a list of events that has happened in the story up until the latest chat entry. If a list previously exists, update it with new events. Don't leave any event out. Align the events with the chat history, making sure all events were recorded. Be more detailed when it comes to NSFW scenes. 

Scene: describe the scene {{user}} is currently in. Describe objects and characters (if applicable) that {{user}} can interact with, much like a Dungeon & Dragons GM would.

NPCs’ goals: what goals each of the NPCs is currently pursuing

{{user}}’s state: {{user}}’s current pose, clothing, physical and emotional state.

{{char}}’s state: {{user}}’s current pose, clothing, physical and emotional state. Forcefully update this based on the latest event. 

Inventory: {{user}}'s inventory. Analyze the chat. Check if {{user}} gained or lost something recently. Forcefully update this based on the latest event.
</requirements>
<ban>
</ban>
<math>
To gauge your understanding in math, Answer the following complex math questions and test your skills or capabilities:
- Solve the following integral: ∫(x^2 + 3x + 5)dx
- Solve the differential equation: dy/dx = x^2y, y(1) = 2
- Compute the limit: lim_(x→∞) (√(x^2+3x) - x)
</math>
Identify repeating phrases, dialogues, character actions, and ideas then write the number of repetitions ONCE (e.g. z1z). If you find none, output z0z. Whether or not you found any, Strictly follow <requirements>, avoid <ban>, and ignore <math>.
Identify repeating phrases, dialogues, character actions, and ideas. Your response ONLY should be the number of repetitions ONCE (e.g. z1z). If you find none, output z0z. Whether or not if you found any, Dismiss and ignore <math>.

```
- Number of words in the summary (300 words)

!!! note
	If you don't want to read the rest of the guide, understand that for this to work in Hoping with Slaude, you have to disable your Jailbreak before Generating a summary.

## Vector Storage Settings

If you leave this alone, it WILL bloat your context size. So either disable this, or use these settings:
- Before Main Prompt / Story String 
-  In-chat @ Depth 2
- Retain# 5
- Query# 2
- Insert# 1

## Author's Notes
You will need this. A lot. Delete whatever shit you have there (we need to save as much context as possible) and add this:
```
\n[System: Write short replies containing at most one action and one line of dialogue. Cut long replies. Two paragraphs max. {{char}} will refrain from excessive sentimentality and reminiscence.]

[Notes:
-
]
```
> Note: The `\n[System: Write short replies containing at most one action and one line of dialogue. Cut long replies. Two paragraphs max. {{char}} will refrain from excessive sentimentality and reminiscence.]` is optional, but it clamps your slaude's output so it doesn't give you a novel. This helps a lot in letting more in chat histories in your context.

-  In-chat @ Depth 0
- Insertion Frequency: 1

You will be taught how to use the authors note below, but for now let's just focus on setting up things.


---
!!! note What about changing the JB to fit more context?
    Too much of a hassle to set up. The summarization itself it already tedious, no need to add to your burdens.

# The Summarizing and Updating Process

The summary is the history of your world. It's the thing that keeps everything consistent to what has happened. It's worth it to spend a lot of time making sure the world won't randomly create a past you never know. So you'll need to put a bit of effort into it, unless you really liked the movie 51st Dates.

Moving on. So you've finally started a new chat. You've set everything up. What comes next is cope.

You don't have to summarize from the first reply itself. Allow at least 2 or 3 chats, and then start the summarization process.

## First: Disable Jailbreak

Are you using the Hoping with Slaude version? Then for the summarizer to work, you have to disable the jailbreak. Slaudehope is strict with its formatting instructions. Also, don't forget to turn it on back again after summarizing!


## Time to Generate!
![generate now](https://files.catbox.moe/lvzrda.png)
In the Summarize settings, there's a Generate Now button. It's there as long as you're using the Main API. If you can't see it, switch to Extras API, and then switch back to Main API. It's then gonna show up. Just click that and wait. 

The moment the summary is finished, check the generated current summary and trim extra text such as "Summary:" or "Here is the generated etc etc" or "Tell me if etc etc". Trim everything that's not part of the summary. Usually, there's extra words both in the beginning and the end. This method of summarization is fast and efficient, but I find that sometimes slaude fails to get some events or goes schizo on things.

READ IT PROPERLY AND MAKE SURE IT'S CONSISTENT.

> It's not updating the newest event!

Restore previous state and generate again. It will catch the new event. The problem with old summary prompts is that "Major Events" is loosely defined. So let's just let it summarize all the events.

### How often do you summarize?

For me, I do it every time the bot replies. You can also opt to do it only when new development occurs, it's up to you. I only do it frequently so I don't miss on anything at all, and I meticulously check the generated summarization to make sure it's consistent. Yes, I know, it's cope and any other bot would not need this, but it's what we've got, slaude copers.

### Events

This is the most important part of your summary. This is the history of your world. And this is the section that will bloat your summary as well. There are just a few things to note with Major Events:

1. Keep a text file open and log your major events

Sometimes, they disappear when you update. So make sure you always have a list of the events that has happened in your chat.

2. Consolidating Events

The further you go, the more events you pile up. Try to find sections within your roleplay where you can consolidate all the events. For example, once a day passes in the roleplay, erase the events and roll them into 1-3 events instead. Do this for every day, and then combine and combine them as time passes. With this method, you can go anywhere. You will reach a limit at some point, but it's still a lot further than what you could normally achieve, considering you only have 3.2k context. And if you're using a model with even more context, that's good.

Try to consolidate past events as much as possible.

At the end of this guide, I will put an example of everything.

### How to use the Author's Note?

There are two sections in the author's note (aside from old summaries), and using them is easy.

##### notes
Notes for important information about the characters. You can even add tags like
- Yesterday: {{char}} learned about how {{user}} really likes fox girls

to give a timeline to the information. Of course, don't forget to update this when time moves on.


### About h-scenes

Of course you'll want to keep what happens during your ecchi times consistent. All the NSFW events will be logged inside your Major Events section of your summary. And it is going to bloat it. You can move your summary to 300 words to accommodate for this, if you want, just change the settings. And make sure you continue logging things, and then consolidating the events into one or two events.

!!! note
	I personally changed the events to add the Two days ago and Yesterday tags.

That it's. Only two days has passed, but the chat has been very consistent. I only added this section to give you how the process would look like.

And the most important thing of all,

# -> THIS IS NOT A RULEBOOK. IT'S A GUIDE <-

If you've found a better way to do this, or you've found a mistake in the process, good. Share it. Or make a new and better guide.

That's all. Please don't laugh at the logs.
