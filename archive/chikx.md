#The Dyke Vixen Story
Part 1
"Uh oh, here come the dykes"
>there were three of them.
>vixens.
>vixens with unnaturally colored hair.
>red, blue and green.
>"razors" (because she cuts herself, always wearing long sleeves) 
>"braces" (Because she had braces. Still.)
>and "glasses" (because her father is the town's only ophthalmologist and yet people would rather go to the next town over.)
>(Yes, she wears glasses.)
>the loudest lesbians on this campus.
>gay flag pins, annoying catchphrase patches on backpacks, anime sweatshirts.
>flamboyant speech, annoying laughter, judgemental looks.
>so I bully them.
>Sitting atop the stone wall lining the plaza, I assault their ears.
"Dykes."
>A frog in my throat makes me mumble so I say it again, louder. "DYKES"
>That stops them in their tracks. 
>And starts a shit flinging contest.
>"Are you seriously doing this shit again you fucking homophobic?" screeches Razors.
>Glasses tries to be more thoughtful, brushing aside her bangs as she speaks.
> "Why don't you take your small cock and mess with someone your own size."
"Is that all you can think of, glasses?" I retort. "Try to make up for your father talking about all that dick."
>"MY NAME IS GRETCHIN."
>That's really when the shit flinging starts.
>and the screaming
>Glasses likes the stop her legs while Razors flails like a child. 
>And Braces, after huffing and puffing, prefers to throw books at me, or slap things out of my hand.
>But Braces isn't doing her usual stick.
>In fact its when she gets going the other two stop and push her toward class.
>Right now they're just screaming until their face goes red through their fur.
>Having argued about abortion for five minutes with the other two broads, I set my targets on Braces.
"Speaking of dead babes, why haven't you said a word?"
>Braces, I think her names Bedelia, doesn't say a word. 
> In fact she doesn't even seem like she's really there.
"Earth to braces, you gonna pipe in or are you gonna leave them in your mouth?"
>That barely made sense but that didn't matter, Braces didn't seem bothered.
>In fact her face was neutral, her eyes wide. 
>They seemed glazed over, and baggy.
>Her silence got the other two quiet.
>"Bedelia, are you alright?" Said Razors, rubbing her sleeve covered arm.
>"Yeah! Bedelia, help me out."
>"huh?" Braces seemed to slowly come to her senses. "Oh, yeah. Ugh."
>With a groan, she put her hands on her friends shoulders and gave them a shove towards the chemistry building. 
>"Go on to class without me guys."
>"Bedelia, are you coming?" 
>She waved them off. "Run ahead, I'm gonna deal with him."
>Glasses bowl haircut got frazzled as she responded. "Bedelia..?"
>They exchanged some kind of invisible girl signal, and then the green and red haired harpies walked off.
>Leaving me, alone with the blue haired of the vixen trio.
>The wind blew and the leaves of the university plaza sycamores rustled overhead.
>Bedelia took a seat next to me on the brick wall and coughed. 
>Her actual tail, like any other foxes' tail, though with the white tip dyed blue, brushed against me back and forth.
>She spoke while looking away, so It was like a blue ponytail was speaking to me.
>"What will it take for you to stop bullying my friends?" 
>My mind froze.
>Fuck, I didn't think this would ever happen. 
>I just figured they would graduate or campus police would one day be called and arrest me.
>Ah fuck I need an answer. 
"Blowjob."
>Ah fuck I'm getting arrested for sexual harassment.
>Bedelia's ears seem to perk up.
>The tail thwapping stops. 
>She turns to face me.
>Bedelia's got nice eyes, half brown, half green, split down the center on both eyes. 
>"...What number your Dorm?"
>What. 
"Uh... Y65"
> I cough and repeat the phrase. 
>"Alright, see you after class."
>And so she gets up and walks into the chemistry building, leaving me speechless. 
>Then she runs back out the door.
>Gets up in my face.
>And kisses me.
>her lips feel like heaven.
>I don't think I ever felt so much passion in such a short peck.
>I'm left staring after she pulls away and heads back towards the chemistry building. 
>I brush my knuckle against my lip.
>Her turquoise gloss smudges against my hand.
>Fuck, is that going to be on my dick.
>Wait.
"Wait, you mean after chemistry? AFTER WHICH CLASS?"
>I get no answer as I watch her running, tail swishing.
>I guess I'll wait in my dorm all day today.

Part 2
"Its about time."
>She was on the other side of the door.
>Bedelia
>The vixen.
>With pink braces.
>and dyed hair. 
>Dark blue bangs tied up in a ponytail.
>It actually matched the orange color of her fur pretty well. 
>Which also went well with her Half green, half brown eyes.
>Eyes that were lit up as she stood on the other side of the doorway, happy.
>Happiest she's ever been in my presence.
"Uh...come on in, I guess. 
>I step out of the doorway and let her pass me. 
>She comes just up to my chin, her tail brushing against my knee as she walked in.
>"Sorry for the wait. Chemistry class."
"No its fine. I get it."
>It had been six hours.
>In the time that passed there was a room organized, bed made, shower taken, homework finished, studying occured, week planned, and several life goals written to paper and committed to memory. 
>the desperate need to make time fly for the nookie necessitated creativity.
>In the time that had passed I had forgotten my bully facade. 
>With her in my room now though, old habits came to the forefront of my mind.
>I leaned against my wall and crossed my arms.
"So, uh, are you embarrassed being a dyke and having to suck dick?"
>I was totally unprepared for being tackled by Bedelia.
>I hit my head against the teak ground, just short of the door. 
>Bedelia, climbing on me until her breasts were in my face, pushed the door closed.
>"Alright, now that we have some privacy."
"I was going to shut it." I say. 
>"Will you shut your mouth?"
>The audacity of this bitch.
>The vixen scooted back until she was in my face, and placed her hands on my shoulders.
"What-"
>Before I could finish, her lips were against mine 
>A repeat of that loveliness that transposed earlier.
>Only now more intense, her sand-paper like tongue snaking its way into my mouth. 
>Meanwhile my tongue entered hers and tasted the metal and rubber of her braces.
>For five minutes it was like I was fighting to breathe, her cold nose freezing my own.
>When she finally pulled back I gasped. 
"Bedelia..."
>"I'm calling your bluff, you."
>What?
>"You've been a thorn in our side since we were freshmen. You really think I'd believe one blow job would make you fuck off?"
"UH YEAH? ARE YOU AWARE OF HOW TOUCH STARVED I AM?" 
>My spout of anger earns me another round of tongue wrestling from the vixen.
>Bedelia pulls back quickly, a string of spit from my mouth trailing off her canines. 
>Now she was the one gasping, cupping a hand to my cheek as she regained control of her breath.
>"I... am giving you a new offer." 
>I raise an eyebrow.
>"You can never see us again. And I mean all three of us vixens. NEVER EVER see us again. I WILL convince those other two to come with me to another university to finish our degree." 
>That means spending the rest of junior and senior years entirely devoid of the dyke vixens on campus.
>but then I feel the claws of her left hand against my junk.
>"OR, you fuck me, right here, right now, for 24 hours. Just you and me, condoms excluded."
"Is that it?" I retorted.
>She nods a "yes."
>That doesn't seem that bad of an offer.
>Hell the no condoms thing sounds nice. 
>She's a college vixen. 
> She probably has an IUD, those things prevent periods.
>I think.
>and she can't possibly mean 24 hours straight sex.
>Just alone with her, naked, for 24 hours, probably sex and naps. 
>I mean, sure I could take the other option. 
>Instead I should think of this as the ultimate win.
>But as she pulls me into a hug and presses her C-cup breasts against my chest, I don't think I want that.
>l bullied a dyke into becoming straight to shut me up.
>Just wait until the guys hear about this!
>I push her away and give her a stern look. 
"Alright, I would rather have sex with you than see you leave, as much as that would bring me joy."
>Bedelia's pink braces shine as she gives a wide grin. 
>Without a word her hands are back on my shoulders, using them to stand herself back up.
>Turning away from me to face my bed, her tail brushes under my nose.
>Then with grace she kneels on the mattress. 
>Her paws hook her denim shorts and pull down, revealing lace-lined blue panties.

Part 3
"I'm really, really happy you picked this option."
>Bedelia said, grinning over her shoulder.
>Her tail was raised.
>Her blue panties were visibly soaked.
>And she was aware of it
>Proud even.
>Hooking her thumbs in her panties, she pulled them down.
>Slowly.
>Painfully slow.
>So slow it took me a second to process.
>Between her legs, under her ass.
>A Pink
>Puffy
>Pyramid.
>On its face a concave Y shape.
>A sliver of girl cum connecting it to her panties.
>"Well, anon?"
>Well.
>I never thought anthro's were that different.
>but, then again... 
>Bedelia coughs.
>Her ears are folded down, a worried look on her face.
>"Y-you weren't expecting that..?"
>Her tail goes down, covering her alien pussy. 
"Uh yeah but I..."
>The vixen collapses forward on your bed.
>She grabs the nearest pillow and pulls it to her face and screams
>Kicking her paws against the mattress
>The motion moving her tall enough for glimpses of her pussy to be seen.
>I grab a chair and pull it beside her.
"Uh... you good?"
>Remembering something out of a movie, I reach for Bedelia's hand.
>She snatches my wrist.
>She looks up from the pillow.
>Mascara is running down her face.
>A look of pain and anger was on it.
>"I know. Don't give me any of your pity. If you think I'm too ugly to fuck then just say it."
"What."
>Her grip tightens around my wrist.
>I wince.
>She bares her teeth
>"My pussy. Looks. Ugly. And you're no longer interested." 
>I wretch my hand from her grasp and rub my wrist.
>I seethe a bit before I reply.
"Alright broad I don't know who hurt you but this is totally not what I signed up for."
>"For a disgusting spade? FOR A GIRL HAVING EMOTIONS?"
>Her yelling takes me back.
>I take a breath and try not to mumble my reply.
"For a bit of mutual pleasure without pain."
>"Well, that's not possible?"
>I raise an eyebrow. 
"What? Why?"
>"Because you were gonna have to hurt me breaking my hymen!"
"Okay. Not what I meant, but alright." 
>"WELL WHAT DID YOU MEAN?"
>She was screaming in my face, and now I was really afraid the neighbors might hear her.
>I take a breath and look out the window.
"To have sex without strings. Those stupid strings. Get wrapped up in them, and then when you thought they meant something, they choke you. And it keeps happening. Why? Because I'm a shit judge of character."
> I point towards myself.
"Knowing all of our interactions up until now. The kicking and scratching. The name calling and arguing. Do you really think we'd make a functional couple? I mean for fucks sake I thought you were a lesbian."
>She coughs.
>"I mean, I'm just bi."
>I roll my eyes and wave my hand towards her. 
"And yet, despite all the shit I've put you through and everything I dislike about you, I want to fuck the everlasting dog shit out of you. I want to feel so close to you that it's like we're becoming whole or some shit. I want to spend 24 hours in your grasp so much because I figure it will be the last time I ever have sex and quite honestly I'm glad it'd be with you."
>When I finished, the Vixen was face to face with me.
>While the torrent of words had flowed, Bedelia had got on her hands and knees and sat up.
>Her face was now a mixture of sadness and happiness, a tear forming on her face. 
>"Really?"
"Yes. Really."
>I scratch the back of my head.
"It's retarded. I'm retarded. I said I wanted no strings and I'm pouring my heart out. I don't want this to turn into me explaining myself. I don't think I'm wrong, I don't want to fight-" 
>"Then lets not!"
>My spiel is interrupted by Bedelia.
>Once again her tongue is down my throat.
>Then she pulls away. 
>"Your little speech got me hot and bothered, anon. Now fuck me before you find a way to turn me off

Part 4
"Your funeral."
>I put my hands on Bedelia's shoulder and push her onto the bed 
>She gasps as I do so, not expecting my aggression.
>Her legs spread as I lay atop her, feeling the warmth wetness of her crotch through my pants.
>I kiss her neck, covering her fluffy neck and inhaling her scent.
>Blueberry shampoo.
>She giggles, once more her legs kicking out from under me and wrapping themselves in the small of my neck. 
>"Lose the pants loser!" 
>I wipe the spittle off my lips.
"Not yet." 
>Putting my hands on her knees, I break free of her full-body grip and make my way downwards.
>Passing her still covered breasts, I lift her shirt to reveal a laced blue bra, built to provide support while lacking enough fabric for her nipples to be out. >"Oh i forgot I wore thaAAAH!"
>Her excuses are drowned out in ecstasy as her nipples receive their own kiss. 
>Then I continue south, kissing the fluff of her tummy before finally reaching her-
>What did she call it?
>Disgusting spade?
>It wasn't disgusting.
>It was... hot.
>The air around it was warm as hell. 
>The pink skin itself, moist and soft.
>And it smelt nice.
>Clean. 
>Tangy.
>But
>Did it taste nice? 
>"Y-you don't have to-GAAAah!"
>Yes.
>It tasted great.
>I dug my tongue into Bedelia's pussy, my nose rubbing against the fur.
>The Vixen's fingers dug into my hair while her tail whipped against my mattress.
>Her moans became screeches.
>And then as my tongue circled around her clit.
>Gekkers. 
>My scalp was burning.
>My mouth was drowning. 
>My nose was choking.
>And my ears were ringing.
>It was blissful. 
>Until finally, Bedelia's thighs enveloped my head.
>I heard her scream.
>I tasted a hot liquid, like sticky sea water, pouring into my mouth. 
>Finally she pushed my head out from under her person.
>I landed on my ass, gazing up to see Bedelia sprawled on my bed, gasping as her pussy pulsed as every little orgasm sent girl cum skyward to land on my carpet.
>Getting up, I undid my pants and pulled down my underwear.
>I was hard. 
>Bedelia was still gasping, her eyes closed and a shit eating grin plastered on her muzzle. 
>When I took my position back on top of her, her eyes went wide.
>Almost startled, The vixen pushed against me, peering down to see my junk. 
>"Anon... do you want me t-"
"No."
>I plant a kiss on Bedelia's forehead, and scratch behind her ears. "Are you ready?"
>She gazes up at me with those beautiful green and brown eyes.
>She whispers something.
>But I can't even hear it.
"Hmmm?"
>She nods.
>"Yes."
>I give her one last kiss on the nose. 
>For good luck
>Then I line myself up.
>Her gooey sex still leaking excitement. 
>And thrust ever carefully forward.
>Bedelia hisses between her teeth 
>I feel enveloped in warmth as my tip enters her.
>Then I stop.
>Not out of my own volition. 
>But my dick wont go further.
>Bedelia is moaning as I go back and forth. 
>But it's literally just the tip of my dick being inside of her.
>It wont go on further.
>What the fuck.
>I hump her again, a little harder, a little faster. 
>"Anon?"
"MY COCK WONT FIT."
>"A-Anon, you should-"
>With all my might I pull out of her and with one swift motion I thrust into her, feeling the resistance one more time before finally- 
>"ANON!"
>Bedelia gasps. 
>Her legs go straight.
>And I go deeper.
>The vixen squeals as I slowly bottom out in her, until finally I feel her spade pressing against my stomach. 
>The vixen relaxes, her legs bending around the small of my back while her hands grip my shoulder.
>I feel her nose against my neck as she takes a deep inhale. 
>"Asshole." 
"Sorry."
>"Oh, you're sorry?"
>She cusps her fuzzy palm under my chin and curves my chin down.
>Her face comes up to mine. 
>In her eyes, a fury I've only seen before she threw books at me.
>"Anon."
"Bedelia."
>She moves her muzzle up to my ear. 
>Her warm breath makes the hairs on the back of my neck straighten as she whispers:
>"Put a baby in me."

Part 5
"My neighbors are going to kill me."
>Bedelia was screaming.
>moaning, really.
>really, really loud.
>her mouth, open.
>her pink braces, not really doing anything except you know, being on her teeth and looking cute.
>her tail was whipped back and forth uncontrollably.
>her blue bangs bobbed up and down.
>her eyes closed, the only downside. >It was a beautiful sight to behold as I jack hammered the vixen.
>our thighs were wet, my sweat and her fluids causing her fur to stick to me.
>It didn't make much a difference.
>the way we were, her on the bed, me standing, I could use my legs to pry us apart. 
>and collide once more, just to do it all over again.
>Bedelia gave another sharp howl. 
>I put my hand behind her neck and pulled her in for a kiss, shutting her up for a few measly seconds. 
> I need to finish this, there's no way in hell the cops weren't on their way.
>In Between gasps and moans Bedelia spoke.
>"In...in...Inside..."
I'm not close." 
>A look of pure horror crept on the Vixen's face.
>Her body tensed again. 
>She grabbed her muzzle and whimpered as her legs and tail went straight.
>I felt a warm wetness run down my leg.
"You dirty whore."
>I pushed her shoulders down and held her on the bed.
"You're gonna pay for that."
>It was my tum..
>I mean it was already me on the attack, doing all the work.
> But now I'm going to do even more work. 
>I grabbed one of her tits, purposefully disrupting her lingerie and sucking on her nipple. 
>It elucidated a moan but made humping kind of difficult.
>So I just grabbed her face again and shoved my tongue down her throat. 
>Now the tables have turned.
>Once I was satisfied, I put my hands on her hips and focused on pounding her.
>My thighs were chaffing against the edge of the bed.
>My hips burning. 
>At least Bedelia was tight and slick, driving me closer and closer.
>She started to yowl again. 
>I couldn't even muster the breath to tell her to shut up.
>I just closed my eyes and focused on humping her
>"yes... Yes...YESİ
>Bedelia's hands gripped the bed sheets and lifted them up.
>Her claws ripping into the cover of the bed.
>"CUM INSIDE ME DAMMIT."
>And with one hard thrust into her, smashing against her cervix, I came inside the vixen, before finally collapsing on top of her.
>My face in her neck fluff, I took a deep breath of Bedelia's scent.
>Did I... smell like her?
>There we were, basking in the afterglow.
>Bedelia's finger played with my hair, hers ruffed and filled with cowlicks from all the sweat and fun.
>I still haven't left the crook of her neck, staring out at the window for several minutes, when I heard her speak.
>"Anon...nonny 
>I turned to face her, accidentally booping her muzzle with my nose.
>She rubbed her muzzle and giggled.
>It was a beautiful noise. 
>God, I was bullying this beautiful creature?
>Our eyes met. 
>Her brown and green eyes seemed to capture the sunlight perfectly.
>Her mouth was left open, and her braces looked cute and even beautiful, like shining gems, as weird as it sounds.
>"Anon... I love you."
>Hearing those words, I was at a loss.
>This vixen, who not 24 hours ago was an annoyance to this campus, such a nuisance to my existence that I bullied her to the point of causing physical harm to myself.
>This vixen was now in my room, on my bed, in my arms.
>And quite possibly in my heart.
>possibly?
>In her eyes was a glimmer.
>why not definitely? 
I love you, Bedelia."
>Her ears went down. 
>Tears started to stream from the vixen's eyes.
>"Oh... anon
>suddenly, her arms wrapped around my neck and I was pulled into a hug I couldn't escape.
>A hug I couldn't breath in, either. 
"B-Beddy..."
>She let me go and I gasped.
>"Sorry."
>On her face was a goofy smiled, her braces out for the world to see.
>"I'm just so happy. I love you."
"I love you too bedelia."
>"duooah, heheheheh."
>Her cheeks went redder than normal.
>She put her hands to her muzzle and defaulted to a muffled gekkering. 
>When that subsided, she was back staring in my eyes with a frown.
"Yes?"
>Her black furred hand tapped on my chest, still covered by my sweat-soaked t-shirt.
>"Round two?"
>I gave the vixen a shit eating grin.
>As we dived into the bed, entangled in one another's limbs as our tongues met, I heard a knocking at the door.
"FUCK." 
>Bedelia's hands were on my cheek.
>"Oh don't be so fussy." 
>The knocking sounded again.
>And then came a familiar shrill voice, which made Bedelia's ears perk up.
>"ANON! WHERE IS BEDELIA?"
>"Ooh! I got this."
>Out from under me Bedelia scampered, getting off the bed in an undressed state as she headed for the door.
>"ANON! OPEN THIS DOOR!"
>Bedelia grabbed the door and swung it open just wide enough for her head to peek through.
>"Hi Gretchin."
>"Bedelia! Where is anon? And why are you naked?" 
>I started to pull my pants on, but seeing my partner in a similar state of undress, I remained naked, instead getting off the bed and approaching the unsuspecting Bedelia.
>Her ass was perked up, her tail leaning over the side of her body, revealing a white heart shape on her ass with her pussy being the heart's tip
>Her pussy, still leaking cum onto the carpet.
>"Don't worry about it, Gretchin. Me and Anon were just... working out our difficulties. In a peaceful manner." 
>"Okay. Well. Wait, did you fuck him?" 
>I came up on Bedelia without her noticing, as she seemed entirely focused on dealing with Gretchin based off that smug look on her face.
>"Why, yes. I did in fact fuck anon. And it was great."
>"What? Why? Did you get off your heat blockers again?" 
>"Why yes, yes I did." 
>"Girl, you totally fucked with your brain chemistry! If you were taking your pills you wouldn't be doing this! 
>"So what? Maybe I'm not the same vixen on the pills that you deal with. Maybe I'm the real Bedelia, and maybe I like getting my brains railed out by anons nice fat human cock!"
>As if that were the command, I grabbed Bedelia by her tail and pulled her ass against me, hilting her right in front of Gretchin
>"GASP. Oh... OH." Where all that Bedelia could say.
>"Oh my god you are crazy" Gretchin said, taking a step back from the doorway. 
>I pounded Bedelia right there, her slowly regaining some self control to speak to Gretchin. 
>"No, G-guh Gretchin!-ah am finally s-ah sane. Ah. T-This is who-ah I aaaamm. I am in uh love with anon. I ah-am going to have his kids. Ah. And you ca-ah can accept it -uh. Or ggghuoh."
>On the other side of the door, Gretchin just stood there.
>Finger to her chin and mouth in an "O shape, like she were a curious monkey at a zoo, trying to come up with a reaction. 
>Bedelia meanwhile was trying to keep her moans in check. 
>It was at this point, fucking my vixen from behind, I noticed her asshole.
>In a single motion, I stuck a finger in it, causing Bedelia to yelp.
>"Ooohh ok no more doggy style for you." Bedelia said in a surprising act of clarity.
>In one move she was turned around, standing on the tips of her paws as I fucked her.
>I turned to place her against the wall, picking her up in the process and facilitating a gasp. 
>Fucking her back against the wall all while Gretchin looked.
>As we shagged, Gretchin said "Can I..." 
>To which Bedelia responded very loudly "NO!"
>And with that Bedelia pushed the door closed on the green haired Gretchin.
>"Now..." Bedelia said, a look of evil in her eye.
"Now..." I repeated, stopping my assault on her womb.
>"Lets finish round 2, then I want to discuss baby names. And dinner." 
>As I continued into Round 2 of fucking Bedelia, my blue haired vixen GF and probably future vixen wife, part of me was worried for what the future held. 
>Babies were big talk for someone with still a year to graduate college.
>But those were worries, no, problems to solve tomorrow. 
>Today, I will give all my focus to Bedelia. 
>As my climax approaches, I think of something witty to say.
>Something for old times sake.
"Uh oh, I'm coming inside my dyke."
The End.
