##I. Dai-Ichi Ikkai Dungeon 
*September 25th | 3 days before the Exams*
***
In the vast dungeons beneath the ancient temple of the Daiichi clan, Inigo came upon his imprisoned brother Luccione. In that dank cell lit only by flickering torchlight, Luccione sat chained against the wall, a strange metal collar around his neck suppressing his quirk. At Inigo's arrival a twisted grin split his gaunt face.

"Come to gloat, little brother?" Luccione rasped in mocking tones. "How righteous you must feel."

Inigo met his brother's gaze steadily. "I don’t feel good about this. But you left me no choice."

Luccione rattled his chains. "Look at you, standing in judgment over me from your lofty perch. I'd be proud if I did not find these chains so cold and drab. Do you have any lip balm?"

"I always carry lip balm, Luccione. I’m not a savage. And I'll never forget your first beauty lessons," Inigo said, looking away from his brother's frazzled hair and dry skin. It's truly horrible. They didn’t even leave him any moisturizer. 

"Don't look at me," Luccione said in shame, his silver hair covering his face.  He had several split ends and his scalp looked...dry. Inigo's stomach turned.

"I'll tell them to send down some lotion. Luccione.. I.. have something to ask you. I need to know what our brother is planning," Inigo said, his voice echoing in the vast chamber. "Why is Satoru mobilizing against Osaka? Why is Father retiring?"

Luccione let out a dry, rasping laugh, "It's all for the legacy of the bloodline, isn't it? To preserve the Daiichi."

“You’re starting to sound like Satoru..”

“He and I agree on very few things. Tell me, how will you change things when he’s in charge? A man that’s been carved up to be a replica of Father?“ Luccione's golden eyes glinted. “His only will is to preserve the status quo and enforce it.”

"I don't know... but Satoru's starting to worry me."

“Then let me help you rise to the throne. Free me from this cage and I’ll support your claim. I'll do anything for you Ini-boy."

"Heh. Nice try. I can't trust you. I wish I could, but I can’t let you hurt any more people."

"Yet you come to me for answers? You’ve already beaten me. By the rite of Ryūjin, I should serve under you. As much as I despise what you’ve become, I would rather see the future you create than rot under our elder brother’s thumb. Do think it over.”

“There’s nothing to think about. I’m leaving the family to Satoru, and I’m going to be a hero and save people like Mother did. It’s what I was always meant to do,” Inigo said with conviction. 

“Aww, a few months playing do-gooder at your school and you think you're reformed? My poor naive baby brother, who’s been feeding you such delightful lies? Perhaps I should’ve killed your friends while I had the chance."

“You’ll never get the chance,” Inigo's green dragon appeared at his side, rumbling ominously, but Inigo raised a hand to calm it.

Luccione's sunken eyes fixed on the dragon. "There it is. You pretend it's not there, lurking under the surface. But your true self will emerge soon enough. You can't suppress your inner darkness forever, no matter how many chains you place on it."

Inigo stepped closer, Gigan's emerald light casting eerie shadows across his face. "You tried to kill innocent people."

"Innocent?" Luccione scoffed. "No one is innocent, brother. I simply provided a glimpse of their deepest desires. They were so horrified that they'd rather end their lives. What they did after was their own choice."

"You manipulated them! Twisted their minds for your own amusement."

"And is that so different from what you did back in middle school?" Luccione's gold eyes glinted with malice. "Tell me, when you controlled all your classmates with fear and pain, was it not thrilling? Having that much power over them? Controlling the lives of tortured kids?" Luccione’s eyes glittered.

Inigo faltered. Shame washed over him at the thought of his past self.

Luccione pressed on. "You claim to be reformed, but all you're doing is seeking more. I left you a perfectly good middle school to rule, could’ve even gone to high school with them. But you weren’t satisfied with just ruling them, cause you knew that deep down inside, in their hearts and minds, they hated you. And you couldn’t touch that part of them. Poor little Inigo couldn’t stand the thought of being left out."

"I've changed," Inigo repeated, but uncertainty tinged his voice. Gigan let out a plaintive whine, mirroring his inner conflict.

“Did you? Let’s take, for example, your little dumpling sweetheart.. I saw her by the pond, y’know… Just before I flew away. She was looking for you. Such a strong desire was a bright flame to my quirk.”

“You’ll leave her alone.” A dismembered emerald dragon claw appeared in front of Luccione.

“Or what, you’ll find someone for me to date?” Luccione cackled. “You don’t think I know your little play? Isn’t it funny how you conveniently push people into little pairs? Look how silly and pure it is. You push romance all around like a drug. And it’s all in the name of your shipping game. Leaving her, with no choice - but to go. To. You.”

“That’s not true.”

“Oh, but it is, isn’t it? Does she even want you? Or because you’re convenient? What did you do when she told you about Kwaylee? You take Kwaylee into a salon, maybe pretty her up so the rival, Cristoffy would finally like her. They’ll cancel each other out, right? Then when that didn't work, you might as well invite the Koreans to his hospital bed. Maybe he'll like one of them. They are dispensable after all. They already snagged two eligible bachelors in your class. And because of your little nudges, Kimai, Nouh, and Nenene are off in their own ships. Oh and should I remind you what you did to, Ōootani-senpai? The poor baseball ace didn't even realize he wanted to join that cult until you came along." Luccione shrugged, his eyes gleaming. "So who's left I wonder? No more rivals. Just you? It’s disgusting really. Makes my skin crawl. Poor little Hugi. Only with you because she’s scared to be alone. Because really she has no choice but to be with you, because if she did - she’ll drop you like a 5-year-old printer.”

Inigo anger surged and his dragonclaw smashed Luccione into the wall, drawing a fit of laughter from the imprisoned man. Sharp dragon fingers wrapped around Luccione’s neck. “Hahaha! Kill me then? Do it! Prove me right!”

“You’re wrong! Also, I find it difficult to believe that your quirk doesn’t give you people’s correct names… Those were very dumb names… not even common ones,” Inigo yelled bitterly.

“Give me a break. It was a cold night and we had just fought." Luccione hissed, spitting out blood. "But you know… I’m right, brother. I don’t need my quirk to show you. You can’t hide from yourself.  Did you really think you changed so quickly in less than a year? The miraculous prankster with a heart of gold. It’s all a con you tell yourself - when deep down inside you’re just a filthy greedy little dragon who wants new toys to play with. A dragon collecting a hoard of friends to fill an empty void and doing his best to protect his ill-gotten gains.”

Inigo’s vision darkened and he fell back with his head bowed. 

"We're two sides of the same coin, little brother," Luccione rasped. "One bad day and you'll be right back where you started. With me."

Inigo gazed down at his hands, envisioning the cruelty they were once capable of. He thought of his friends at Shiketsu and the future they represented. Luccione was wrong. He had changed, even if remnants of his past lingered. Straightening his shoulders, Inigo met his brother's stare.

 "I'll never be like you… My friends gave me the strength I needed to break free and become someone better. I owe it to them to uphold that.”

He stepped forward and Gigan reappeared on his shoulder. 

“It may seem like a game to someone like you, who thinks of people like play-things. But they’re individuals with real lives, with their own choices. They’ve shared their dreams with me. I’ve seen them cry and hurt. They comfort each other when times are tough, and work together for a bright future, despite what happened in their past. You underestimate them. They’re not play-things. They’re my friends." 

Luccione scowled. 

Inigo turned to leave the dungeon when Luccione called out. 

"They’ll never accept you. Not with all the blood on your hands."

Inigo slowed, knowing precisely what he meant. But the smiling faces of his classmates, and the laughter of his friends, the image of Hoge's face, her shy smile. They all anchored him. 

"Maybe not," he conceded quietly. "But I have to try." 

Without looking back, Inigo strode from the cell, Gigan trailing protectively behind him. The path ahead would be difficult, but he’d walk the path using the light his friends provided.

##II. The Crushing of UA
>> Recommended song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCHQ6OVNh_M

The northern passage stood as a gloomy theatre, lit by blue globes that threw twisting shadows up the quirk-enhanced walls of the labyrinth. The air thick with the stench of sweat, the tang of quirks and the bitter taste of desperation. Students from across the country had converged in the wide room, united only by their resentment of UA. 

Inigo adjusted his customized Ryu-kishi cap. Why was he thinking of his brother just now? Luccione's mocking words still rang in his ear. He gritted his teeth. He didn't care what his brother said. He’ll become a hero.

Beside him loomed the teen minotaur mutant, Buruburu Buruburu, knuckles white around the shaft of his great axe, beady eyes glinting with bloodlust in the gloom. The two UA students, Raijin and Bubblegum, looked small and afraid beside the hulking teen. Inigo frowned. He didn't know them, but he hated what this exam was doing to people. Together they faced off against an approaching mob.

Raijin adjusted his glasses and the lenses flashed white. “All the high schools around the country compete to pass the provisional licensing exam. Our schools have lost the advantage of no one knowing our quirks.” 

“It’s because UA’s sports tournament is broadcast across the country,” Bubblegum continued for him, feeling tense as her bubblegum-like hair slowly rose up, “They know not just our quirks but also our weaknesses and fighting styles.”

“Heh. So our schools have this weakness going into the exams,” Inigo tightened his grip on his glowing green mallet.

“It’s not fair!” Bubblegum whimpered. “It was like this last year too. It’s become a tradition, the start of the exams is always the crushing of UA!”

“And now Shit-ketsu! Because Ryu-kishi’s school was dumb enough to follow us and have a tournament too.” Buru chuckled. “Here they come!”

Inigo grinned, feeling excited as emerald energy crackled across his body. “Meh, I don't think it matters. Because in the end, it doesn’t change a thing!” He spread his wings and leaped towards the charging crowd of twenty-something students; the three UA students following behind him.

“We'll overcome everything! I have someone waiting for me at the finish line and I won’t be stopped!” Mid-jump Inigo channeled his construct. “120% Full Clowning! Popsy Style!” A full clown regalia appeared on Inigo; rubber balls, marbles, and silly strings appeared with his every move. He dodged a thrown mud spear and swatted away a blue construct beetle with his mallet. 

He had seen the move done a hundred times online - on Popsy's debut fight against Tatarimokke. 

####**“BIG”**

His bellowing shout reverberated through the air. Gigan surrounded Inigo and expanded into a large oblong shape. Quirks lashed through the gloom - fireballs, projectile spikes, whipping vines. 

####**“BOZO”**

Gigan’s size grew enormous, resembling a 90's kid's show parade float. Students began to run away from its giant shadow, some tried to attack.

####**“DRAGON BELLY FLOP!”**

The oversized Gigan fell and crashed like a falling meteor, squashing, confusing, smothering students within its bouncy form. 

Without missing a beat, he snapped his finger, Gigan transformed into a massive skateboard underneath Inigo. "You guys wanna see me do a KICKFLIP!? OKAY!" 

The giant board twisted and flipped under him like a rumbling siege engine, sending enemies flying. Inigo's energy drained fast but he was having fun. Laughing loudly, he turned Gigan into a giant floor spring. The construct flung students into the air, including Inigo who leaped over the crowd and landed next to Buru with a mock bow.

"How was my act, bro?"

"You fight like a damn fool!" Buru yelled.

"It's called having fun," Inigo dodged a vulture boy's swooping talons. His quirk flared and a large cartoon boxing glove uppercutted the mutant flier. "You should try it sometimes."

"Heh! Okay, court jester! We need to push towards that entrance or we'll be overwhelmed!"

Inigo gave a mock salute and grinned. "I gotcha!"

Compared to him and the UA students, the enemy were amateurs, but there were a lot of them. At the very back, Inigo could see a golden-monocled boy directing the mob. It was impossible to get to him. 

They were forced into defending. Inigo switched to his knight armor and mallet. Their small group pushed forward together as the hallway narrowed. With a mighty roar, the two front liners smashed into their foes. The enemies swirled around Inigo and Buru like water around a stone. Pressing in, shoving, voices raised in furious unintelligible babble. Twenty, maybe more, faces twisted with anger, quirks flaring, spittle flying. Inigo stumbled as someone struck him from the back, lurched into another who elbowed him aside with cement block arms, Buru's big hand closing on his shoulder the only thing keeping him upright. The room seemed to spin about him, the faces blurring into one great mask of resentment.

<"UA dogs!"> <"Think you're better than us?"> <"You won't beat us this year!">

Inigo twisted from an ill-aimed blow, lashed out with his hammer, and felt it connect with a satisfying thud and a groan of pain. He glimpsed Buru an arm's length away, bullhead lowered as he fended off a couple of the more enthusiastic ones. "We're almost there! Stay close!" Inigo shouted at him, though he could scarcely hear his own voice over the mindless roaring of the mob. He swung again and sent two students flying. Buru gave no sign of having heard, too busy plowing through the press, scattering bodies left and right like dolls and giving a good impression of an angry bull in a ring of toreadors. He left a trail of groaning and cursing enemies in his wake that were crawling, rolling, lurching up onto quaking legs, ready for another go.

FWOOOM!

Three armored students lurched through the west entrance only to be swept off their feet by a thundercloud created by Raijin. "I'll cover us! Keep going!"

!!! Hero Name:「Raijin」
	Quirk:「Thunder Strand」

	Type: Emitter

	Description: He can turn a strand of his hair into a thundercloud, the longer the strand of hair the more powerful it is! He can control up to three of them at the same time. He's afraid of growing completely bald!

Inigo nodded to Raijin, hopped up onto a table to get some space, the way instantly blocked by a grimacing lad whose arms exploded into whipping vines. Inigo fended him with a large green shield, then rolled out of the way as a girl wearing a welding mask sprayed globs of molten plastic across the table. He tumbled off the far side as it melted, splinters spattering against the back of his neck and catching on his armor. 

Weapons and quirks clashed. A fireball sizzled over Inigo's head and exploded against the wall, the blast nearly bowling him over. Inigo pressed through the melee, the central chamber filled with pure chaos. Barely five yards from the eastern exit, one of the walls shifted and a rift opened. "Now's our chance!" Inigo yelled. The portal trapped shimmered, separating them from the mob of enemies in the room. They used the time to run to the eastern exit.

Ten minutes later, Inigo flew upwards, hammering down an enemy flier with bubble-like wings as they sped through the dark tunnel. They had run into an ambush on their way down the tunnel: Buru and Raijin had looked pretty bad. Bubblegum was helping them walk with her ever-growing pink hair. Inigo flew around her in a protective patrol. 

"More enemies ahead!" grunted Buru weakly, lowering his horns. Through the haze of smoke, Inigo made out three figures blocking their route. A mountain of a girl with spiky green hair. A boy with draconic obsidian wings, and a slender girl wielding a sword. Their eyes glittered with menace in the flashing lights.

Wait. Through the grime and haze, he recognized the tall girl. "Kaylee?"

"You know them, Ryu-kishi?" asked Buru, not lowering his guard.

"These are my classmates! My friends!" Inigo said. "Flying Force, Mirror Devil, and Yako!"

"Oh thank God!" Bubblegum gasped.

Christopher dismissed his arm cannon, relief washing over his exhausted features. "We thought you were more enemies." Inigo's friends from school didn't look too great. Kaylee looked like she was about to give out and Christopher and Chihiro had several bruises. Christopher moved forward and hugged Inigo swiftly.

“Huh?” Inigo blinked twice in surprise at the sudden hug. “Yo! Oh yeah!” He grinned widely. “Black Dragon bro! I love that you’re finally using my quirk, my man. ” He reached out a fist-bump to Chris’ armor and a black dragonclaw pounded him back.

“Shut up! It’s bad enough I have to deal with this damn quirk all exam.” Chris shook and took a firmer stance, sniffing twice.

“Who are those with you?” Kaylee asked suspiciously, looking at the three UA students running towards them.

“They’re on our side. UA students. The crowd’s gone crazy.”

Christopher nodded. “They attacked us out of nowhere. We managed to flee here to regroup.”

“Bro, they're out to crush UA and Shiketsu, since they know our quirks.”

Buru and his classmates arrived and Inigo quickly introduced them to his friends.

“The way behind is blocked. The tunnel's closed,” Chihiro said flatly.

“Damn it!” Raijin glared behind them and glanced at the northern door. “That means..”

“..there’s only one path out of here.” Chris finished for him.

Inigo smirked. “Doesn’t sound too bad now that we’re all here! I’m pumped up! We got enemies chasing us, but we got our  team.”

Buru growled. “One Shit-ketsu was bad enough. Now there’s four of them.”

“Hey! You want to start something?” Kaylee glared at Buru. Buru chuckled as Bubblegum helped him sit down against a wall. “Get in line!”

Christopher shook his head, "We're doing the trials too. This is the best course for us to get our keys."

"I'm ready," said Chihiro, her crackling blade glowed by her waist. She was using the same sword she used during the Shiketsu tournament.

Kaylee cracked her knuckles, "Let's get this over with."

Inigo nodded to his friends as they slowly walked out of the tunnel. "Leave it to us! Let's go Team 1-D!"

Christopher frowned. "That's not our name!"

"How about Team Shiketsu?"
"Too broad."
"Team Christopher?"
"Why me?"
"Team Mitsurugi Dojo!"
"Kaylee's never been there."
"I wasn't invited so.."
"Really?"
"Yeah."
"I had just cleaned the dojo if you want to visit."
"I could stop by."
"Sweet! Yako-san, I wanna show Chris the waterfall!"
"I don't want to go!"
"C'mon, bro! We're throwing a We All Passed party there after this."
"You shouldn't count your chickens before they hatch."
"Who's going to fail? We're all super strong! Team Super!"
"You're too optimistic like always."

"By the way, have you guys seen Hoge?"

Somewhere in the Labyrinth, Maru sneezes inside her helmet.

##III. Labyrinth East Passage

The crowd surged forward in a cacophony of battlecries. Inigo swung his hammer in a wide arc, smashing into the first wave and sending two of them flying. More foes closed in.

He traded blows with a brutish teen wielding a spiked club, each impact ringing through his bones. Inigo ducked a claw swipe from a lizard-like boy and swept his legs out from under him with the mallet.

The UA students were holding their own, lightning crackling as the blue-haired boy zapped any who got close.

The pink-haired girl lashed out with elastic hair, binding two foes together before slamming them to the floor. But the press of enemies was relentless.

Dark construct spheres flew as Christopher shot any who neared with a draconic hand cannon coming out of his own armor, which mirrored Inigo’s knight form.

Kaylee plowed through the mob, tossing foes aside with ease.

Back to back, they weathered the tide, coordinated and seamless. Inigo deflected a fireball with his shield, glimpsed Chihiro lash out in a blur, she swung her blade and disappeared, a swat of enemies dropped to the ground clutching their necks and chests. A tide of enemies still pressed in through the entrance. They had to break out soon or be overwhelmed. A familiar roar drew Inigo's eye. Buru was locked in combat with a hulking beast of a teen, their arms bulging as they strained against each other, teeth bared in primal fury.

 He seemed to have the upper hand, forcing his opponent back step by step, hooves gouging furrows in the floor. Inigo moved to assist, only to see a one-eyed boy in a magician’s outfit level a hand towards Buru from across the room. A strange pulse emanated from his palm.

"Look out!" Inigo yelled in warning, but too late.

Buru's eyes widened momentarily, then narrowed with vicious intent. He grabbed his opponent and hurled him aside like a doll before rounding on Inigo, nostrils flaring.

"The fuck?" Inigo said, raising his mallet warily.

Buru charged Inigo like a maddened bull. Inigo barely managed to sidestep the headlong rush, his friend plowing past and smashing a crater in the wall beyond.

"I thought you were done chasing me for the day, bro," Inigo groaned, glancing back towards the one-eyed boy. His hand was still extended, face tight in concentration.

Some kind of damn mind control. But Inigo didn't have time to ponder it as Buru wheeled around for another pass.

Inigo braced himself. At the last moment, he flew upwards, rolling over the minotaur's thundering charge. As Buru stormed past Inigo lashed out with his mallet, sweeping his friend's legs and sending him crashing face-first to the floor.

"Snap out of it, Buru!" Inigo yelled, rolling smoothly to his feet.

Buru lurched upright with an enraged roar, eyeing Inigo murderously, fists bunching.

Well, crap. Looked like he'd have to knock some sense back into his friend the hard way. Inigo hefted his mallet, circling warily as Buru followed his movements like a predatory beast.

His friend charged again. Inigo deflected the bull's lowered horns with his mallet shaft, turning the momentum aside. He skipped clear of the rebounding charge, lashing out with a kick to Buru's backside for good measure.

"Is that all you've got?" Inigo mocked.

Buru snarled, rounding on him again. As Buru plowed towards him, Inigo waited until the last second, dropped to one knee, his mallet melted unto the floor and formed a spring pad. The spring pad let out a mechanical buzz, lifting Buru clear off his hooves with a sudden snap. Inigo winced in sympathy as his friend flew towards the back of the room and crashed into a group of students.

"Sorry about that, bro. I'll make it up to you!" Now where the hell is that mind-controller freak, he had to get him before-

A sudden tremor ripped through the mob followed by a familiar battle roar. What the hell now? Inigo saw Kaylee standing in front of him, eyes blazing murder.

Inigo didn't have time to find the one-eyed kid before Kaylee was surging towards him like a juggernaut. He raised his mallet defensively, wondering how many friends he'd have to fight today.

Kaylee plowed into him like a sucker punch from a giant, crushing him against the far wall with impossible force. The mallet tumbled from Inigo's grip as he fought for breath, pinned by the elbow across his throat. Her forearm was like a steel girder.

Inigo clawed at it weakly. "Ack... Kaylee! It's me!"

No flicker of recognition in those rage-filled eyes. She drew back a fist brimming with explosive power.

This was going to hurt. Inigo desperately forced his quirk into his armor, reinforcing the greaves just in time. Kaylee's punch crunched into his guard with enormous force, steel crumpling like paper, agony lancing through his arm. Inigo cried out hoarsely, knee driving up and catching Kaylee clean in the midriff. It was like kneecapping a brick wall but it loosened her grip just enough for Inigo to wrench free, rolling clear in agony as rubble cascaded around him.

"If you send me to the hospital, Kaylee! I expect you to visit me too! Don't let Chris read me something long and boring. Maybe something with romance." Inigo quipped while running, but she was on him again in a blur, pummeling him with earth-shattering blows as he created a round barrier around himself.

His barrier shattered and Inigo crashed through a bench, broken tiles clattering around him, lifting his cap to see Kaylee looming over him like judgment personified, wreathed in terrible light. She seized him by the neck and hoisted him up like litter. Inigo saw someone coming out from the crowd.

A flash lit the hall, momentarily blinding. Kaylee snarled in rage and stood dazed. Chihiro had struck Kaylee's eyes with the blunt side of her blade. She blurred forward and repeated several slashing combos on the dazed Kaylee before falling back as the tall girl sent a blast of ki exploding around her.

Inigo rolled away and forced himself up, his broken right arm hanging uselessly. He willed his shattered greave to reform into a shield just as Kaylee spun towards him and unleashed another leveling punch.

It shattered the shield instantly, the force of it popping Inigo's shoulder and flinging him like a rag doll across the hall. He slammed into a drinking fountain, water gushing around him as he slumped against it, head swimming.

Fuck, he'll run out of arms if this kept up. Vision swimming, Inigo peered up to see Christopher shielding Chihiro behind a dark barrier as Kaylee turned on them. He had to do something quick or his friends were dead.

Inigo groggily forced himself up on unsteady legs, leaning against the fountain as the room tilted sickeningly. He glimpsed a flash from across the room - the one-eyed fucker, watching events unfold with a satisfied smirk.

"Of course," Inigo growled under his breath. As Kaylee smashed through Christopher's barrier, Inigo tackled her to the ground in his Bulldozer armor. "The kid with the top hat! He's behind the crowd and controlling her!" He yelled to Chris and Chihiro. "I'm too slow to get him but-"Kaylee cut him off by lifting Inigo overhead, moving to slam him down across her knee. Christopher froze her telekinetically, though his strain was clear.

Inigo twisted free, forming a gauntlet around his good arm. As Kaylee broke the hold, he smashed her down with a ringing cry of "Dragon Smash!" before repeating the blow to keep her occupied.

Chihiro used the opening to dash towards the mind controller in a blur. In a blink, she was halfway across the chamber. Her target shouted in alarm as she closed in and three hulking teens moved to block her, but it was too late. 

Chihiro stopped her dash between them and turned on the spot, spinning like a leaf floating down a river. 'Autumn Lotus', she whispered as all four of her targets fell to the ground.

Kaylee paused as the mind control was broken, blinking around in dazed confusion.

"Welcome back," Inigo said hoarsely, holding his shattered arm with his battered gauntlet.

Kaylee looked at him in dismay. "Shit! Myoga. I'm sorry! Are you-"

"All good. You can just owe me a get bearter bear later." Inigo grinned and winked.

Kaylee turned to face the advancing mob and cracking her knuckles. "Right. These bastards want to play rough?"

The next wave of enemies surged towards them, quirks flaring. Buru rejoined them just in time to charge with Kaylee, "I'll make them regret ever fucking with us!"

With a roar they exploded towards the attackers, moving almost faster than Inigo's eyes could track. The first rows simply vanished, smashed aside like leaves in a tempest. The rest recoiled in sudden fear and uncertainty, but too late. The two powerhouses tore into them like wild beasts, hammering them relentlessly across the chamber.

Inigo winced as bodies tumbled limply past. "Uh, maybe go a little easier?"

They weren’t listening, lost to their fury. Their rampage had given Inigo some space though, a chance to turn the tide. Inigo spotted Raijin and Bubblegum moving across the room.

Together the team plowed into the disoriented crowd nearest the exit, Inigo kicked projectile soccer balls from behind, and Christopher led from the front, conjuring twin dragon gauntlets that savaged any who resisted. Chihiro whirled and danced between them, quick and lithe, lashing out with her crackling blade to lash at enemies and buying them breathing room when the enemy closed in. Step by step they forced their way towards the doorway, as the others followed.

Finally, Buru signaled a halt, raised his fist, and let out a tremendous laugh. The enemy wasn’t chasing them, they were retreating into small groups, some fighting against each other as they fled. 

"Guess they changed their mind." Inigo said.

"Yeah until next year," Buru growled.

"I'd rather not go through that again, Bu-chan." Bubblegum said.

The Crushing of UA was done. Battered and bruised, they all shared a look and cheered alongside Buru. They had won.

***

Inigo's steps faltered as Gigan morphed out of its armor form and flew away. It made an anxious sound, pointing back the way they had come. Inigo sensed it too - a presence in the shadowed tunnel behind them. He turned, peering back into the central chamber.

Christopher peered at him in alarm. "What are you doing?"

“I’ll be back! Go on ahead without me.”

Inigo ran back through the tunnel. He could hear the sounds of small skirmishes in the distance as Gigan’s senses lit the path ahead of him. He crossed into the room and saw that the enemy mob had broken down into small groups, nursing their wounds together. There was no use sneaking around when he was so worn out.

He walked into the room confidently, Gigan transforming into knight armor around him. He loosened the greaves around his injured arms to stifle the ringing pain shooting through them. Following Gigan’s directions, Inigo moved some destroyed debris using construct arms created by Gigan. A large chunk of a wall had been destroyed during the battle.

A small shape lay crumpled against a far wall near the entrance, unnoticed during the clash - a girl with green hair. Blood pooled beneath her where she clung weakly to life.

Seeing the injured girl crumpled and bleeding against the far wall, forgotten in the chaos, Inigo's chest tightened. He rasped, "I need to get her help."

The girl peered up with glazed eyes as his shadow fell over her. Blood bubbled on her lips. Inigo knelt, managing a faint smile. "Hey. I've got you." He wrapped his tattered scarf around her wounds, then gathered her up as gently as he could with one working arm. She whimpered, clutching his damaged jacket with feeble fingers.

Inigo limped back down the corridor, the girl cradled close. His construct Gigan trailed behind, squeaking anxiously.

Inigo carried his fragile burden back towards the tunnels. He didn’t have time to bring her to the others, but there should be active traps nearby, he could send her through the portals where aid was waiting. He ran up a side tunnel, hoping to find one.

##IV. Labyrinth West Passage

Inigo limped through the dim tunnel, the injured girl cradled gently in his one working arm. His steps echoed softly off the carved stone walls as he pressed on. Gigan’s dragon head materialized anxiously in his armor, glancing between Inigo and their fragile cargo, emitting worried squeaks.

"It's okay, buddy," Inigo murmured. "We'll get her help."

He wasn't sure how far he'd come, or if he was even going the right way. Still, there had to be a way out if he kept-

Voices echoed sharply up ahead, accompanied by screams and the electric crackle of quirks. Inigo slowed, edging around the corner cautiously. The tunnel opened into a larger chamber, much of the floor covered by a shimmering blue portal. A handful of students were scattered around it, they were bound and groaning in frustration.

In the center stood a powerfully built hero in dark red and yellow armor, fists crackling with kinetic energy. Inigo's eyes widened. Impakt. The famous German hero was one of the exam challenges.

Impakt seized a student by the shirt and hurled him into the portal. "You were too slow, young hero! You must push yourself harder!" His voice boomed off the stone.

Inigo shrank back into the shadows, mind racing. Impakt was obviously placed here to hinder any students trying to escape. There'd be no reasoning with him. Inigo would have to find another way around.

He turned to leave only for Gigan to block his path, regarding him reproachfully.

"What?" Inigo whispered. "We can't fight Impakt. We need to go around."

Gigan's limbs folded defiantly across its body, floating closer to the chamber entrance.

Inigo glared at the stubborn construct. "Hey, don't give me that! We need to think about the exam."

Gigan's glowing eyes flicked pointedly down to the girl bleeding in Inigo's arm. It let out a defiant squeak.

Inigo sighed, looking down at the pale, struggling girl. Gigan was right. Her life mattered more than the exam.

"Okay, we'll try it your way," he conceded. "But when Impakt clobbers us, I expect an apology and you’re explaining to Hoge why we failed."

Inigo steeled himself and stepped out into the chamber. Impakt turned, a knee raised to kick. "Halt, young hero!" His voice boomed. "I cannot let you pass without testing your hero's mettle!"

Inigo quickly raised the hand holding his tattered white scarf, the bloodstained banner of truce.

"Wait!" he called out. "I'm not here to fight! This girl needs medical help!"

Impakt paused, staring at them intently. Inigo felt the weight of those judging eyes. After a moment, the hero strode forward.

Impakt placed two armored fingers against the girl's neck, frowning. "Her monitor is damaged. We didn't know she was injured." He fixed Inigo with a piercing gaze. "How do I know you didn't harm her yourself and carried her to get through me?"

Inigo met his stare evenly. " I only want to help her. I’ll stay here to prove it."

Impakt considered him a moment longer before scooping up the girl with unexpected care.

"Please," Inigo added exhaustedly, "Get her aid."

Impakt nodded. "Very well, young hero. I will return shortly."

Before Inigo could respond, the hero stepped into the shimmering portal and vanished. The remaining students edged away from Inigo warily.

Inigo slumped against the cool stone wall, exhaling shakily. Gigan nuzzled his cheek in concern. He gave the miniature dragon a weary pat.

"We did the right thing. She'll be okay now." At least, he hoped so. Impakt would surely get her proper care. All Inigo could do was wait. Inigo's thoughts turned to Impakt. He had researched the famous German hero after the Boys witnessed him battle Drekus several months back. Impakt's history was inspiring - he had lost his famous father at a young age and had big shoes to fill. Impakt had trained relentlessly to master his quirk and accepted the call to become a hero.

While some criticized his blunt attitude, Inigo admired his strong convictions and refusal to compromise. Impakt believed in justice, not glory. He was the type of hero Inigo aspired to be - one who helped people not for fame or reward, but because it was right. In a way, his story felt similar to Inigo’s own legacy.

He wasn't sure how much time passed. His exhaustion threatened to overwhelm him, but he forced his eyes to stay open.

Finally, the portal shimmered again and Impakt emerged, his expression unreadable behind the visor.

Inigo pushed himself off the wall. Had Impakt verified his story? Would he let Inigo pass or brand him a liar?

The pro-hero strode up to him, eyes blazing behind his helmet. Inigo stood tall, ready to plead his case or defend himself.

Impakt leaned in close and murmured, "That was a noble deed. But now I must do my job and serve as your obstacle." He whispered even quieter, placing a hand over his ear. “I’ll show you a display of my mächtiger aufwärtshaken! But should you feint to the right and roll under my strike. It would be difficult for me to recover.” He winked and stepped back, raising his voice. "You shall not pass me!"

Inigo blinked in surprise before realizing this was for show. He nodded almost imperceptibly and raised his guard, playing along. "I won't let you stop me, Impakt!"

Impakt lunged forward with a roar, unleashing a devastating uppercut. Following the instructions, Inigo swayed aside just in time, the wind from the blow ruffling his hair. As Impakt overextended past him, Inigo dropped into a roll, sprang up, and took off down a side passage.

"Curse you!" Impakt bellowed after him. "You may have escaped this time, but we will meet again!"

Inigo allowed himself a small smile as he limped away. Impakt was letting him go. The hero's trust and mercy meant more than winning any fight. It gave Inigo hope he was on the right path after all.

##IV. Labyrinth West Chamber

Inigo soon rejoined the others. They took a break in a small chamber to catch their breath and heal. Christopher leaned against a wall, his coat torn in several places as his little black dragon sat quietly on his shoulder. Chihiro sat on the ground, breathing quietly as she cleaned her blade. Kaylee paced back and forth impatiently, casting angry glares at the empty hallways stretching out before them.

Inigo stood quietly to the side, observing the others.  On the opposite side of the chamber, Raijin sat beside the pink-haired girl, Bubblegum. 

Letting out a dejected sigh, Inigo broke the silence. “Well, I'm feeling pretty roughed up but we got an exam to finish. Any luck with finding a key, guys?”

Finishing up with Raijin’s wounds, Bubblegum turned. “We got two keys for me and Raijin,” She held up her gleaming red key, turning it over in her hands. 

Cracking her knuckles, Kaylee growled, “I took one from a large fella in the other chamber.”

“I'll find one on the way with Kaylee” Christopher added flatly. 

"We should get moving," Kaylee said gruffly. "Still a long way to the exit."

Inigo nodded. "You're right. I should let you guys get to the finish line. Good luck bro! See you on the other side, alright?"

Christopher gave Inigo a pat on the shoulder. "You too, man. Good luck."

They waved goodbye as Chris, Kaylee, Bubblegum and Raijin took off down the maze. Inigo was glad his friends already had their keys. Now he just needed to secure his own. He noticed two others still lingering. It was Chihiro and Buru.

Chihiro fidgeted with her sword. "I haven't been able to find a key."

"My classmates should be safe now that we broke up that group. I'm not gonna leave without you, bug!" Buru said, pounding his chest. "Let's grab a key and get out of here."

Inigo grinned, happy that he wasn't alone. "You got it! Let's do this together."

“There’s a place called the Red Zone here in the maze,” Buru said. “I overheard the other UA students talking about it. Should be located in the northernmost corner of the labyrinth. The keys there are heavily guarded by powerful foes.”

Chihiro nodded. "It's a good place to start. Lead the way Bull-sama."

##V: The Red Zone

Inigo, Buru and Chihiro moved through the labyrinth, avoiding traps and skirting around opposing groups along the way.

Injured and battered, they carried on forward through the winding tunnels.  The tunnels grew tighter, the walls closing in around them until they were forced to proceed single file. Buru took the lead, horns lowered cautiously as he sniffed the air. Chihiro followed close behind, one hand on her sword, alert for any sign of danger. Inigo brought up the rear, Gigan hovering worriedly at his shoulder.

After what felt like an eternity of trudging down the dim passage, a distant rumbling met their ears. Buru paused, raising a hand to halt them. The rumbling grew louder, accompanied by a faint vibration through the stone floor.

"Something's coming," Buru rumbled.

Inigo and Chihiro exchanged an apprehensive look. Whatever it was, in these tight confines they'd have little room to maneuver.

"Be ready for anything," Inigo said, willing Gigan to form a shield on his arm.

The rumbling intensified, the tunnel shaking around them. A cacophonous grinding echoed down the passage. Buru tensed, lowering his head defensively.

With a deafening crunch, the tunnel wall to their left exploded inwards. Chihiro leaped back with a startled cry as an enormous stone sphere burst through, nearly flattening her. Larger than a bus, the massive boulder filled the tunnel, carving a path of destruction towards them.

"Look out!" Inigo yelled. They turned and ran, the boulder rumbling close behind. It smashed into the walls and ceiling as it rolled, raining debris down on them.

"Faster!" Buru bellowed. But the tunnel was too narrow, leaving them no room to evade the rampaging sphere. Chihiro might be able to outrun it but she'd wear herself out running all the way back. Inigo risked a glance back. The boulder loomed, barely ten feet behind, about to grind them into paste. His mind raced.

No choice. "We gotta hit it!" Inigo yelled.  

"I'm ready when you are!" Buru growled. Chihiro nodded in response, pausing to take a stance as she was ahead of the boys.

"GIGAN!" Inigo roared as he turned around, a field of emerald pikes exploded from the floor, shattering as the boulder ran into them with a crunch, but succeeding in slowing it down. He recalled his quirk and formed a spiraling lance. "CRASH DRAGON DRILL!" Inigo slammed the spinning tip into the mechanized boulder, behind him Buru leaped, his two-handed axe held above his head as he swung down hard! "BURU SMASH!" Chihiro ran up Inigo's back and unto Buru's as she flashed forward, slashing six times in a criss-cross pattern. "Crimson Falling Blossoms." She whispered as she sheathed her sword.

For a moment, nothing happened, and then the boulder shattered into pieces in front of them.

"Ha! They didn't have that last year," Buru bellowed.

Chihiro gazed at the shattered rock, nodding in approval. "Well done."

Inigo managed a weak chuckle. "At least we'll be ready for the next one."

Together they ventured deeper into the sprawling labyrinth, after passing through a maze of mirrored halls that distorted their sense of direction, the group found themselves entering a massive, arena-like chamber. Strange symbols and geometric shapes adorned the high walls and vaulted ceiling. Across from them, an arched doorway beckoned, though it was currently sealed by a shimmering energy barrier.

Squinting, Inigo could make out a raised platform in the chamber's center. Atop it sat a hulking figure cloaked in shadow. But strangely, other shapes seemed to be moving around it. Inigo realized it was a group of students already locked in fierce combat with the shadowy giant.

One of the students went flying, crashing heavily to the ground near where Inigo's group entered. As the dazed boy struggled up, clutching his side, Inigo recognized him - the golden monocled boy from earlier.  Which meant his companions still valiantly battling the central foe had to be...

"It's those bastards who encircled us before," Buru growled, lowering his horns.

Inigo remained silent, watching the uneven fight unfold. The group was clearly outmatched by whatever they faced, barely fending off devastating blows from the obscured central figure. Despite their past animosity, he couldn't stand by while others suffered. Mind made up, he turned to his companions.

"I know they're our enemies, but they're still just students like us. We should help them."

Buru looked at him incredulously. "Help them? After everything they've done?"

Inigo met his friend's gaze evenly. "C'mon! We're heroes right?"

The minotaur scowled but offered no further argument.

Chihiro simply nodded. "The true test of character is how one treats their enemies."

Inigo grinned. "I knew you'd understand, Yako-sama."

Without another word, the trio strode into the chamber toward the chaotic melee. As they neared, the hulking figure dominating the platform came into clear view. Inigo's eyes widened. It was a colossal mechanized samurai, twelve feet tall, its metal body engraved with ornate designs. Four arms bristling with blades and saws jutted from its sides. Its head slowly swiveled between combatants, green optical sensors brightening.

This had to be the Guardian - the final obstacle guarding the keys. And it looked like the other team was on the verge of defeat facing it alone.

One of them cried out, a girl with a welding mask, as she was swatted aside, crashing heavily towards them. Inigo formed a large baseball mitt and caught her. Her wide, fearful eyes fixed on them as she recognized who they were.

"Y-you!" she stammered.

Inigo gave her a reassuring smile. "Relax, we're here to help! Not ambush you." He set her down and flew up the platform towards the monocled-boy. "Yo! You're the leader here right? Remember us?"

"Damn it, Shiketsu! Can't you see we're busy dying!" the boy yelled up at him.

"We were looking for this guardian too," Inigo gestured. "How about a temporary truce?"

"Fine! Proposal accepted!" the boy answered in a panic.

"Good! I'm Inigo by the way!"

"I'm Kinji! Now help us!" He said as he swept his hand over the samurai causing it to jerk violently to the right.

!!! Hero Name:「Kinji」
	Quirk:「Muscle Memory」

	Type: Emitter

	Description: He can plant memories into muscles or muscle-like materials. He can cause spastic reactions when he removes them. By implanting memories into his own muscles he can augment his movements. The golden monocle he wears allows him to track down implanted muscle memories.

Inigo glanced at his companions and landed next to them. "You guys ready for this?"

Buru pounded a fist against his palm. "Was born ready."

Chihiro simply nodded, hand resting on her sword hilt.

Inigo took a deep breath. "Okay. Let's do this. - CRASH KICK!" A large soccer ball struck the samurai from the side causing it to turn towards Inigo.  With surprising speed it leapt down from its platform, landing with an earth-shaking thud before the trio. One massive hand reached back and drew an oversized katana from the sheath across its shoulders.

**"Additional intruders detected,"** it intoned in a grating, robotic voice. **"Increasing combat level."**

Inigo grinned. "We'll be taking those keys. Don't suppose you'll hand them over peacefully?"

The mech rotated its torso towards him, looking down impassively. Servo motors whined as it raised its sword.

**"Request denied. Let battle commence."**

"Thought so." Inigo pointed forward. This is what they trained for. "You guys know the play."

As Kinji's team retreated, Buru bellowed a war cry and charged straight at the Guardian head-on. Chihiro darted to the side, disappearing in a blur of speed. Inigo took flight, soaring up as Gigan formed armor along his limbs.

Their synchronized assault began.

The Guardian whirled with shocking speed, its katana slicing towards the charging Buru. Buru countered with a brutal punch to the mech's torso that left a sizeable dent.

Chihiro utilized the distraction, zipping past the Guardian's legs and delivering a series of blinding rapid strikes to its knee joints before blurring away. Sparks flew from the points of impact.

Inigo dove from above while the robot was staggered, Gigan transforming mid-flight into a massive hammer. He brought it down with all his strength onto the Guardian's sword-arm. Armor crunched under the blow. The katana tumbled from its frozen grip, clattering across the floor.

The trio regrouped, pressing their perceived advantage. But the Guardian wasn't finished yet. With a burst of compressed air it jettisoned itself backward, ejecting broken plating from its damaged limbs. New armor sections slid forward to reinforce its body. It straightened to its full height, eyes flashing ominously as all four arms presented gleaming buzzsaws.

**"First phase complete. Now initializing full combat mode."**

Uh oh. Looked like they just pissed it off.

The Guardian stomped towards them, saw-arms whirring. Buru and Inigo moved to flank it while Chihiro readied another high-speed attack. But before they could strike, the floor abruptly jerked into motion beneath their feet. Segmented sections began rotating clockwise like massive cogs, forcing the trio to fight for balance. With the added challenge of navigating the unstable terrain, their coordination suffered. The Guardian seized the opportunity, laying down a blistering assault that brought Buru to the ground.

Inigo moved to strike with his lance. But before he could strike, the mech's eyes flashed red.

KLAKOOOOM!

With a thunderous boom, all the lights in the arena cut out, plunging the chamber into absolute darkness. Inigo froze, blinded. The whirring of the samurai's saws seemed to come from everywhere at once in the void. His heart thundered in his ears. The whirring of the samurai's saws seemed to come from everywhere at once - SHUNK SHUNK SHUNK - surrounding him, trapping him.

"Status update!" Inigo yelled, cursing the waver in his voice. "Where is it?"

"I can't see a damn thing!" Buru bellowed back, sounding far away.

The shrieking blades grew closer. Green optics flashed demonically in the void, casting sickly illumination across gleaming metal limbs thirsty for blood. Inigo backpedaled, thoughts racing.

This damn robot would slice them to ribbons in this darkness. They had to regroup, but how? The saws' screaming drew closer, promising a grisly end - SHRIEEEK! He dove right as a blade split the air where he stood a moment before. Sparks erupted, briefly revealing the hulking mechanized horror looming over him. 

SHUNK SHUNK SHUNK

Oh god, it was right there! Inigo scrambled away, nearly losing bladder control as the saws ripped along the floor in pursuit - SCRAAAAAPE! No escape from this metal beast. He had to take flight, get some distance. But with no visual references in the suffocating dark, he quickly lost control, crashing upside down into a wall with a hard thud.

"Chihiro! Buru! Kinji!" Inigo shouted desperately. "Where are you?!"

SHUNK SHUNK


No response. The sounds of shrieking metal and buzzing blades drowned out his ally's calls. Were they already down? Sent back to the start somehow? He had to do something!

The damned whirring grew closer...closer...Inigo focused, morphing his gauntlet into a large shield. The saws were nearly upon him - SHUNK SHUNK! At the last instant, he raised his guard to block a blistering overhead chop. The force of it drove him down, shield grinding loudly against the whirling death instruments.

SHUNK SHUNK

He couldn't last like this! Inigo poured his strength into his shield, forcing the saws back through sheer desperate effort. With a final defiant roar, he kicked out, launching the samurai away. It crashed across the arena - CLANG!

But the sounds of grinding gears and whirring blades were already approaching again. This demonic machine would not stop until they were all defeated. Unless...they worked together.

SHUNK SHUNK

"Everyone sound off!" Inigo yelled into the dark. "We have to coordinate!"

The samurai's green optics suddenly snapped on right in front of Inigo, casting an eerie glow. He yelped and stumbled back as one of its saw arms sliced through his leg. Pain flashed across his senses. FOCUS!

Inigo took flight, barely avoiding another swipe. Careful not to crash again. Chihiro cried out somewhere to his left before the sound was drowned out by screeching metal.

"It's right behind me!" he shouted desperately. "Anyone?!"

No response except the whirring blades growing closer...closer...

Then - "I'm here!" Chihiro's voice cut through the darkness. "It's coming from your left!"

Inigo immediately rolled left, evading another blistering chop - SWISH! 

He called on his quirk and chains came out of his wings. Attaching themselves to the mech.

"Strike it to my right!" he bellowed.

Chihiro hurtled from the void, guided by his voice. Her sword sliced through the air - SHING! Sparking off the samurai's armor.

It stumbled from the blow - CREEEEK!

"I'M COMING IN!" Buru's roar echoed across the arena. Heavy footsteps pounded as he charged blindly towards the sounds - BOOM BOOM!

Inigo pressed the advantage, bashing his shield arms into the teetering machine - THUD!

"HERE! It's staggered!" he shouted. "Together now! It's on the ground!"

Buru plowed into the samurai like a wrecking ball - BOOM! 

At the same instant, Chihiro's blade carved through its torso in an arc - SHUNKKRASH!

The machine erupted in a shower of sparks and shrapnel! Its torso crashed to the ground, legs still swaying. Buru grabbed them and heaved the samurai into the air, roaring in defiance. It crashed down in a sparking, twisted heap.

As the screeching and crashing faded, light gradually returned. Inigo met Chihiro's eyes and grinned in relief. Though darkness sought to divide them, together they had prevailed.

The room lit up again and the rotation ceased with a heavy thud. They had done it! Inigo sank to his knees in exhaustion. Chihiro stood atop the motionless Guardian, wiping her blade calmly. Buru picked himself up with a grumble, clutching his injured shoulder. 

As everyone caught their breath, Kinji walked over and offered Inigo a hand up. "Thanks for the help, Ryu-Kishi. You came through."

Inigo took it with a grateful smile. "Couldn't have done it without you guys."

Their attention shifted to the key cards lying scattered next to the Guardian. There were exactly four. Chihiro had already picked one up and was admiring it curiously.

Kinji rubbed his hands together. "Oh man, I can taste that license already!"

The other students, all six of them, moved forward despite their injuries. They looked at each other. Inigo felt tensions rising. Each of them had fought hard. No one wanted to leave empty-handed.

Inigo saw the growing mistrust in their eyes. Without warning, everyone dived for the keys. Bodies collided as they wrestled and grappled. Cries of "It's mine!" and "Let go!" filled the chamber.

Chihiro backed away, overwhelmed by the commotion. Buru tried fruitlessly to separate the combatants. 

"Enough!" Inigo yelled, his voice amplified and commanding. All eyes turned to him in surprise. He rarely used this tone, but the situation demanded it. It reminded him of his eldest brother, Satoru.

"We just succeeded by working together! And now you want to tear each other apart?" Inigo chastised. He gazed around the room, meeting each person's eyes.

"There's not enough keys here for everyone, and we're all tired. If we fight, we all lose. I know you want to pass and get your license. Well, so do I! The only way that happens is if we act like the heroes we're trying to become." 

The groups hesitated, his words sinking in. Inigo pressed on. "The way I see it, this place has enough challenges to keep us from passing without us tearing each other apart, and the best thing we could do is try to get as many of us licenses because the real enemy is the villains outside this labyrinth. If we can come together to beat that guardian, there's no limit to what we can do. Hell, we can take on several guardians and get everyone a key."

A tense moment passed. Finally, Kinji sighed and stepped forward. "He's right! We're better than this." He turned and addressed the rest. "Let's stop acting like kids. Like the guy said, we get the keys and get out of here as a team. No more fighting each other. Agreed?"

"We all cross together with a key, or none of us do." Inigo said, "What's it going to be?"

Murmurs of assent rose up. One by one, they nodded their heads and made peace. Inigo let out a relieved breath. They just might pull through after all!

With peace restored, the unlikely team gathered the four keys and prepared to head for the exit. 

##VI: Labyrinth Northern Passage

Inigo's small band moved through the twisting maze, overcoming each trap and challenge through teamwork and grit. But it was not easy going.

In one low, narrow tunnel, they encountered a series of mechanized dolls that shot out plumes of fire. They stumbled through the haze of dust, lungs burning with more red key cards, bodies aching but spirits high from their narrow victory. Each trial only strengthened them. Inigo found himself taking more of a leadership role, devising strategies to overcome the maze's deadly twists. The others followed his plans readily. Bit by bit, they became a tighter unit.

When they encountered rival groups, Inigo offered mercy and cooperation first. Those who persisted in aggression met swift defeat. After each skirmish, Inigo extended hands of friendship to the fallen foes. To his surprise, most accepted. Their band grew steadily in number and strength.

By the time they neared the maze's end, Inigo led a motley crew of eighteen students. To keep everyone in line, Inigo relied on Kinji, Buru, Chihiro, and a ninja girl named Tsuga, who joined them after defeating a group of ninjas. United by hardship, they pushed through as one. None dared cross their path.

"Never seen such an odd mix work together so well," Buru chuckled as they defeated another trap.

Inigo smiled. "Don't need to share the same school to be bros, right?" 

Against the odds, they secured eighteen keys between them. All would have the chance to pass if they stuck together. And the end was close. Victory awaited just ahead! But as they entered the large antechamber before the doorway, their hopes were dashed. Inigo's scouts reported bad news - the pro hero Impakt was on their trail, likely sent by the organizers to intercept them. The powerful hero would arrive in minutes to block their escape.

Inigo and his trusted friends gathered to assess the dire situation. They spoke using Tsuga's telepathic link.

!!! Hero Name:「Tsuga」
	Quirk:「Relay」

	Type: Emitter

	Description: She can telepathically link familiar targets together allowing them to send messages instantly with their minds. She can link foes together to cause confusion.

<Were you able to gather any useful intel on the heroes' approach?> Inigo asked urgently.

Tsuga shook her head. <It's as we feared. Impakt is on the warpath, just two chambers behind us. We have minutes at best before he arrives.>

<He’s targeting us, that's cheating! We didn't break any rules!> Buru grunted.. 

<Guess they're mad we teamed up this hard, bro.>

<I'll crush him!>

<Even you must admit the odds are poor,> Kinji said. <A pro-hero at 100% against our ragged band? I admire your spirit, but we need cunning now.>

Inigo frowned as he nursed his broken arm. Kinji had a point. A straight clash would only end in defeat. They needed a plan but Impakt’s fearsome reputation made the path ahead seem hopeless.

Chihiro turned to her companions. <Could we avoid him?>

Tsuga shook her head. <Unlikely. The maze behind us has shifted, cutting off any retreat.>

Inigo's shoulders slumped. With no way back and the heroes ahead, they were trapped. Unless...a spark of inspiration hit him.

The students had one advantage against the pro-heroes. Maybe.

<Alright alright, I think I got a plan.> Inigo said, grinning.

Tsuga's eyes widened as she grasped Inigo's proposed plan. They can all still pass. A glimmer of hope shone on the group's faces.

With Impakt rapidly approaching, they worked quickly to enact Inigo's desperate gambit. 

***
***

A sudden tremor shook the labyrinth, forcing the combatants apart. With a flash of light, the pro hero materialized amidst the fray - the explosive Impakt.The organizers must have deemed their army too disruptive.

"None shall pass!" Impakt bellowed. "Unless you can prove your worth, young heroes!"

Before Inigo could appeal to them, Impakt crashed into their frontliners.  With a combo of kicks and hooks he scattered Inigo's team. Inigo seethed, but restrained his anger. Fighting the pro directly would only make things worse. 

Inigo barely avoided a crushing blow from Impakt as his barrier shattered from the man's elbow drop.

Kinji enhanced his legs with his quirk and leaped away from a charging Impakt. <What's the plan, Ryu-kishi? We're getting slaughtered here!>

Buru roared as he staggered to his feet. <Not sure how many more hits we can take, bug!>

Inigo steeled his nerves, there's no way they could win without losing more than half of their team. <We go for it. This is the only way we don't lose anyone. We all need to pass.>

Chihiro frowned but nodded. Inigo hated the plan. But if he could remove even one threat, hope remained.

<Everyone get in position.>

With roar, his team encircled the pro-hero. Impakt swatted at Buru as the minotaur slammed into his leg. Inigo transformed Gigan into an injured brown-headed boy and placed his construct in Impakt's path. The German hero barreled forward like a wrecking ball and swung. The hero pulled his punch, but Gigan stepped into it, his build-up of kinetic energy caused the simple jab to hit like a truck. The false student fell, his chest seemingly caved in. 

Impakt paused in surprise.

Inigo didn't believe the construct alone would convince Impakt he had hurt one of them, but he had instructed the others to play their part. 

They all stopped attacking. 

As the disguised construct coughed blood, the other kids cried out horrifically, playing their role flawlessly. Two girls even burst into tears.

"What did you do!?!" "You killed him!" "Murderer!" "He was just a kid!"

Convinced, Impakt collapsed over the fake body in anguish. "Huh? No no no! This can't be! HEY! KID! WAKE UP!"

After running into Impakt with the Boys. Inigo had done his research on the European hero. He knew about the hero's tragic past. Not just about his father, but distinctly, the two best friends he had when he first debuted as a hero. There were photos of them as hero students and as rookies. They were his own version of The Boys. Always smiling. Sadly, Impakt lost both his friends early in his career. It was a trauma that cut deep. Something Inigo had just used. 

*You know who he looks like don't you, Impakt-sama?*

Impakt fled through a portal with the 'body', screaming for help. Cheers filled the room as the pro-hero left with what he thought was an injured student. Inigo's insides churned. This wasn't very heroic. But he didn't have a choice. He had promised that everyone would pass. And they had worked so hard to get this far. Impakt would get over it once he realizes what happened. Right?

As the others celebrated around him, Inigo could swear he heard Luccione laughing. Deep inside. Were they truly alike? Inigo dismissed the thought. He had a team counting on him and an exam to finish.

##VI: North Exit Chamber

They all hailed from an up-and-coming school in Tokyo called Toguro Academy. Buruburu called them parasites - upper years who extorted passage fees each exam. Once Inigo might've admired such cunning. Now the thought left a bitter taste.

Inigo's eyes narrowed. The high-arched exit stood blocked by stone and twisted metal. A dozen Toguro High seniors paced behind the barricade, costumes faded, gazes hard.

He glanced back at his companions in the shadowed tunnel - ragged, but united after their long struggle. Inigo's jaw tightened. He wouldn't let them fail at the final hurdle.

He noticed a line of younger students standing nearby, gazing hopelessly at the blocked exit. Inigo felt bad for them. They had struggled through the maze only to have their prize snatched away at the end. Inigo strode over to them.

"Yo, listen! We're going to attack the ones blocking the exit" Inigo said, drawing their attention. 

The students stared back with uncertainty. Inigo pressed on.

"I know you're all tired out. "We could use your help. If we succeed, we all get through. It's better than standing around here and failing, right? Join us!"

The students glanced at each other. A few stepped forward, resolve hardening their faces. Inigo smiled. He signaled for Tsuga and Kinji to bring them in. As he rallied more to join his cause, a familiar voice called out.

"Myoga! Over here!"

Inigo turned to see Kaylee waving at him from the crowd, Christopher's unmistakable form looming behind. A wide grin flashed across Inigo's face.

Pushing through the gathering students, Inigo bumped fist with Christopher.

"Bro! You guys made it!" Inigo said thickly.

Christopher nodded. "You look like crap."

Inigo laughed and turned to Kaylee. "You guys get keys?"

"Yeah. We were about to hit the exit with just the two of us, but do you have a better plan?"

"Sorta." 

He quickly shared his plan. Kaylee and Christopher simply nodded.

***
Crouching with his makeshift war council, Inigo spoke quietly.

“We have to them hard and fast.”

Christopher frowned. “A frontal assault would be dumb. We should find another path.”

Inigo nodded. “Exactly. Or if we can't find another path. We'll make one.”

He points to a construct map formed by Gigan.  

"Right here."

Kaylee considered a moment, then grunted. "You're planning on breaking the labyrinth wall? It's almost impossible. I got halfway to busting one down when I stopped. It's not worth the stamina.”

Inigo closed his eyes, visualizing the broken wall, picturing the watchful sentries prowling behind their makeshift ramparts. They would need all their speed and strength once inside.

"Don't worry about destroying the wall, we'll save our strength for the battle."

He outlined his strategy again for the others. A covert team infiltrates the barricade from behind through the wall. A distraction at the front to draw attention. And finally, an attack from both sides to shatter the enemy’s hold.

His companions took in the scheme. Kaylee slammed a fist into her palm with a feral grin. Christopher simply nodded, his doubts assuaged. Lastly, Chihiro, her emotionless dark eyes unreadable as always, laid a hand on the map and whispered. “Let's go.”
***
***
Inigo’s pulse quickened. The time had come. He left Kinji and Buru in command of the frontal assault, trusting them to play their part. The 1-D team delved into the shadowed veins of the labyrinth once more.

The twisting tunnels seemed to squeeze the breath from his lungs. To distract his thoughts from the oppressive dark, Inigo glanced back at his companions. Christopher took up the rear, Kaylee plowing ahead, ready for battle, shoulders hunched in the confines of the passage. And Chihiro darting lithe as a cat through the maze.

At last, Chihiro signaled a halt, she pointed to the labyrinth wall which blocked their side passage.

"So what's the plan with the wall?" Christopher asked.

"He's my plan. Bro's already here!" Inigo grinned.

Out of the shadows, a short brown-haired boy in a martial arts uniform stepped towards them, alongside a white-haired girl with cat-like features.

"Inigo-san!" Kaga called out, performing a bow in front of them alongside the girl, Hyōtetsu.

"Fight Man! Hyōtetsu!" Inigo bumped fist with the shorter teen. He turned towards the others. "I found them in the line before meeting you guys. They need to get through also."

Kaylee started laughing. "The small fry? What're they gonna do?" Kaga looked peeved at being called small. Kouchan hissed at the remark.

 Christopher adjusted his glasses.  "I've seen you in the tournament. You can break the wall?"

Kaga nodded. "I've been training for this. My late master taught me his secret technique."

Hyōtetsu placed a clawed hand on Kaga's shoulder. "Kaga-kun, are you sure? 1-D's crazy is spreading to you."

Kaga gives the catgirl a confident nod.

Inigo half-raised a fist. "I believe in him! You can do it! Leave everything to us afterwards!"

"Ganbatte," Chihiro uttered from the back.

Kaga grinned and cracked his knuckles, eyes blazing. "I can breach it...just need to charge my quirk first. I'll need your help."

At Inigo's signal, his allies surrounded Kaga and unleashed their Quirks. Kaylee pushed hard against the diminutive teen, each press magnifying Kaga's growing exhaustion. Chihiro and Hyōtetsu swung blade and claws, making Kaga dive and roll repeatedly. Inigo and Christopher created an obstacle course for Kaga to struggle through. Bit by bit, Kaga was pushed to his utter limits.

Finally, swaying and trembling, Kaga stepped towards the wall. His band cheered him on, ready to surge through the opening. Hyōtetsu stood staunchly at his side, radiating quiet confidence in him. The walls were reinforced by advanced quirks. But Kaga stepped forward. With a primal roar, Kaga smashed his fist against the stone with all his enhanced might.

The wall cracked violently under the thunderous blow. Fissures spiderwebbed out as chunks rained down. With a final sharp crack, the way collapsed entirely. The unbreakable walls were destroyed. The path ahead was open!

As the group cheered behind him, Kaga stood victorious for a heartbeat. He smiled before his eyes rolled back and he collapsed. Hyōtetsu gently picked him up. "I'll take care of him. You all go on ahead!"

Leaving Kaga in Hyōtetsu's care, they moved through the side passage.

**Gigan POV**

The big stone room was soooo wide and long, with tall walls and pillars reaching up to the glassy ceiling far above. Gigan fluttered about curiously, peeking here and there. This place was like a great big playground!

There were flickering portals on the walls that looked fun to sit in. And pretty blue bulbs giving light everywhere. Ooooh, and metal doors at the back with blinking card sensors! Those were the exits! Gigan wanted to boop the doors. Maybe later, focus on the task!

In the middle of the room was a tall stone tower. At the top, some people were tied up. They looked bored. Gigan wanted to fly up and bonk them on the head to surprise them! See if they need help. But he had to go back to Inigo soon.

"Heeeey! Wait for me!"

Gigan whirled to see a black dragon bounding after him - Christopher's annoying construct! 

"I wanna explore too!" the black dragon pleaded. Before Gigan could react, she shot through one of the blue bulbs. With a pop it reappeared far above, neck craning down.

"Wow, that was fun! You try!"

Gigan wagged a stern claw at its companion. "Stop! We have a task to do, you can be quiet or go back!" They had to focus on scouting!

 The black dragon drooped, crest falling. "Aww, sorry! I just wanted to have some fun together. We're never alone like this." She fluttered next to Gigan with big sad eyes. "I'll be good now, I promise!"

Gigad huffed and drifted silently above, turning back to the scene with eyes that were not eyes. It was little more than a projection right now, a wispy construct shaped from his master’s quirk. Even so, it was more than enough to serve as eyes and ears for Inigo.

There were sixteen enemies that Gigan could see, all strong-looking, milling about in loose groups of three or four. Most were gathered near the base of the barricades, close to their captives. They carried an assortment of weapons, some were support-made and others formed out of their quirks. It fluttered above them unseen, watching and listening.

Here and there students cast wary looks up at the glassy ceiling, but none marked Gigan’s presence. Three older students stood out from the rest. They had positioned themselves evenly around the platform and were clearly directing the others. The leaders. Gigan studied them closely and relayed the details back to Inigo.

The tallest was a broad-shouldered boy with skin of jagged stone, his mouth a lipless gash. Heavy fists that ended in rocky knobs swung at his side, at the end of arms thick as tree trunks. A fitting mutation to go with his brutal looking club carved from black iron.

Opposite him was a slender girl in a red jacket, her exposed arms and shoulders were covered in shimmering red scales, with a ridge of spikes running down her spine. A long reptilian tail swayed behind her, tipped with wicked looking barbs. Short horns poked up through her wild mane of black hair. She toyed with a shimmering spear by her side as she stood poised on the balls of her feet. 

The last leader leaned against a pillar, picking at his nails with a small knife. He was as tall as Kaylee, but with bulging muscles rippling through his steel-gray bodysuit. He has a strange aura around him that scared the others. 

Gigan marked where the leaders were standing. 

"Check out Ms. Spiky over there with the spear!" the black dragon mewed excitedly. "I like her scaly jacket. Do you think she'd let me try it on? Oh! Oh!"

Before Gigan could react, the reckless dragon zipped straight toward the platform! Gigan tackled her just in time, nearly blowing their cover.  Gigan gave its companion an exasperated look ."This is not playtime! This mission is too important!"

The black dragon drooped. "Sorry sorry, I just got over-excited. Friends again?"

It nuzzled Gigan apologetically. Gigan turned away, taken aback. "B-baka! Let's just go back! They're waiting for us." 

The black dragon protested. "But I want to stay! Ten more minutes?" The black dragon whined in protest as Gigan dragged it down into the tunnel. He wanted to explore more too! But they had lingered long enough. Then he zoomed back down the tunnel as fast as his wings could go. 

Gigan needed to return to Inigo! The little dragon was proud to help. Gigan would do its best for Inigo's friends too. The green dragon chittered to itself encouragingly, picturing a happy reunion.

Inigo narrowed his eyes as Gigan returned. He nodded, satisfied with the information his construct had gathered.

“There’s sixteen of them still kicking around. Most near the center platform where they got some students tied up,” he said, speaking just loud enough for his companions to hear. “Three leaders and they look pretty tough. Reptile girl, Rocky, and Muscle man.”

Kaylee cracked her knuckles, the corded muscle of her arms bunching. 

“Good. I’ll take Rocky.” She met Inigo’s eyes, her own gleaming with competitive spirit. “First one to take down their leader wins?”

“You’re on.” Inigo grinned sharply.

Chihiro adjusted her grip on the sword in her hands. The underclassman’s expression was as placid as ever, but there was a quiet intensity to her comportment now. Focused, determined. “I will face the spearwoman.”

Christopher just nodded, arms folded over his chest. 

“Alright! I can thin the herd first, make an opening for us.” Inigo punched his fist into his palm, his construct Gigan shifting in anticipation beside him. At half-strength, it was conserving itself for the battles ahead. Still, that would be enough for now.

Inigo took a breath, blood thrumming as his dragon responded to the impending violence. Gigan would be sure not to hurt anyone too badly. 

"Let's go Team 1-D!" Inigo grinned. The enemy wouldn’t know what hit them. One more push and we get our license!

![So we go in there and we hold this pose until it stops being cool.](https://i.imgur.com/L3j6kNO.png)
>>battle song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5UC67Odw88
The passageway was narrow, lit only by flickering torches in rusted sconces. Christopher signaled his companions to stop as they approached the tunnel mouth. Peering out, he could see the broad circular chamber beyond, just as Gigan had reported. Groups of enemies milled about, weapons in hand.

Inigo nodded to Chris and sent a telepathic signal to Buru via Tsuga's quirk, this far out he could only send a single word - "Attack!”. Many chambers away, Buru led his band of students in a thundering charge towards the enemy's outside forces. Caught by surprise, the mob of foes scrabbled to meet this new threat barreling out of the darkened passage. Steel rang and bodies collided as the two sides crashed together.

Inigo and his friends sprinted forward into the main chamber. The enemy leaders awaited them. He thrust out a hand as he ran, emerald energy coalescing. "I choose you, Gigan! Clear the way!"

Gigan took on its large dragon form, emerald energy wreathing its surface as it built up power in front of the party.  Inigo poured his energy into the construct, and it swelled larger with every instant. Ten feet wide. Fifteen. Twenty. Accelerating, it barreled onward like the world's most destructive shopping cart.

As the enemy noticed them and charged, it crashed into the crowded chamber and bowled through the gathered foes in a single thunderous impact. Bodies tumbled through the air, accompanied by screams of shock and pain. Weapons clattered uselessly to the floor.

Gigan ricocheted off the far wall and made a second pass, scattering the foes who were still struggling to their feet after the first hit. Inigo guided the dragon back towards the tunnel, where it collapsed in on itself and reformed next to its master.

The three leaders stared in momentary shock at the swath of devastation the dragon construct had carved through their followers. The party didn’t give them a chance to react. With a roar Kaylee surged forward, the ki emanating from her cracking the stone floor. The rock-skinned leader had enough time to raise his arms before she smashed into him like a meteoric impact. The follow-through sent the brute rocketing across the chamber to crater the far wall.

She bared her teeth in a ferocious grin as she whirled to find her next foe. The hunt was on.

With a burst of speed the steel-bodied muscle man leaped and punched Kaylee, sending her flying to the ground. She slid across the cold stone floor, grunting in pain. He turned to the rock-skinned mutant and asked, "You alright?"

The rock-skinned brute dragged himself up from the rubble of a smashed pillar, shards of stone falling from his cracked body. He gave a slow nod.

The muscle man turned to face them. His eyes glinted from behind his steel facemask.

"Ah, Shiketsu's Class 1-D. We've been expecting you." His voice was smooth yet edged with contempt. "Since we know all about your quirks, allow me to introduce myself. I am Envigor, and I rule this exam with my partners, Rockhorn and Kamishiro."

The rock-skinned fighter and the reptile girl with a leather jacket stood besides him. Inigo watched them both, his eyes stopped at Envigor. Why did that name sound so familiar?

Envigor cracked his knuckles, the sound echoing through the vast chamber. 

"Unfortunately, you're not on the approved list of students I will allow to pass. But by all means, feel free to scamper about looking for another exit."

Christopher stepped forward, eyes narrowing. "That's not how these exams operate. All have an equal chance to succeed based on their merits."

Envigor scoffed. "Still clinging to childish ideals of fairness? Pathetic."

Inigo gave a whistle. "You seem like a pragmatic guy. Why go through so much trouble just to bar us? All we want to do is become heroes to help others."

Envigor chuckled, a deep rumbling sound. "I've been doing this for three years now. It's easy money, and my sponsor makes sure I face no consequences from the organizer." 

"We're gonna stop you," Inigo answered. "You can't just block people from passing."

Christopher rose up beside Inigo, leaning heavily on the wall. His expression twisted in disgust beneath his helmet. "You've made a mockery of this exam. How could you call yourself a hero?"

This elicited only mocking laughter from Envigor. "Hero? I've got no intention of being a squeaky-clean 'pro hero', nerd. I'm here to weed those who's unworthy." His lip curled in a sneer. "To put you in your place. "

Kaylee dragged herself to her feet, wiping blood from her mouth. She had taken harder hits in the dojo. This muscle-bound lout didn't intimidate her.

Rockhorn leaped and landed next to Kaylee. "Your fight's with me, weakling!" She blocked his stony fist and retaliated with her own strike.

"Pretty big talk from a lackey on someone's payroll," she spat. 

The metallic student bristled, flexing his massive arms. "Don't make me laugh. I don't need money. I do this for the satisfaction of crushing you." Rockhorn and Kaylee smashed into each other, debris flew from the right side of the chamber.

| *Inigo / Christopher* |

Christopher shot a blast of cannon balls from his draconic hand cannon at Envigor. The projectiles landed ineffectively and Envigor laughed. He thumped a fist against his steel bodysuit. "Before this exam began, I had specialists from the outside artificially boost my strength, durability, speed, willpower - everything! I am unstoppable!" His voice rose to a thunderous bellow. 

"That's cheating!" Inigo glared.

"A real hero faces worse odds daily! If you can't face me then you're truly not worthy!"

"We'll see about that!!"

With a roar, Inigo charged like a runaway engine in his heavy armor. His hammer slammed into Envigor, the shockwave shuddering the ground where the brute stood. Envigor roared in pain. He wheeled and swung a haymaker. Inigo took the hit head-on. Teeth bared, he exploded forward with his own devastating punch. But Envigor weathered it with a contemptuous chuckle before seizing him by the throat. 

"Pathetic. I expected more." 

Envigor hurled Inigo sideways where he smashed through a stone column in a cloud of debris. Inigo forced himself up with a cough, spitting rubble from his mouth.

|*Chihiro*|
***

Chihiro flickered into blurring motion, blade singing as she moved towards Envigor. Then - the reptile girl flashed in front of her, matching her speed.  "I'm your fight, girly." Chihiro nodded and slashed gracefully. Her scaly foe anticipate each attack, parrying gracefully with her gleaming spear.

They clashed in a hypnotic dance of death, Chihiro flowing between each strike like a leaf on the wind. But the reptile girl matched her step for step, her predatory eyes watching for any opening.

Chihiro broke away, circling warily as her opponent bared sharp fangs in a hiss. The spearwoman was formidable, her reflexes honed to a razor's edge. This battle could not be won through strength alone. Chihiro would need skill, cunning, and patience to prevail.

The spear stabbed out quick as a viper, but Chihiro slipped aside with uncanny grace, her sword leaving a red gash in retaliation.

Hissing, her foe attacked furiously, but Chihiro had already darted clear. They broke apart, panting. Chihiro watched calmly as her foe spat curses, tail lashing in pain and building rage. Soon that anger would make her sloppy and Life Taker would eat away at her strength. 

With an ear-splitting shriek, the girl attacked, lost to fury. Chihiro exhaled, poised for her moment.


***
| *Inigo / Christopher* |
***

While Kaylee and Chihiro clashed with their respective foes, Inigo and Christopher pressed their assault on Envigor. But the tall senior shrugged off their blows with contemptuous ease.

Inigo conjured up spears of emerald energy, hurling them in salvos. Envigor contemptuously backhanded them away. With startling speed, the hulking man seized Inigo from the air and slammed savagely against a stone column. Inigo's head cracked against unyielding rock and he slumped, dazed, as his body crumpled to the debris-strewn floor.

Crying out in anger, Christopher used his telekinesis to launch a volley of rocks, trying to pierce the man's boosted defenses. Envigor fell back only to feel eldricht chains wrapping around his body. He struggled as Christopher weaved his razor sharp construct tightly. Crescent spikes cutting into Envigor as multple layers formed. 

"Amusing."  With one punch, the hulking teen tore his free from the chains and countered with a second devastating straight punch, hurling Christopher to ground in a broken heap. 

Envigor seized Christopher's head in an iron grip. "Is that all you got?" Envigor laughed. He held Chris towards an glowing portal trap along the wall. "It's back to the start of the maze for you, Shiketsu brat. Your friends will be joining you soon."

Envigor's vice-like grip threatened to crush his skull as he struggled. Rage and helplessness warred within Christopher. 

He sobbed. He had wanted to walk the path of a hero, as his mother did... Failing here.. was like failing her. 

Through the pain. An image rose in his mind's eye unbidden - the ghost of a gentle smile, that day someone had praised his first scribbled drawing. He remembered pride and love in someone’s eyes as soft hands ruffled his hair.

*"Be strong, my little hero,"* a voice whispered. 

Power roared through Christopher's veins, fueled by desperation. Telekinetic force detonated outward, dashing Envigor away to crash heavily against a pillar. Christopher dropped to the floor.

Vision blurring, Inigo struggled to rise. Chris was down. He had to keep fighting.  Emerald wings erupted from his back once more as he took flight. With a desperate cry, he dove at Envigor, conjuring a giant lance.

“Up again, are we?” 

The hulking man watched his approach with an amused smirk before unleashing a blast of energy.

!!! Hero Name:「Envigor」
	Quirk:「Conduit」

	Type: Emitter / Transformation

	Description: Empowering effects from other quirks are lengthened and improved when used on him. He can fire off excess energy into a blast by shortening his enhancements' durations.

Inigo fought through the intensity of the blast. He weaved left and spun, slamming his lance into Envigor's chin. With a pained bellow, Envigor raised both arms slamming down hard. Inigo crossed his forearms and barriers sprung up. Bracing for impact as the crushing force drove him to one knee.

""I need to know! Why are you doing this?" Inigo yelled. Gigan spun into a mighty drill aimed towards Envigor's chest. Sparks flew as it ground against his stony skin. Inigo forced it forward, slowly gouging a furrow across Envigor's torso.

But it wasn't enough. With a disdainful swat, Envigor backhanded Inigo to the ground. 

"You wanna know why?! Because I hate this exam...and what it did to Rei!"

Inigo crawled to his feet, head spinning. Envigor wrapped both arms around Inigo, seeking to crush the life from him. Inigo flared his armor into spikes, digging into Envigor's embrace. They strained against each other, muscles quivering.

"Rei… Now I remember..." Inigo’s voice shook.  "Envigor. I know that hero name. There was a hero student with a license. The youngest ever to get one. She was killed by the Yakuza four years ago on her first mission. You don't do this for money. You do this for her!" He gasped out weakly.

Envigor paused, he let Inigo fall to the ground, his eyes bulged and then he laughed - loud and hollow - joyless and booming.

"You understand then. Why I can't you let you through." Envigor grabbed Inigo by the throat and held him up in the air. "It's all for my sister."

Inigo smiled weakly. "I knew you were a good guy... Your sister's death was wrong, but it's not a good reason for you to stand in the way of people's dreams... Everyone here is doing their best to become heroes. We all know the risk involved.. Just like your sister did. If she saw you now, she would be heartbroken of what you've become. She died saving others... She was a true hero. You using her name only stains her legacy. "

Brutalos roared to his feet. "SHUT THE HELL UP!" Envigor brought his crushing fists into Inigo's torso with piledriver force. Inigo soared backward, all air punched from his lungs. He crashed upside down into the unforgiving stone floor. Agony exploded through him as bones cracked on impact. He could not rise this time, the world swimming around him. Through fading eyes, he saw the cold grin of Envigor looming over him.

"You dare talk down to me." Envigor rumbled. Inigo saw Christopher crawling towards him.

"Try again next year.. I'll be waiting for you."

He raised a pillar of stone ripped from the floor, poising to smash Inigo's battered body beneath it. This was the end. Inigo closed his eyes, awaiting the inevitable. 

*My best wasn’t enough… I wanted to spend the internship with everyone… I’m sorry..*


Worse than the pain and failure, he'd have to explain to Hoge why he couldn't pass.

*"Baka. Get up, Ini."*

***
| *Kaylee* |
***
Kaylee's fist crunched into Rockhorn's face, pulverizing the stone beneath the skin. He hurtled backward, crashing through a pillar to land in a heap. Kaylee shook out her hand, exhilarated. This foe was tough, but she was tougher.

Rockhorn rose, dark blood trickling from his maw. Eyes flashing, he gestured and spoke a word. Kaylee felt herself lifted and flung back as if struck by a speeding truck. She tumbled across the floor, rolling to her feet with a wince. What the hell?

!!! Hero Name:「Rockhorn」
	Quirk:「Counter Harm」

	Type: Emitter

	Description: His stony mutant exterior reflects any damage dealt to him, matching its strength and intensity exactly. The harder an enemy hits, the harder he hits back!

Understanding dawned as Kaylee gritted her teeth. A reflector, redirecting any harm done to him. She clenched her fists, ki flames kindling around them. Fine. She'd just have to hit harder.

Kaylee flew forward, unleashing a barrage of shattering blows. Rockhorn raised his arms, each impact shuddering through his frame. His eyes flashed again. This time Kaylee managed to keep her feet, skidding back under the redirected force. Son of a bitch packed a wallop.

She circled warily as Rockhorn laughed. "You're a spirited one! But no matter how hard you hit me, I'll hit you back harder. There's no defeating my quirk!"

Kaylee's response was another blistering combo, fists striking like jackhammers. She felt her knuckles split, ignored the pain. Rockhorn fell back under the onslaught, struggling to shield vitals. Then the backlash slammed into Kaylee, hurling her into a pillar. She collapsed, fighting for breath.

"Had enough, brute?" Rockhorn taunted. "Just stay down."

Kaylee rose, limbs leaden and aching. Her head rang like a bell from the impact. She spat blood, eyeing Rockhorn with predatory focus. He wanted a demonstration? Fine. She'd show him her power.

The ki flames around her swelled, limning her muscular form. With a roar, she took to the air. Rockhorn's eyes widened as Kaylee raised her palm into the air and gathered energy into a rapidly enlarging spherical bomb of concentrated ki. She launched her blast at Rockhorn and ki exploded into him. He raised his arms, and grimaced in pain, falling back. He flared his quirk. The redirected force sent Kaylee spinning away, fresh agony flaring through her arms.

"HA! My quirk works for ranged attack too. Nice try!"

She caught herself in midair, cupping both hands before her. Raging verdant fire built between her palms, then discharged in a howling beam. Rockhorn crossed his arms, weathering the blast. His counterattack flung Kaylee to the floor once more, her own eldritch flames searing into her.

Rockhorn loomed over her, a sadistic grin splitting his face. "Even children learn at some point. How stubborn are you...?"

Kaylee forced herself upright, swaying, and bared bloody teeth in a defiant smile. "It's been awhile since I met a real challenge."

With a feral scream, she tore into Rockhorn, raining mighty blows relentlessly. His defenses crumbled.

"You're insane!" he yelled. "You'll destroy yourself too!"

Kaylee didn't care.  Lost to battle fury, she struck him without relent, heedless of the reflected damage.  Her world narrowed to the breaking of her enemy. Nothing else mattered. Bones cracked and vital fluids sprayed under her merciless assault. She battered his guard to flinders,. A final uppercut dashed his limp body to the floor in a broken heap.

Kaylee stood over him, chest heaving, knuckles stripped and limbs leaden. But she remained standing,victorious. A wild exhilaration flooded her, even as she fell to her knees. She had won. That was enough.

Back and forth they traded blows, almost too fast to see. Chihiro gave ground steadily, preserving her energy. Kamishiro grew frustrated, unable to land a solid hit against her opponent's flawless defense.

Sensing her advantage, Chihiro went on the offensive. Her sword wove past Kamishiro's guard, scoring shallow cuts along her arms and sides. None were lethal, but blood now marked the reptile's green scales. She was wounded, and Chihiro was untouched. Victory was close.

But Kamishiro had one last surprise. Spikes burst from her skin as Chihiro moved in for a finishing strike. She twisted away, but too slow - half the spikes pinned her sword arm, piercing flesh. Chihiro stumbled back with a gasp, blood running freely down her limp arm.

Kamishiro bared her fangs in a savage grin. "Not so swift now, are you little mouse? I’ve never met someone as fast as me before."

Ignoring the pain, Chihiro transferred her blade to her off hand. The scales were turned, but she could still fight. She charged forward in a blur.

Kamishiro whipped her spear around in a broad swipe. Chihiro turned into the blow, letting it sweep over her. She flung the blunt side of her blade up, catching the reptile girl in the chin and sending her flying up. Chihiro’s sword licked out from below like a white blur, carving along her foe's thigh as she fluttered away.

*"Waterfall Reversal,"* she intoned the technique’s name calmly.

Kamishiro screeched in pain and outrage. She charged again, drawing back her spear for a killing thrust, eyes alight with fury. Chihiro saw her opening. In a single fluid motion, she stepped past the spear's arc, guiding it wide. Her free hand grasped Kamishiro's outstretched wrist, holding it immobile. Off-balance, vulnerable. Chihiro reversed her sword for the finishing stroke.

But victory turned to shock as she found her legs frozen. She couldn’t move! She met Kamishiro's gaze - those slitted eyes now glowed with sickly light.

"I forgot to mention," Kamishiro hissed, "my quirk freezes you from the ground up. You're fast, but it won't work if you can't move your legs." Kamishiro released a series of stabs, each one landing on Chihiro's now immobile form. The young dojo master cried out in pain.

!!! Hero Name:「Kamishiro」
	Quirk:「Basilisk」

	Type: Mutant

	Description: She has the mutant form of a mythical Basilisk. Anything she gazes at is slowly incased in stone from the ground up. This petrification reverses after a short time.

Blood dripped down Chihiro's wounds. The grey creep was at her knees now, climbing higher. Soon it would consume her completely, leaving her a statue. As the cold embrace crept up her leg, Chihiro closed her eyes and stifled the pain. Her classmates had placed their trust in her that she would get her license today. She was going to let them down. 

Another spear thrust stung Chihiro. Blood blossomed. She fell. The reptile teen smacked Chihiro’s sword away, laughing. Drawing back her spear, savoring her helpless prey.

“So sad. So weak and now - disarmed. Tch tch…  I thought we’d have a better duel, Mitsurugi-chan. My sōjutsu is just too perfect. I even did my research when I saw you during the tournament. What a waste.” Kamishiro grinned and licked the tip of her spear. Multiple tongue-piercings shining as she savored the blood.

 “Your parents are dead, ya? At least they don’t have to hear about how you failed the exam. A silver lining to you killing them. I wish I could do that to my parents. It’s so badass. Any tips?”

Chihiro’s eyes snapped open. She summoned every last ounce of speed her quirk could grant. It wasn’t rage. She let her sorrow flow out. Her heart pounded like thunder. Muscles flooded with adrenaline. The world seemed to move in slow motion.

“What the hell!? Stay down or you’ll really get hurt, mouse!”

With blinding speed, Chihiro kicked off into a handstand, she launched herself and spun horizontally through the air, stone legs scything for Kamishiro's head. The spear shot up to block, but too slow - one foot shattered Kamishiro's jaw in a spray of blood and teeth.

Chihiro landed stiffly next to her sword, stone legs rooted to the floor, with a swipe she grabbed her sword. She was armed again and her enemy was reeling. She could win. Seizing the chance, Chihiro sprung into another handstand and lunged forward, putting her remaining strength behind the blade.

"FINE! I'LL END YOU FAST!"

Swearing, Kamishiro brought her spear into a finishing blow. Chihiro did not try to block, instead she swung with both hands.

The two of them met each other's charge.

They froze there together.

Seconds passed. 

Neither moved.

Then - Kamishiro gasped. The light faded from slitted eyes. 

As her foe fell back and collapsed, the grayness slowly receded from Chihiro's legs. She sank to the ground, fresh blood seeping from wounds. Chihiro closed her eyes, clutching her sword close.

| *Inigo / Christopher* |

"Hoge, is that you?"

Inigo opened his eyes and stood up weakly. Behind him, Christopher clung to a broken slab, barely holding himself upright. 

<Huh? No, it's Tsuga! Buru can't get through! I can hear what's happening over there!> The ninja girl's telepathic link spoke into Inigo's mind.

<Listen. You have to make a run for another exit. I don't think. We can get through this one....I'm sorry. We'll buy you time.">

<No! But we can't!>

<Just go! Please.>

Envigor loomed over Inigo and Christopher, muscles bulging, skin glowing with fiery light. The quirk boosts coursing through him had reached insane new heights. Energy seemed to warp and crackle around his massive frame. He threw back his head and laughed, the sound booming and distorted as he held a stone pillar above Inigo.

Envigor descended toward them like some unstoppable god of war. "What happened to all that talk earlier?!" 

Envigor slammed the pillar down on the blonde boy. Shattering and breaking what remained of Inigo’s armor. Teeth bared, he forced out his words. "I'm not done yet..."

Envigor scoffed and floated upwards. "Your courage is admirable, but useless. My quirk has ascended to heights beyond what students can reach! Allow me to demonstrate!" He raised a hand overhead. The very air warped and ignited, the air unraveling into blinding energy. An instant later it coalesced into a miniature star, casting searing light across the chamber.

"Try this!" Envigor hurled the incandescent mote. Inigo tried to stand, but Christopher shoved him aside, throwing up a black construct barrier in the same moment. The miniature sun detonated against it with the force of a bomb, driving Christopher to his knees, burns covering his face and neck as the shield cracked. He fell face first.

Envigor chortled. "Now do you see? You're lucky I'm not a villain. If this was a true fight you'd be dead! Go back to your schoo." He advanced toward them, each footfall shaking the chamber.

 Inigo dived to grab his friend. "Chris! C'mon buddy!" Inigo had to will himself to keep fighting through the pain, but another glance at that advancing juggernaut sapped his conviction. They were out of options here. Beaten.

Beside him, Christopher opened his eyes and spoke up, voice strained. "His body...it's not used to all those enhancements. He can't keep it up." Inigo looked at him quizzically. Christopher nodded towards their foe. "He hasn't taken a blow but... he's already panting."

Understanding lit Inigo's eyes. Envigor's breathing did seem labored, his movements slower despite the power rush. 

Inigo met Christopher's gaze. "Even knowing that... how do we win?"

Christopher gritted his teeth. "I don't know.. but if you have a plan. I'm with you."

"You run. I'll stay and slow him down."

"Idiot...We still have an after-party....to get to.....right?" Chris smirked weakly.

"Yeah, I almost forgot... Hey... I bet... Faith will wear something nice for ya."

"That'll be...something.." 

Both boys supported each other as they struggled to rise, their battered bodies barely responding.

 Envigor loomed overhead, muscle and sinew straining, energy coursing around him. "One last pathetic stand?" His voice boomed, filled with contempt.

A faint voice suddenly echoed in their minds. 

**<"Inigo! Christopher! It's Tsuga, can you hear me? I linked everyone together!">**

Dozens of voices flooded their thoughts at once.

Buruburu: **<Keep fighting, Shit-ketsu! We're with you!>**
Kinji: **<You made us a promise. We'll get through this together.>**
Bubblegum: **<You fought for us, so we're fighting for you!>**

Inigo and Christopher slowly struggled to their feet. Their friends were with them, even from afar, they were still fighting.

Raijin: **<We all believe in you. Don't give up!>**
Kaylee: **<I won my fight, so you better win yours!>**

They could hear cheers from Tsuga's quirk. Dozens of voices ringing out at once.

Chihiro: **<Have courage.>**
Random Student 5: **<You can do it!>**
Fight Man: **<GANBATTE!!!!>**

They exchanged a determined look. Inigo and Christopher shrugged.

"Looks like we have an audience, bro."

"I'm tired.. Can't they just let us lose?"

"I know, right?" Inigo grinned. "Guess we have no choice."

**<Everyone->**
**"WE WON'T GIVE UP!"**
**"WE'LL GO DOWN FIGHTING!"**

 Inigo and Christopher charged forward, emerald and ebony wings bursting from their backs.

Power gathered around Envigor as he aimed the massive energy blast. **"FOOLS!"** 

He hurled the deadly mote at the wounded duo.

Before impact, they combined their quirk into a glowing spectral barrier. The shield strained and cracked, but held against the apocalyptic detonation.

Envigor bellowed in rage. Face purpled from exertion, he flew at them, fist drawn back for a thunderous punch.

Inigo's armor manifested around him once more. Steeling himself, he raised his shield and blocked the titanic blow, though the force of it drove him to his knees. Bones creaked under the impact.

Envigor loomed over him, eyes mad with power. **"YOU BLOCKED MY BLOW WITH YOUR SHATTERED ARM!"**

Blood trickled from Inigo's grin. **"Yeah...so I can do this!"**

His uninjured left hand snapped forward, palm outstretched. 

####"CRASH DRAGON CLAW!"

An enormous spectral talon materialized and seized the paralyzed Envigor in its viselike grip. He thrashed and strained against the ethereal bindings.

From above, Christopher yelled out. 

####"MIRROR DRAGON CLAW!" 

Twin draconic appendages now engulfed their foe, constricting tighter with each moment. Envigor's face purpled as his oxygen was cut off. 

"I can't.. breathe!"

Inigo and Christopher poured all their energy into one last attack. Side by side, quirks resonating in harmony. Their united voices echoed through the ancient chamber.

####"DRAGON EMPEROR CRUSH!"

####"SHATTERED REFLECTION!"

Both dragon claws exploded. A shower of brilliant prismatic lights covered the chamber. The walls and floor of the chamber shattered under the forces unleashed. Envigor spasmed once as the spectral claws imploded upon him...then collapsed. As he looked up at Christopher and Inigo. He remembered his late sister's laughter and her pledge to be a true hero. He closed his eyes and smiled.

Inigo and Christopher clung together, utterly spent but victorious. Their friends' voices cheered exultantly in their minds. They had endured every trial and reached the end with keys in hand. They had triumphed, together. 

"Bro.. you're a mess."
"Heh."

Inigo met Christopher's eyes, seeing his own weary joy reflected there. 

***
DING! 

Lights flash and a victory tune emits from the exit door. They had finished the exam. Inigo and Christopher supported each other as they stumbled into the dimly lit waiting area, exhausted and in pain. They had faced every obstacle imaginable, but through resilience and teamwork, they had prevailed.

As his eyes adjusted to the low light, Inigo scanned the chamber full of bruised and injured students. Towards the left-most wall stood the pro-hero Impakt, staring right at him. Did he figure out what Inigo did? He'll have to deal with that later.

Looking away, Inigo moved deeper into the crowd, continuing his search. His gaze landed on a small figure curled in the corner - Hoge. Even across the room, Inigo recognized her distinctive Maru helmet. His heart constricted with concern. He knew better than anyone how hard Hoge was on herself. She held herself to impossible standards, never satisfied with her own performance.

Moving slowly because of his injuries, Inigo started towards her, every fiber of his being focused on Hoge. He had to make sure she was okay. The tests were designed to push them to their limits - mentally and physically. Hoge tended to heap judgement upon herself. She would see every misstep as a personal failure.

Inigo crouched down and gently squeezed her shoulder. She stirred, eyes blinking open, and Inigo's breath caught. Even disheveled from the exam, she was beautiful. 

"Hoge," he murmured, grinning. "We made it."
