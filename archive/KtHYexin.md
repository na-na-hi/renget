#Tao (+175):
>Mortal Philosophy: None
(+175)
A complete lack of Tao. A detriment for many cultivators, lacking a Tao is the sign of a fickle and unmotivated cultivator. It is the mark of the unmotivated, the lazy, the fickle, and the death-fearing. It also means that Heart Devil's are almost a guarantee, without the protection of the Tao Heart.

"Cultivators are like the rocks, the hills, and trees. They stand firm and unbending, until one day something breaks them and they fall. I am like a river - I will flow and change, and I will last forever."

>Sanguine Devil Bloodline (Divine Talent Royal Bloodline) (-70)
The [Sanguine Devils](https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/016/029/073/large/banjiu-e-vik-fierra-the-vampire.jpg?1566612868) were Demonic Beasts that primarily lived in the Lost Territory. Skeletal, bat-like, and covered in large red pustules of blood, the Sanguine Devils were known for their ability to manipulate their own blood for use as weaponry. They feasted exclusively on the blood of their victims, with a particular penchant for the blood of young children and cultivators. Several Devil Sects have interbred with the creatures, resulting in this bloodline. 

The owner of this bloodline is able to completely control their own blood - from forming it to razor sharp crystals of clotted blood to prehensile fluid limbs, it is an incredible utility in nearly any situation. Blood cannot be controlled if it has been out of the body for longer than a minute, and the amount of blood that can be controlled at one time is dependent on training and Body Tempering Realm.

Yexin may use blood stored in her World Seed for this ability, but the limited amount of blood she can control at once does not really make this too useful.

Allows minor control of bones due to the bone marrows connection to blood, but at this grade, it is limited to non-combat applications (elongating or shortening bones to disguise one's height, repairing a broken bone outside of combat, etc.)

#Personal History

##Taoist Roots:
>Demonic Wilds:
Free Techniques: Body Cultivation, Ambush, Stealth
Sects as they exist in most of the world are not common in the Demonic Wilds. It is much more likely for cultivators in this region to be trained by individual teachers, either Demonic Beasts capable of speech, or Demon Kings that can take a human form. Yexin was raised by Lóngmáo Zhī Shēn, one of the most infamous demonic beasts present in the Southern Wilds. 

"Mother was the one who raised me. She taught me to pick the berries, to find prey, and to move amongst the branches. She could rend the flesh from a Razorback in seconds with her beautiful teeth! ...I miss her."

##Circumstances:
>Young Master
-10
The only student taught by Lóngmáo Zhī Shēn in over 500 years. Yexin has formed a close bond with the Demonic Beast, and despite her absence near the end of Yexin's stay in the Southern Wilds, a Mother is always watching her child. Those that have experienced Beast Waves would second guess killing Yexin, at least without good reason.

>Notorious
+10
The Carnivorous Assimilation Scriptures are a forbidden technique that horrifically warps the body of the user, and have become almost ubiquitous with defiling the bodies of the dead. Combined with the countless people that were killed by the Beast Waves and even the brutality of Lóngmáo Zhī Shēn herself, and those that learn of Yexin's origin will be quick to reject and avoid her.

##Fated Encounter:
>World Seed
[Xuehai: Abyss of Sanguine Tides and Ossein Peaks](https://i.ibb.co/KyGxst1/DALL-E-2023-10-22-21-38-40-Photo-of-a-vast-crimson-colored-sea-that-stretches-endlessly-to-the-horiz.png)
Within the inner sanctum of this realm lies a vast, boundless expanse of sanguine oceans, their crimson waves rolling eternally. Isles of flesh and archipelagos of intestines dot the horizon, and towering in the distance are colossal skeletal mountains, piercing the skies. Periodically, the heavens weep a rain of viscera, painting everything in a haunting shade of garnet.

Any flesh, bone, blood, or other bodily substance placed within this realm will replicate endlessly, fresh and bleeding as though it were just severed from the body. Producing enough meat to feed armies, silk for the finest of outfits, chitinous plates and demonic beast hides for armor, and all other manner of resources may be produced.

Can be used as a storage vessel of infinite size... provided one does not mind whatever they store getting covered in gore.
Like most World Seeds, Xuehai has no use in combat directly. However, through using the Carnivorous Assimilation Scriptures, Yixen is able to utilize Xuehai as a massive 'battery' of flesh and blood, which she can draw upon to fuel their techniques.

"Xuehai is life - the sea of blood and islands of bone, the entire world beating like a heart. It gives food, and warmth, and life. It is so much simpler than this place..."

#Martial Arts (-80)

##Fighting Style
>Fist (Free Attack and Endurance Technique)
The Rigid Justice style is a fist-based fighting style that is based around enduring an opponents attacks, and throwing out powerful and punishing counters. Its practitioners develop strong bodies to endure potent attacks from their enemies, and their attacks are usually powerful and wild - accuracy is less important when you can simply wait for the opponent to approach and make the first move.

Yexin utilizes more than simple punches in her style, expanding to cover kicks, bites, and even more esoteric attacks, like venom and sharpened bones and blood. These attacks are difficult to land on their own, and Yexin usually relies on the enemy approaching and throwing the first attack so that they may get countered by a punishing blow. Afterwards, she can heal using their World Seed, turning most combat encounters into a war of attrition.

Exceptionally powerful against opponents that rely on Barrage attacks or Ambush techniques, but fails against those that can incapacitate indirectly (via illusions or soul damage) or single powerful blows.

"Weapons are a weakness - without them you are defenseless. My weapon is my body. I will never be without it. I will never be defenseless. Understand?"

>[Grade 10 Body Tempering + Grade 10 Endurance] Carnivorous Assimilation Scriptures
-20
Hailing from the Demon Kings of the Southern Wilds, the Carnivorous Assimilation Scriptures are a taboo body refining method born out of the relentless strife within the Demonic Wilds. Its creation was meant to harness the perpetual cycle of combat and mortality as a wellspring of strength. Its lesser form, the Beast Mimicry Scripture, is one of the most prevalent Body Refining Techniques in the Southern Wilds.

This technique bestows its practitioner the unique ability to graft any external flesh or bodily constituents seamlessly, ensuring zero rejections. If the assimilated parts come from a being of a lesser cultivation level, they are not only accepted but also gradually enhanced to match the cultivator's prowess - though by the time one is an elder, the time this takes can easily be years or even decades.

Some applications include grafting wings from large avian creatures for efficient flight, implanting venom reservoirs and toxin-producing glands for lethal venoms, and even assimilating specialized structures, like sharks' ampullae of Lorenzini or the chromatophores found in octopi. However, it’s vital to note that while organs and bodily structures resulting from unique abilities can be assimilated, inherent bloodline talents or distinct physiques of other cultivators cannot be.

This technique passively cultivates the users body, with no expenditure of effort on the cultivators part. However, this growth is minimal and so gradual that practitioners cannot rely on it to attain immortality. While there are ways to expedite this rate of cultivation, like utilizing specific pills, delving deep into one's personal Tao, or maximizing the assimilation of foreign body parts, the most efficacious method remains the assimilation of parts from beings in realms surpassing the user's. By doing so, the practitioner can siphon energy from these parts, granting a significant cultivation boost at the cost of degrading the parts that are being siphoned from. Historically, this facet of the technique permitted cultivators to repurpose the remains of fallen sect elders, which led to societal disapproval of both the technique and its advocates.

While relatively slow for a cultivation technique, its the versatility and disturbing nature of this technique that makes it forbidden.

It is through the use of this technique that Yěxīn has become the monster she is now, incorporating the parts of many beasts from the Southern Wilds. While she can return to a human form by simply removing her body parts and replacing them with human limbs and skin, Yěxīn is not fond of doing so unless her master requests it or discretion is necessary. The process is very uncomfortable, and takes a dozen or so minutes of concentrated effort to change between forms. When the situation demands it Yexin will usually assume the form a woman, but she is willing to assume a male form if requested.

Thanks to Yěxīn's World Seed, she is capable of recovering from wounds incredibly quickly through using the Carnivorous Assimilation Scriptures, filling in injuries and replenishing blood using materials from the world seed. Even healing from a near-death state can be done in a matter of minutes, with lesser wounds healing in seconds - of course, this does little to protect against the initial damage, only aiding in recovery. 

"I do not need armor. I have shells, and hide, and spines. I do not need weapons. I have claws, and teeth, and venom. Relying on tools is a weak point, a vulnerability... I do not understand why you cultivators are so quick to do so."

>[Grade 4 Stealth] Slicing off the Lizard's Tail
Deep within the caves of the Southern Wilds dwells the ouroboros newt, a diminutive demonic beast. It finds itself perpetually hunted by the Spirit Bat, a creature relying heavily on heightened spiritual senses for predation. To counteract this, the newt has evolved a curious survival mechanism—shedding its limbs and tail which then convulse and writhe. To the Spirit Bat's spiritual senses, these severed parts mimic a wounded newt's death throes, leading it astray. Fascinated by this evolutionary ruse, Lóngmáo Zhī Shēn devised this technique, as much for personal amusement as for its latent potential.

Rather than eliminating one's presence, Slicing off the Lizard's Tail is a stealth technique that actually does the opposite - it spreads out and expands the user's presence, making them easier to detect using spiritual means. When part of the user is removed, such as losing blood or having a limb chopped off, that severed body part will look identical to the user when observed using spiritual senses. This means that if an area is covered in the user's blood, it would be impossible to detect where they are in that field using spiritual senses - it would look like they are in every spot at the same time.

This enables the user to escape after being heavily wounded, being able to use blood or limbs as a distraction while they make distance using other movement techniques. But for a user with potent regeneration techniques (or Yexin with her World Seed), vast parts of the battlefield may be covered in the user's own viscera, completely masking them to spiritual senses.

This technique only defends against spiritual perception - other methods of detecting an enemy will work perfectly well despite this technique (though tracking through scent might be difficult with all the gore in the area). 

"You shouldn't attack a target without direct line of sight. It is easy for you and your allies to get covered in my blood."

>[Grade 4 Ambush] River of Tears (Blood and Poison)
A technique originally developed by a Water Tao cultivator, the River of Tears was created as a means of peacefully incapacitating her daughter, who sought to run from home and elope with a disciple of a Martial Empire. The technique caused the mother's tears to flow endlessly around her, forcing her daughter to trudge through the water and mud, slowing her escape. It was later adapted and widespread as a technique for denying movement in a small area around the user, but mostly only usable by those with the ability to manipulate water.

Lacking the skill to cast a spell to produce enough water for this technique, Yexin repurposed it to use his own blood and toxins rather than multiplying their tears. Rather than creating a harmless barrier that impedes those that enter it, this technique now fills the field with toxins to poison the opponent, and thick semi-coagulated blood to slow and trip them up. Very costly to use in wide areas, with anything larger than a dozen or two meters requiring Yexin to tap into his World Seed to avoid bleeding out immediately after the attack. It is best used in enclosed spaces and right before an engagement, to cover the field and allow Yexin to get the drop on an opponent.

Best used to prevent escape of an enemy and slowly damage cultivators to weak to ignore poisons. This has little to no effect on an enemy that spends most of their time in the air, and powerful AoE techniques can remove the contaminants on the field.

"The blood clots around you as you move, trapping you the more you fight against it. Don't fight - flow with it, and you might last longer- HEY! Flying on your sword isn't fair!"

>[Grade 10 Attack] Blood Spire
-10
Originally developed by a Martial Empire that needed a simple technique with high power and usability for its low level troops. The original technique, blood spike, was exceptionally potent, able to launch small spikes of crystalized blood up to 50 meters away while still punching through plate armor. The upgraded melee variant, Blood Spire, was designed as an experiment to see how adding far more blood at a far closer range worked out.

A simple technique for one with such a high grade. It involves the user cutting their hand or wrist - as the blood seeps out of the wound, it will collect around their forearms and elbow. As the user bleeds more and more, the protrusions on the elbow grow longer and more pronounced. When the user throws their next punch, like a pile driver, the blood will spear forwards in crystal spikes before exploding out the sides, eviscerating whatever the user is trying to attack. Damage scales directly with how injured the user is, with an attack from the brink of death being able to easily kill an opponent that is a cultivation realm higher than the user. 

Actually managing to land the hit without any footwork techniques is another thing altogether, and the more blood that is allowed to collect, the less accurate the attack becomes. Though if you jut want to punch a hole through a palace or fuck a formation up like you wouldn't believe, this technique will serve you well. Unlike most of other techniques, the blood from Yexin's World Seed seems to be unusable for the Blood Spire technique, for reasons unknown to them. It is still useful for recovering after the attack, at least.

Can be used as a close range projectile by punching the air, though damage tapers off after a few dozen meters.

"I do not understand cultivators constant lust for power... Though I must admit, turning someone into a red mist with a single punch is very satisfying."

>[Grade 10 Profession: Cooking] Divine Steel Chef
-20
Ancient recipes lost to the modern day, remembered primarily due to Lóngmáo Zhī Shēn's fondness for Dire Bear Dumplings. Originally developed by the legendary Szechuan Sage, the Divine Steel Chef technique relies on the user extracting the essence out of their ingredients directly, and combing them on a sublime level far more intimate than any mortal method of cooking.

It doesn't matter the style or the dish, a Divine Steel Chef is capable of using their ability to draw out essence and Qi from their ingredients to form a truly outstanding meal, every time. These meals can have a wide variety of effects - from Obsidian Flamehorse stew to warm one's belly and grant protection against the cold, to Divine Chicken Noodle Soup that is almost like a panacea against disease. A Divine Steel Chef can accomplish seemingly anything with the right ingredients.

Unfortunately, the recipes Yexin knows are woefully limited, mostly because Lóngmáo Zhī Shēn had only met the Szechuan Sage once in her youth. Yexin would need to experiment and try out new recipes and ingredients to discover how their Qi mixes and interacts, or study under legendary Immortal Chefs to try and uncover missing recipes - both of which sound like far too much work when she can already make killer Ember Oxen Ribs.

More so than many other methods, the Divine Steel Chef method of cooking is extremely reliant on the ingredients used in one's cooking. If using average ingredients, this technique will 'only' produce a masterful dish, comparable to a once-in-a-generation mortal or a below average immortal chef. If given the freshest and most sublime ingredients, a Divine Steel Chef can craft meals of unparalleled taste and quality, while still being perfectly nutritious and giving great benefits to one's cultivation.

It is said that a Sovereign once tasted the Szechuan Sage's food and granted him techniques and wealth unheard of in the modern day - though this is most likely a fairy tail concocted by Immortal Chefs that were jealous of alchemists.

*puts on 'kiss the chef' apron* "Let me cook."

#Skills and Wealth

##Advantages (-10):
>Undying Tenacity
-10
Yexin spent most of their life surviving in the Southern Wilds, relying on the teachings of Lóngmáo Zhī Shēn and their own ingenuity to survive. Even when impaled by demonic beast horns or falling from great heights, Yexin simply dusted themselves off and went about their day. No matter what injuries she may suffer, her combat power cannot drop more than 1 Grade so long as she remains conscious.

"AHHHHHH MY ARM!!! OH GOD IT HURTS!!! HEL- Hahahaha, sorry Master, the look on your face is priceless! Give me a second, I'll fix myself shortly."

##Treasures (-15):
>Forbidden Elixirs x1
-15
Can boost all cultivation realms by 1 temporarily, at the cost of severely harming the user when the effect wears off. Comes with a bottle of 3 pills, can be replenished in between adventures.

"I'm quite a big fan of these elixirs you cultivators make. They do not have such concoctions in the Wilds - take one pill and you feel like a Dire Bear! It is worth the 'crash' afterwards."
"Hypocrite? What does this word mean?"

#Backstory:
Yexin was born to a Devil Sect on the border of the Lost Territory and the Southern wilds. She was raised amongst some of the most evil that the cultivation world had to offer, those that sacrificed innocents for power and burned thousands of corpses to form a single pill. This sect sought destruction and power, to take hold of as many of the dwindling resources in this world as they could before they slipped away. 

When the sect began to clear trees in the nearby southern wilds in order to expand that trouble arose. Days later, Yexin's parents awoke to find their child missing from their crib - taken in the middle of the night, despite the countless formations and defenses that surrounded the sect.

From that point on, Yexin would be raised deep in the Demonic Wilds, most directly by the Demonic Beast [Lóngmáo Zhī Shēn](https://i.ibb.co/5Y8DLQk/DALL-E-2023-10-22-21-51-40-Photo-of-a-grandiose-monster-from-ancient-tales-set-against-a-twilight-fo.png), an ancient beast that had managed to survive since the last Sovereign. She had the head of a dragon and the body of a tiger, with iridescent scales and spines that radiated light. Her tail was a collection of snakes, and she seemed to move so silently that you would sooner hear your heartbeat than her approach. Yexin would refer to this massive monstrosity as 'Mother', and while her initial abduction was done out of malice and petty revenge, it quickly turned into a genuine bond.

Yexin was raised by Lóngmáo, who taught Yexin precious techniques from a forgotten time, and trained her to survive in the unforgiving wilds. They ate raw meat, partook of fermented berries, and huddled for warmth under massive tree roots on nights where the rain poured down. Lóngmáo's guidance allowed Yexin to survive, despite her pathetic human form.

Under Lóngmáo's care, Yexin grew strong. She took the claws of the Dire Bear, and could rend the bark from the trees. She took the hide of the Night Wolves and the shell of the Steel Beetles, until even falling trees and stones posed little more than an inconvenience. She took the tongues of the Vermillion Toad and added the fangs of the Howlers, threw in the acid of the Melting Jade Beetle, until a simple lick would dissolve flesh and scrape whatever remained from the bone. 

She were more like mother now. More perfect. Not like before.

It wasn't until she was 17 when Yexin saw a human again. A traveler from the Orthodox sects to the north, seeking to find herbs that he could sell. Of course, he only needed to give Yexin a single look before he ran for the hills, mistaking her for a demonic beast. Yenxi saw how the traveler ran - how he almost seemed to glide through the air and along trees, faster than many of the beasts despite being so much weaker. The man was special - he was using techniques that Yenxi would not be able to learn here, in this tiny portion of the forest.

It was around this time when Lóngmáo had begun to grow distant. As Yexin proved her ability to survive on her own, Lóngmáo would depart for longer and longer stretches of time, patrolling her territory and punishing those that entered it. Days would go by between meetings - then weeks, and soon even months.

Yexin left the Southern Wilds after a particularly long departure from Lóngmáo - Yexin would not even get the chance to say goodbye to the only creature she called family, but it was foolish to assume that was because Lóngmáo had died. Yexin traveled for a year under the guise of a human, before finally finding a new master to train under as a disciple. Yexin wished to attain the skill of the cultivators and the power of the demonic beasts - only when they have attained both, would she finally be complete. 

"That's the story. I hope it satisfied your curiosity, cultivator?"
"...Where did I find Xuehai? Uhh, uhm... I... I forgot? Yes, let's say I forgot."

#Personality:
Yexin is simple and direct, something that is quite rare amongst the world of cultivators. She does not have any lofty aspirations or seek understanding of the Tao. Rather, Yexin cultivates simply to avoid passing away from old age and to learn techniques that are convenient for her lifestyle. Upon reaching Grade 7, Yexin fully plans to abandon the wider world and return to the Southern Wilds, where she will search for her old master Lóngmáo Zhī Shēn. It wouldn't be surprising if Yexin attempts to fully become a Demonic Beast and abandon the trappings of cultivators when she reaches a certain grade.

Of course, with the slow rate of growth for Yexin's cultivation technique, that will take quite a long time to occur. 

On the surface, Yexin might come off as self-centered, even ruthless. She wouldn't hesitate to resort to deceit, theft, or violence if it meant advancing her cause. But beneath this exterior lies a deep-seated sense of honor rooted in the principles of Guanxi and Quid Pro Quo. Yexin believes in the sacredness of reciprocity. If someone extends a hand of help, be it a small gesture or a monumental favor, Yexin will go to great lengths to repay it. This could be in the form of a sumptuous feast for someone who offers shelter or an unwavering loyalty to someone who pulls them back from the brink of death. This mindset was born out of the actions of Yexin's old master, Lóngmáo Zhī Shēn - rather than killing Yexin as a baby, Lóngmáo took responsibility for her actions and raised Yexin in the wilderness.

It is because of this property that Yexin holds a great deal of loyalty to their former master Lóngmáo Zhī Shēn, as well as their current master, who saved them from near death. Yexin is extremely compliant as a Disciple, adhering to whatever their Master requests, even if it is demeaning or seemingly insane. The only exception are blatantly suicidal commands, and even those Yexin will at least attempt by relying on their inherent resilience. This blind loyalty can easily be used against Yexin thanks to their vulnerability to illusions.

Predicting Yexin's behavior is quite easy due to their simplicity, but their techniques and World Seed make countering their dogged stubbornness difficult. They are weakest against those that attack the soul or use indirect methods of combat, like illusions or mind control.

"My kind of woman? Someone like Mother - tall and powerful, with strong scales and razor sharp teeth. Having big venom sacks is a plus."
"My kind of man? Someone weak and defenseless, without hair to warm them or claws to mark their territory. The kind that you know would die the second you drop them in the woods."
