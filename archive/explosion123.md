ok so basically kpoppies who drag down other idols to praise their faves, engage in romantic shipping between two idols, force their own opinions on other people & refuse to be open minded, completely prioritize kpop over morals, sexualizing your faves and make disgusting comments on them in any way (this also includes having weird ass usernames & captions on edits like ok cool) & call others "sensitive" just because they think sexualizing *real people* who dont even know u is weird, forget that their faves are also human and have their own *personal lives*, actually sick in the head and delusional over them
thats not even all dude just dni if ur a toxic kpop stan what the hell :joy:
