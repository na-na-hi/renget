My family and I should have probably noticed something was up way earlier than any of us ever did. I actually beat someone up for suggesting that I might be growing boobs. For some reason I always figured if I willed it hard enough I'd Disney-magic myself out of girl puberty, too. Did some therapy against my will due to that whole being-a-minor thing, but nothing ever came of it because I just plain didn't want to talk about anything. I had video games to play, dammit, and this counseling was eating up valuable hours of my time. Of note, back then, I was such a weird kid that nobody really assigned very gendered roles to me growing up. Maybe I just didn't have a lot of opportunities to experience dysphoria the typical way.

I didn't actually think I could be trans until I was in my mid-twenties, since up until then I'd been fed a narrative about severe body dysphoria and an unquenchable thirst to transition Right! This! Instant! My friends would drag me off to bars and I couldn't get rid of the thirsty straight guys, but the defining instance that really hammered it home was when a guy I thought was my friend pretty much metaphorically blasted "In Your Eyes" at me via boombox in the middle of the night. He'd apparently built me up over the course of about six months into this ideal version of a woman I absolutely wasn't, by any stretch of the word. After hearing this horrifying trailer for My Life as His Supportive Wife and Biological Mother of His Children, complete with scenes of me waking up early to go on family exercise romps despite me having said multiple times that I never wanted kids, and despite me having asthma and all of the athletic prowess of a sandbag, I found I couldn't ignore the elephant in the room any longer.

Honestly, I don't want to have to go on T or do a full transition with a name change or any of that. Just surgery, really. For the most part I only get social dysphoria, but lately it's been getting crap-hard to deal with. Like to the point where I probably need anger management. Hell hath no fury like being ma'amed on a day that already sucks. I'm worried I might have to go the full monty despite personally liking my voice and a lot more of me than most trans guys have to deal with, and I don't think it's fair that I should end up driven to having to pay for hormones because I can't get past what other people assume of me. Cis people don't have to deal with that, and it isn't fair. If I could pass as male with just top surgery, I'd be happy, even if it meant looking like a twelve-year-old for thirty-some years and then transforming into an old man overnight once I hit a certain tipping point.

For a long time I thought all transmen and women had to realize that fact since childhood and I hadn't heard of a transman who weren't straight and for those reasons is why I had doubts for a long time.

I didn't grow up as a tomboy or anything and I was never really raised to associate toys with gender (I didn't realize that was a thing until I went to school). I played with anything from legos to barbies, was rarely put into dresses anyway, and didn't really give it a second thought. I still played with girls and boys pretty much rejected me.

I remember once imagining what I would be like as a boy once, drew picture and gave myself a name starting with the same letter as my actual name but never really gave it much thought about it afterwards. After finding out about what adult men had below the belt and discovering my own anatomy (being ignorant since I was still prepubescent) thinking it seemed like a smaller version and wondering if it would get bigger, less out of desire more out of curiosity.

By the time I hit puberty I was hit with a major wave of depression and I had no idea why. I was incredibly thin growing up which only added to my body discomfort. I wanted to fit in with the other girls, thinking that's what I was suppose to do. I felt like I should be wearing makeup and dressing in a more "grown-up" mainstream way. I was still wearing sport bras because I wasn't all too developed in the chest area and I never understood why young girls minded being flat-chested.

I remember liking the feeling of something between my legs, often resulting in me subconsciously doing it and remember being made fun of at summer camp for putting my hand there. Even though I was the same age as these girls at summer camp, they were already developing their sexuality a lot sooner than I was. I remember at that age I didn't really get things, I didn't even know where my v hole was because I never even cared to find out and I didn't even start my first puberty until the age of 14 because I was a late bloomer (I was pretty freaked out when it happened, remember calling my mom because I didn't know what was happening even though I had learned all about this previously).
Come highschool my body discomfort only grew as I gained weight. I was forever afraid of breast getting any bigger and the way my body felt was just wrong. But I could never tell why, I thought it was just because I needed to adjust, this was all happening so fast. My sexuality was also developing as I became less disgusted by the thought of sex but I was so sure of the fact I was straight and for whatever reason I was constantly telling myself that I am not attracted to women even though they appealed to me. I didn't like the idea of being a women attracted to women.

I discovered that trans people existed when I was 15 during a workshop where lgbt representatives came to talk about discrimination, one of them being a transman. I was just baffled by the fact that even though he was "born female" his face and built screamed man.

I would become more aware when i stumbled upon some transitioning videos first MTF but later FTM and typing in pretty ignorant things like "boy to girl" "girl to boy" and the whole thing fascinated me. I became more aware when I got a tumblr and start hearing about non-binary genders.
I remember I started playing male characters in video games and began writing more stories where the main character was male, I guess as a way to experiment though I was unaware of it at the time. For whatever reason I always preferred reading or watching something where the main character was male, felt it was more relatable. I remember looking at myself in the mirror whenever I wore this ugly green shirt and forever reason, it made me feel like I was some male knight and I fancied the idea. Even though in the future I would have to be on T for anyone to think of my face as masculine.
For the majority of middle and high school I wore t-shirts and jeans, sometimes tight but I couldn't ever bring myself to wear anything that showed off cleavage and made me feel super uncomfortable. I often imagine myself one day owning suits when I'm rich but it never seemed to feel right with the idea of being a woman in suit but rather with a masculine body in a suit. Before I understood the offense behind it, I remember seeing men in videos crossdressing for entertainment and had thoughts of me doing the same even though I would have to remind myself that it isn't crossdressing when you are dressing in something stereotyped for your own gender.

I remember coming across the existence of binders and becoming interested in what I would look like with a flat chest but it only made me feel guilty because I told myself I was not trans, I couldn't possibly be, why I did I want this? I settled with getting a sports bra for myself after finding out that the chest appears flatter in one (don't know why I never thought about it before).

Towards the end of highschool and after learning about nonbinary genders I decided to use the term agender to describe me but I told no one. I felt it was a way to make myself feel more comfortable because female just didn't seem to describe me. But as I thought about it more and more neutral pronouns never seemed to fit me and I began questioning the usage of masculine ones. I eventually accepted the fact that I was in fact bi/pan. Identifying as nonbinary allowed me to finally buy myself my own binder thinking I would try it on and probably put away in some drawer for months. But I was very wrong in that regard.

I remember the first time putting it on and nearly wanting to cry because I just felt so right, this was how my body was suppose to be. I immediately began searching on the internet more about this, eventually finding out that there were others in the same boat as me, who hadn't realized since they were young they were trans and that didn't make me any less valid. I struggled for a bit afterwards realizing what this meant for me but I know now that it's worth it to present this way and transition even if some struggles will come my way because hiding it away all those years didn't help.

(Copy-pasted from a previous thread)
My discovery of my sexual orientation and my gender identity have very similar beginnings. Both times, it was in the wee hours of morning. I'd been awake the entire night, idly link hopping and reading/watching things online. Both times I hopped onto relevant media (http://asexuality.org and ""ftm transgender"" on youtube), and while consuming I was struck with revelation.

That sounds familiar, I thought. That's exactly how I feel. I've done that. That's my ideal, too. And I spent the next few hours hunting down as much information as I could. I googled blogs, read FAQs, referenced guides, watched videos.

The only difference was that I was ecstatic to find out that I'm asexual. Realizing I was trans was more...ambiguous. Being asexual meant a lot about my life and history made sense, and it meant my life going onwards would be a lot easier, because I could avoid a lot of hassle and pain. But being trans meant more hassle and pain. It would mean huge changes, not only for me, but everyone who knows me. It meant transitioning, which I imagined would be a long and difficult and very expensive process. It meant becoming a part of an at-risk minority.

All I knew, back then, was that I really, desperately, wanted what the guys in the ftm transition videos had. I needed a male body. But there were so many obstacles and it would make my life so hard, and my experience was so different from the generic trans narrative I'd always heard. I ended up obsessing for a few months, researching all I could, asking questions, delving into deep introspection. I suffered in my schoolwork and interpersonal relationships because I was so consumed and feeling so much.
Eventually I got used to it. I accepted it. I started making strides, by getting a therapist through my university (who was amazing and helped me along so much), finding a local trans men's support group, finding out how to go about transitioning. My mother found out before I was ready to tell her, and it's caused strain, but we're working through it. My dysphoria is worse than what I used to experience, but I'm learning to deal with it.

And here I am. I'm graduating in a few days. I'm looking for a job, and I plan on moving in with my best friend in fall. I have a green light from my therapist to talk to an endo to get a prescription. My friends know, and are supportive. Now I mostly hang around trans spaces online because I've gotten to know the community and to offer help to anyone who wants it. (This turned out longer than I expected, but you did say you wanted stories.)
/end copy-paste

I did have hints in my past that I might be trans, and I've even had people ask me if I was trans or wanted to take hormones. I dismissed them, because I didn't think I could be trans when I didn't feel crippling dysphoria. Sure, I hated being seen as a girl most of the time, and I hated my voice and curviness, and I lived mens fashion and compared myself physically to other men, and felt inadequate because I couldn't match up, and I crossdressed every opportunity I had, and I dressed very masculine in everyday life, and I adored my short hair, and I always felt so good when I was cast in a guy role among my friends, but I didn't think I was trans. I knew for a while I wasn't really female, but I identified as genderqueer or agender for a while. Even though I do love androgyny and fucking with gender norms, I still felt uncomfortable with femaleness.

It really took the shock of emotions seeing what T can do and talking to trans people online that helped me understand.

I was a tomboy growing up. I was also an incredibly shy, sensitive child. I had anxiety so bad I'd vomit from thinking about interacting with other people. It became better as I got older and started to become more masculine.
I never thought my trans thoughts were abnormal. I assumed that tomboys were little girls who thought of themselves as boys and experience what I now realize is dysphoria. I remember once trying to change my name to something less feminine because it made me so uncomfortable. I didn't see anything weird about it. In my mind there were tomboys and trans women.
Eventually I learned that trans men existed as well thanks to Chaz Bono and after nearly two years of questioning my gender identity and second guessing myself, I realized I'm trans.
Then the internalized transphobia kicked in and I did everything in my power to deny that I'm trans. I hoped it was a delusion or a phase and I'd grow out of it. That didn't happen. Earlier on this year I finally allowed myself to admit that it wasn't a phase or a delusion. I really am trans.

i knew i was trans since childhood. I've always dressed in boys clothes, played with toy guns instead of barbies, never wanted to put a shirt on, confronted everyone who said i wasn't a boy ever since i could speak. When i met new kids i always presented myself as ""max"" and never said my birth name. I was sad whenever my mom would buy me something pink or traditionally for girls, dresses and skirts were my worst nightmare. When puberty hit, nothing really changed in my mind, but the body did. that's when reality hit me hard, i was different than the other guys and at that time i couldn't do a single thing about it. To cope with the changes i started to go on chat websites presenting as male. i flirted with some girls of my age and that's how i felt normal again. i was doing what the other boys did and no one could see i was different. At 18 years old i came out to my family and some close friends, i began therapy in November 2013, 4 months after coming out. I began hormone therapy on April 4th 2014. I'm currently in the process of changing my name, my request was sent to the government in July 2014 and i'm also working with a second therapist to get the approval to go on the waiting list for top surgery. My mother always gave me the freedom to be who i am, if you're looking for advices the best thing i can say to all of you who are questioning is ; don't be forced into a reality that isn't yours, don't be standardized by stereotypes forced upon you by society, you don't only have the freedom to be yourself but you also have all the time you need to get there. disclaimer i'm not a native english speaker so if there is anything that isn't written properly you can put it in your own words for the sake of what you're doing, thanks for helping the community!

It took me a long time to come to terms with being trans. Sure, I acted more masculine during my childhood, hated everything about going through puberty, etc, but it took me until I was 21 before everything came into focus. It was a time of a lot of self-growth and discovery for me, and I happened to stumble upon a webcomic called Khaos Komix, written by Tab Kimpton. Before reading, I didn't even know transmen existed! The parallels between Tom's story and my own were enough for me to start some serious exploration and I realized just how much of my self-loathing was the result of severe body dysphoria and denying who I really was.
I found a community on a few forums and was able to thrive and grow with people there. My social transition was slow but steady. I had a great supportive group of friends who immediately accepted me, despite my worries. My family is still an ongoing process, and I'm finally on my way to starting hormones!

I always thought, when I was little, something about being a female was off. It didn't bother me a whole lot but I had thoughts about being the opposite gender. I was a total tomboy when I was a kid. I never liked dresses, dolls, pink etc. yet I was okay with being a female. Okay is not the same as being fine. I didn't hate being a female, however I didn't like being a female. I fantasized about going back in time and stopping my biological sex from being a female. Knowing of course that I couldn't time travel I guess I was okay with being a female despite it not making my truly happy. Time caught up with me I entered adolescence. It was hell. I began to question my identity telling to myself over again "I should've been born male". I broke Down when my mother forced puberty education upon me. I dreaded puberty. At one point I said I would kill myself before I got "the cycle". Time passed. I didn't know this was called being transgender. All I knew is that I leaned towards masculine identity and that I suffered growing. I ignored these feelings for a long time. June 16, year classified: I get "the cycle". This is the final beating my biology gives me that smacks me to reality making my past experiences add up. I google my feelings. I'm a transgender ftm. Depression. Near death. Denial. Fear. Sadness. Anger. What will my friends and family think? Self acceptance. Coming out. My friends love me, and I love them. I now have a gender therapist. One day ill transition, but just not this instant. I now know who I truly am and my new purpose in life.

I knew something wasn't right when I was as young as four or five. I knew my body and mind weren't aligned. One of my earliest memories is asking my father over and over why I didn't have a penis. That's as close to coming out as a child as I've ever come I suppose. I have often wondered why I didn't push the issue when I was a kid and the conclusion I've come to is that any dysphoria I felt at that time was not significant enough to affect my life. Not until puberty anyways. By that point I simply tried to bury those feelings... and I guess in a way went into denial or a semi-denial. The worst years of my life were definitely middle and high school. My dysphoria manifested as depression, anxiety and jealousy. I was unfortunately very well "endowed" up top, so the only thing I could do to even remotely hide my chest was wear baggy sweatshirts and hoodies. For the most part I never bothered trying to fit in as a female. The one or two times I did it was an attempt to impress a guy and these charades didn't last long. It was during this time though that I found out that there were others like me. Trans men. I might have come out sooner if my parents hadn't been so judgmental. I recall watching a talk show featuring a trans guy. The guy seemed normal to me... I might have found it reassuring if my dad hadn't decided to throw in his transphobic and insulting opinion about the man... Throughout middle and high school, I had two best friends who I would try so hard to drop hints to. They never did catch on; and looking back on it now I probably wouldn't have either had we traded places. Things didn't immediately get better after high school. I went to college for one semester before dropping out and after that pretty much became a shut in for about four years. I would get jobs off and on (seasonal & temporary) but my depression made it difficult to do much of anything. I finally had my breakdown at 23. I had started looking at trans support sites (I had done this off and on throughout my teens when my dysphoria would get really bad). I realized what I was feeling was not going to go away, it wasn't a phase. I'd felt it my entire life. The first thing I did after pulling myself together was tell one of my closest friends at the time. She was apart of the lgbtq and I figured if anyone would accept me it would be her. The first time I came out was so difficult... but boy did it feel good. Her being so accepting probably helped. :) Things did start to get easier for me as I delved deeper into the trans community and came out to more of my friends. Some of my coming outs actually ended up being pretty silly or memorable. Two of my friends and my brother-in-law had thought I was a lesbian even though I never showed any interest in women. My aunt was the silliest though. I txted her that I had something important to tell her and asked if I could come over. When I got there, we sat down in the living room and after I took a moment to collect my thoughts I finally told her I was trans. She had this look of relief on her face after I told her which really surprised me. Apparently she thought I had come there to tell her I was pregnant! I guess it's not much of a stretch, my older sister had already had two kids by the time she was my age. I’m not going to go into too much detail regarding my parents... but I will say they didn't initially respond well. I guess my mother never even thought I was a lesbian which I found strange. I was always very masculine in regards to my clothes and even my behavior. Hell, when I was a kid, whenever I'd play pretend with my cousins (or by myself) I always took on the role of a male character (like the red power ranger). Anyways, this is how I came to realize and accept myself as a trans man. After I'd come out to everyone, I felt like I could finally move forward with my transition. I'm still working on medically transitioning, which kinda sucks, but I'm far happier than I ever was pretending to be a girl.

I am a recently outed FtM and pre-everything! I felt like I was a boy since I was little. I couldn't understand why my family treated me like a girl when I wasn't one. As kids often do I asked my mom about her breasts and she said she got them when she became a woman/mommy. However I found out from a neighbor about her dad's penis and became obsessed with it by the age of 4. I used to stick toilet paper rolls in my pants to create one and tried to stand to pee! I got it in my head that the penis was the same way as breast that I would grow one when I became a man. So I never argued with my parents about doing stuff because of that belief. Then I had a sex-ed class and found out you had to be born with a penis to be called a boy/man. Granted this was in a Catholic School system form K-12 grade which taught physical sex=gender so I don't believe that anymore but had it drilled into my head. I was devastated when I hit puberty and developed breasts of my own and started menstruating. I was hoping I would of been flat chested at least however women in my family are all big breasted! I was at a loss and thought I had to give up on it. I tried to ignore my desires to be a man but I couldn't stop fantasizing about it. I found out about SRS when I was 22 and wanted it badly. However I couldn't find any info on FtM other then boys who had a botched circumcision who were then given SRS to become girls when they were babies. I was depressed for a long time and even suicidal. I put all of it in the back of my head and just dreamed about it. I decided I would just be a transvestite/butch lesbian if I had a girlfriend because I couldn't come out. I was afraid of losing my family, didn't want to make it sound like I was ungrateful to them, and most importantly I was worried about how it would affect them. So for 4 years I repressed it until I tried to hang myself over other issues. I was dealing with my mother's brain cancer plus I lost a ex-lover to suicide. I was even more depressed then before. So I ended up going to a therapist and I told him I want SRS! However I decided it wasn't the right time with my mother's illness and things. Then 2 years ago my mom passed away and I was grieving over her. I tried to ignore the dreams and desires but recently I realized I couldn't. I ended up blurting out I want SRS to my sister while drunk having a discussion about my sexuality. Since that night I finally researched transgender and knew it was me.

I started to identify as genderqueer in college after a trans group visited out LGBT group. I'd never heard of genderqueer before then but it really resonated with how I felt. I remember feeling almost elated that I had words for what I felt and that other people understood. It was validating to hear other people affirming ideas and feelings I'd tried to ignore and minimize for many years. I live in a conservative area and there is a lot of pressure to conform, even among hetero and cis people. For my safety I femmed up my presentation when I moved home after graduation. I slowly went back into the closet. I have a lifetime of experience with suppressing emotion and memory. I "forgot" how important my gender identity was. I "forgot" how great it felt to dress and walk and talk like me. I put my energy into hobbies, work, relationships. A couple years later, I'd gotten seriously ill. My illness gave me a window into a side of life I had only been theoretically aware and triggered a lot of questioning. I had the transformative experience of slowly talking myself out of a deep, life-long religious faith. I began looking at the world differently-how precious life is, when you realize this 'ain't no dress rehearsal.' To cope with the vulnerability of being ill and to try to fit in as I re-entered the work force, I went into overdrive presenting femme. It became an obsession and it was exhausting. I could never get it right and I began to resent it. I started to feel like I was gearing up for a drag show when I was getting ready for work. I developed a shopping problem because I was trying to find the right accessories to be perfectly feminine. But that wasn't possible. Eventually I realized what I was doing. I decided to seize the moment and 'figure out' this gender thing once and for all. I was ready to stop hiding and start living. Having come out of the illness and realizing I needed to make a life for myself now and not waste any of this wonderful gift called life, I re-opened Pandora's box. It’s been several months since then. I have accepted I'm trans. I think of myself as a man now, and that's no longer upsetting. I have a long road a head of me, but I take heart in having this self knowledge.

When I was a kid, I met a trans girl my age, realized gender transition was possible, and grew to understand I was trans pretty rapidly (even though transition is different for trans men compared to for trans women).

Helped me understand a lot of things in my life up to that point and made me feel happier/like I didn't need to kill myself anymore.

As a kid, insisted on dressing the same as my dad (down to bath robes, even--I had a blue one just like his). Wouldn't wear a shirt outside because he didn't--which people kept telling me was wrong. Obsessed with telling people that boys pee standing up (inc. strangers). When I started puberty at 11, I started thinking about rubbing dicks with other men and topping men. Started a huge gay porn collection.

Stole my mom's credit card to get my first binder. Before that, I used tshirts that I'd cut up into a long bandage type deal and wrap my chest. Went by my last name (Jesse) or nickname (Sej) at school so I could lessen my social dysphoria. Used men's room, and played on the boys ice hockey team via loophole (since there was no girl team, I was allowed). Had to play girl team for field hockey in the summer but other (probably cis?) boys played, too (they had to wear the skirt uniform over their shorts just like me).

Reading Aiesu and The Testosterone Files and Becoming a Visible Man were big for me. Did presentations in high school about intersex conditions, endocrinology relating to homosexual attraction in males, and I proposed fMRI studies relating to sex and masturbation where the end goal would be attempting to understand how a female bodied person could experience the same sexual stimulation and orgasm a male bodied person could (among other things--these are just the only ones related to gender and sexuality).

Hid trans status from family. Moved out at 15. Was open with my lover and later with friends. Took care of my medical stuff once I was a legal adult at The Mazzoni Center. Their legal services team helped me with my name change.

I'm 25 and was born in 1989 if that matters. Never had questioning/wish I weren't trans/denial period. Did feel suicidal for a very long time but I attribute that to lack of T. It's gone now. Did pause transition to have a pregnancy because it was a cheap option for family building. Pregnancy was horrible and I wanted to kill myself, but I'm glad I was able to do it because my kid is awesome.

When I was young, I liked playing with toys made for boys and girls about equally. I played with trucks and with dolls. I played video games and was fine with dressing up. I watched shows about big, cool construction vehicles, but I also loved Mary Poppins. Even so, I had no odd feelings about this. I didn't really "get" genders at this point. I knew what they were, but I didn't really care or notice them.It wasn't until my pre-teens (about 11 to 13) that I developed strange feeling about my body, around the same time I started developing breasts and had to wear bras. These bumps on my chest made me feel very self-conscious for no apparent reason, where every other girl loved having them. I started to refuse to wear dresses and skirts, eventually getting rid of every last one.I also started exploring sexuality at this point, particularly relationships between other people, though I have never been in one, to this day. I wondered if I was really "straight", just a girl who likes boys, or something else. I kind of "knew" I wasn't straight, but I didn't know what I really was. After learning about how people could like people of different genders, I thought maybe I was bi. After thinking it through for a while, I decided this was not true, but it did turn my attention towards a possibility that I was gay. I described myself at the time as "a gay guy in a female body". I liked guys, but I felt like I liked them in a "different" way than women did.Eventually, I learned about trans people. In my mind, it sounded just like me, but I wasn't exactly sure whether I felt like I should be a man or not (I didn't consider being genderfluid or genderqueer at this point).A few years went by and, at age 16, I finally decided that I was comfortable with being trans. I saw myself as a transman, and I was proud to be one.
I came out to my closest friends in April, 2013 and to my doctor, who has been my pediatrician since I was born, April, 2014. I have yet to come out to my parents or other relatives, but hope to gather up the confidence to do so before the end of this year.

Read the book "Well of Loneliness"- it's a very long and sad story about a person who is quite literally alone in the world and isn't quite sure how or why, because there isn't a vernacular to express this loneliness.

“You're neither unnatural, nor abominable, nor mad; you're as much a part of what people call nature as anyone else; only you're unexplained as yet--you've not got your niche in creation. But some day that will come, and meanwhile don't shrink from yourself, but face yourself calmly and bravely. Have courage; do the best you can with your burden. But above all be honourable. Cling to your honour for the sake of those others who share the same burden. For their sakes show the world that people like you and they can be quite as selfless and fine as the rest of mankind. Let your life go to prove this--it would be a really great life-work, Stephen.” -Radclyffe Hall

I was 15. I didn't want to live as a girl anymore. I wanted her to die. So I killed that parasitic part of me that I had only let flourish to please other people.

It was actually on Reddit that I discovered I'm trans. Until Reddit, I had no idea that such a thing or type of person even existed. Such a medical process was never thought to be a possibility for me.
Then one day I decided to make a post in r/askwomen about a random thought that passed my mind. I just occasionally wished I could be a guy. Mostly it was the grass is greener mentality at first, just the perks and whatnot (peeing standing up, etc).

But the way I approached the subject was much different than the abundance of replies that came forth, and through those replies one woman pointed out that I may be transgender. I asked what that even was and was pointed to the various subreddits.

The rest is history.

Okay, well, not quite. After some research, I can't really explain fully what happened. It just 'clicked', and in my mind I instantly knew that "Wow! This is what I want!"I say want and mean it. It wasn't a discovery of something I've always been, but rather something I've always wanted. Still, it's strong enough that I don't classify it the same as, say, wanting a pony or a unicorn that farts rainbows. After countless hours of further research and youtube video investigation, my dysphoria kicked in and grew worse and worse by the hour. Then by the day. Then by the weeks.
I gave myself 6 months before allowing the thought to solidify into a reality, and thereafter, a need.
As soon as it became a NEED, my first priority was making sure that my relationship wouldn't end over it. I decided that I couldn't sacrifice it, no matter what. This was, of course, met with not a great outlook at first. It took months of lengthy communication, some desperation, and many shed tears before the dysphoria began to outweigh the cons and compromises necessary to begin transition, with regards to my relationship.
The compromise ended up being that while he, a straight male, will stay with me as a guy, in a relationship, he cannot be intimate. Meaning no sex, ever.
This was EXTREMELY hard for me to accept, and nothing short of devastating dysphoria could have convinced me to move forward.But I'm so happy that I did. I feel so much better now. Luckily for me, I had and still have wonderful insurance coverage. So it was a matter of heading to my local informed consent clinic and within a month of locating said clinic I was on T.
For reference, I'm 25 and the initial realization happened when I was 24. I do, however, remember instances during my childhood that MAY have foreshadowed the POSSIBILITY of this (I once tried peeing standing, was more attracted to boys' clothing, mostly hung out with guys as a teenager, hated wearing bras/skirts/dresses/makeup/etc, considered myself a tomboy, etc etc). But the cinch was discovering it's possible and my brain clicking 'on' about it.
The dysphoria was both physical and social, and even emotional as a matter of fact. It colored me, and still occasionally does, daily. Colored my perception of myself and the world and people around me.I cannot say how happy I am I moved forward. And I cannot recommend enough being true to yourself, no matter what adversities you face.

When I was four, there was a moment when I was alone in the bathroom, for what felt like the first time, and I looked in the mirror. As I looked, something felt off, wrong. I still think to this day the wrong feeling I got from my reflection was because I did not look like the little boy I thought I was. Around the time of puberty in 5th and 6th grade(around 11-13 years) I began to have dreams in where I would have a male genitals instead of female genitals. These dreams would wake me up cause me to look in the mirror and down my pants(in disappointment). Around this age, I also thought that doctors were wrong about me and that I would grow up to be a boy, not a girl. In 7th grade, I began to have sexual dreams of me having male genitals having sex with a girl. I then also realized how much I wanted to be a boy as I yearned to do many masculine activities. I usually ended up being the only 'girl' that played on boys' games in middle school sports. Upon seeing this, my mom would often ask me, "What are you doing? Do you want to be a boy or something?" As she repeatedly asked, I began to realize how much of my answer to her question was an adamant, mental "YES." I ended up attempting to ignore the fact I was an FAB and tried to validate my masculinity in an online game by asking, "Oh, what is it like to have boobs?" (I asked this to my online friends.) One girl replied and eventually we got onto the topic of FTM's and MTF's. She spoke to me of an FTM YouTube channel, and next thing I knew, I was hooked to watching all his videos. I was fascinated, happy, and scared. It made so much sense to me and I got to watch more and more YouTube channels. I was so surprised. I FELT LIKE THESE PEOPLE! So yeah, that's how I found out and took upon the label of FTM. It's funny, though, 'cause most of the time I've spent online I guise'd as male, even before I knew about trans people. Gender related things began to click into place in my life since my awakening. I'm so thankful for that internet friend who linked me the FTM video. So thankful c:

Hm, hm, hm.

I remember standing on top of a playground, watching the older boys do things I just wasn't big enough to do. Clearly, I was one of them. At least it was clear to me. But as I stood there, watching them, the strangest thing occurred to me.

When I grew up, I wouldn't be like them. Even though I wanted to be.

No, I would be like... My mom? Really? I'll have to wear a pants suit to work?! But that's so tacky! (As a child, I did not have much of a grasp on the meaning of the word tacky). But maybe... Maybe if I just... Maybe if I believed hard enough, I would grow up and be a man. Maybe if I ignored the problem it would resolve itself.

Ah, the problem solving skills of a 5 year old. Quite something to behold.

Then, when I was in 3rd grade, my boobs started growing in. I wasn't particularly overjoyed about the having boobs part of the deal, but the bras were cute, so who was I to complain? All I really cared about was that my brothers got to run around shirtless, and I had to wear my shirt at all times. What a load of horse shit. So, I got my mom to take me to the local barber and get my hair cut. I mean, I was already playing baseball! I might as well look like everybody else on the team! Then, the tween years struck.

All throughout my preteen life, I thought I wanted my boobs to grow bigger. But even when they did, I still felt awful about myself. I'm a girl, I thought to myself, of course I feel bad about myself. All girls do. All girls are deeply ashamed of their bodies, right? Age 11. Deeply ashamed.

When I was in first grade or so, an older girl told me on the bus that when girls reach a certain age they pee blood once a month, for the rest of their lives. Now, that is littered with misinformation, but /I/ didn't know that. Somehow, I found myself thinking that that would never happen to me. Ignore the problem. It will go away.

Age 12. Puberty strikes in the form of a red Niagara Falls flowing freely and unabashedly from between my pasty thighs. Oh, God, I thought. It's happened. I'm becoming a woman. I should be happy, right? But... Then... Why do I feel so ashamed?

I couldn't even tell my mom about my period until I'd had it three times already. And until that time, I used bunches of toilet paper to stop the bleeding. Anything to make it stop. Please.
Before I went to bed every night, I would pray to God that he would please, please bless me with ovarian cancer so that my uterus would be removed. Really? I thought afterwards. Ovarian cancer? That's a little extreme.

But as time went on, I began to feel more comfortable with my femininity. I took care of my hair. I played with make-up. I wore those dumb ass baby doll shirts that make your boobs look HUGE, (but unfortunately have the same affect on your stomach). And I was happy. Age 13. I was happy. But only on a surface level.

As is common with trans children who have feelings of dysphoria early in life, I suffered from depression. Was it diagnosed? No. It didn't have to be, because at the time I had no idea that my thoughts of suicide and increasing self-hated were out of the ordinary. And I was pretty good at hiding those feelings. So, you see, if someone, anyone, had noticed that I was a strange child it wouldn't have mattered. I didn't know I needed help, and so I would have lied to any doctor who tried to figure out why I was in their office. That was the type of child I was. Which is why it took me another year to figure out why I had felt this way all of my life.

Age 14. Eighth grade. My penchant for reading fan fiction was ever growing, but my love of researching all things I didn't understand had grown faster. One night, like many nights before that, I hopped on my Wii and clicked on the browser.

That's right, folks. I used the Wii browser. And I occasionally still do.

I slowly and painstakingly clicked out the phrase, "What does transgender mean". I clicked on a few websites. Most were aimed towards the women in our lovely trans family, but I got the gist. Some men were women and some women were men. Wow, I thought. That's amazing. I wish I knew what that felt like.

LET'S LET THAT SINK IN.

I wish. I knew. What it felt like. To be transgender. What?! I still didn't get the message?! Are you serious right now, younger me? Yes. Younger me was very serious.
I started to look at that signs. My hair was already cut short, and it had been for a long time. I only ever cosplayed as male characters. I refused to wear dresses. My period- Well, let's not talk about my period again.

That's ridiculous, I thought. Just because all of those things are true, doesn't mean I'm a boy. (Which is true). Just because I'm ashamed of my body in ways I don't really understand doesn't mean I'm a boy. (Also true). Just because when I was younger I wanted to be a boy so badly I was always boys in all the games I played with my friends doesn't mean- Wait, what? Just because when I wore my brothers' hand-me-downs I felt proud doesn't mean that... That I'm... Well, just because when people tell me I'm practically a boy, what with how I act and dress, and I feel... Right...

Oh no.

Oh no. No, no, NO, NO, NO.

NO. You do not get to be a boy, I told myself. That's ridiculous. Another memory hit me like a freight train.

Then another. Then another. It all added up. It all made sense. God damn it, I can't be this way?! This can't be me.

For about a month, those were the thoughts I was having. I can't be trans, I'm not a boy, etc. etc.. It was just a circle in my mind. Realizing more and more "evidence", pushing it down, denying myself. I self-harmed, although that was mostly an attempt to make me feel something. Anything. I felt so numb. But eventually I realized what I was doing was harmful, so I stopped. Mostly. Up until I was about 15, I still self-harmed when my dysphoria got really bad. But I'm done with that now.
And now we're here. Age 16. I've been binding for about a year, all my clothes are boy clothes, and I got my head shaved. My grand master plan is to be out to everyone by the end of this school year. Then Senior year is my year. My mom already knows, and some of my friends.

Age 16.

I'm happy.

I honestly have no idea how I came about it. It was sudden and the first thing I did was ask my Mum to book a Dr's appointment. Neither of us have very clear memories of what happen. Probably because it was so... Boring? It was just an "oh, okay" moment for everyone.
I can't even remember what prompted me to ask my Mum!

Always felt I was a boy growing up -- had male friends, was never into girly things. Puberty was painful, very depressing, hated my body and my boobs and how suddenly I could no longer play with the boys. Never felt comfortable with my body, gained weight to hide the curves, always wore boyish haircuts and clothes. Never told anybody how I felt -- it was too taboo. Came out as lesbian in 12th grade but knew it wasn't the whole story.

Learned about transgender and FTM when I went to college, realized it answered all my questions -- everything made sense. Except I was broke in college and it simply wasn't feasible at the time to do anything. Buried it for 10 years and enjoyed depression and loneliness for a while. I've always dressed in men's clothing and men's haircut and pretty much no feminine style; all my friends are male, I work in a male-dominated industry, and I'm "one of the guys" -- they treat me no differently. Still hate my body.

Recently re-awoken the trans thoughts because I'm finally in a place where I feel like I can do something -- job, girlfriend, location, friends -- everything is the best it ever was, so I can focus on myself and pursue transition. Came out to m'lady a few months ago and a few friends along the way. I'm starting T in a couple weeks and we'll see how good life can get!

I always felt different from other female bodied people but never understood why, then met another trans guy when I was 19 and it clicked, I was just like him. And the rest is history.

I first heard the term transgender when I was maybe 17. Around this time I was really struggling with my sexuality. I'd had girl crushes, but they were, y'know, girl crushes everyone had them. Plus the term, "I'd turn gay for them" really confused me and I thought this was just a normal part of life. Then one night during fresher's week, there was a girl sitting on my lap talking about how there was no lesbian's in our residential building, all whilst I was having an internal battle about how I would totally fuck her, but also shouting at myself because, no I'm straight and girl crushes only apply to celebrities (my brain would always conveniently forget about all the crushes on female teachers and friends I had).

It was during this time that I first heard about the term transgender. I was on tumblr when I seen an awareness post about trans people (remember this was roughly 3 years ago, back before the SJW threatened to kill people for making an honest mistake.) Now, when I seen this post, I was at the point when I could say I was pansexual, but only on a good day. That post explained so much and made so much sense, I was like 'holy fuck, that's me!' but, as usually I talked myself out of it. See, when I was younger, I was of the belief that you could only have so many standard deviations from the norm. In my mind I had reached my maximum capacity of deviations and there was no way in hell I could be trans, I was just identifying with it to be an extra special snowflake. Though, I honestly believe that if I'd managed to come to terms with my sexuality before then, it would've been easier for me to deal with this realization.

Fast forward three years, and for some reason I honestly can't tell you what triggered this, I'm back to exploring gender. It started with a 'okay probably gender fluid' but let's ignore that and just get a chest binder because I hate my boobs. I told my girlfriend this, and she asked 'okay, so you're trans?' I froze, but eventually I just went, 'yeah I am'. It was this saying it out loud that gave me the strength to go and research everything.

When I was younger, I always dressed in boy clothing [though my mother said that only started to really happen when I was 4/5.], my friends were almost always male, I played with male toys, and all round just acted very boyish. My family were very liberal when I was younger in allowing me to pick what I wanted, and always pinned it on me being a tom boy and eventually growing out of it. I never did, and right up until I started identifying as trans, they would still say I was a tom boy.
I was also a crazy imaginative kid who would write stories, all of which were centered around a male narrative, and all of which would look like me if I was male. I would always create little fantasy worlds in my head too, and in those, I was always male. It was the same when I was always playing pretend games with my friends, I was always male.

As I got older, I continued to create these stories in my head [and still do] and with these stories in my head, I'm the one that's playing the lead role, and the person in the lead role is always male. For awhile I forced myself to play out the lead role as female, but really the only difference was the name being used. It was also as I became older I realized that the way I imagined my voice was deeper than my actual voice.

Now for the dysphoric part.

I've always felt a disconnect between myself and my body; there would be nights I'd end up crying because I felt like I was living inside someone else's skin. This was not my body, and it had never belonged to me. It felt like I was wearing a body suit and during these times I always wanted to scratch it off even though I knew I couldn't.

Then there was the times when I would be lying on my stomach and end up stretching out. I'd always end up pelvic thrusting my mattress because there was something missing there and I felt like something should be rubbing against it. I can't really talk about boobs, I've always hated them, but growing up I thought it was because they were so big (I'm an F) and so I had to wear bras all the time to stop them from hurting.

I wouldn't classify what I experienced socially as dysphoria. It is slightly complicated to describe. I always felt like I belonged in with the boys, and so by that logic I could do anything boys could do and better. So I was always trying to outdo the guys, and prove I was one of them. I'd get so irrationally angry when someone would be sexist and say 'why don't you let your father carry that?' or 'that's for boys'. So angry. To the point where I felt compelled to prove them wrong.

I think, looking back at my childhood and growing up it really does make me wonder why it took me so long to work this one out. I literally created worlds where I could be male (I'm not just talking about fantasy ones, but real world ones too). But I guess I needed all that time to come to understand everything. Now that I have accepted my trans identity, I'm happier than I've ever been.

I knew because I became suicidally depressed after marrying a wonderful, wonderful man. Though i didn't act on anything, I became obsessed with ideas of ways to escape - affairs, leaving, drugs, etc. One day, I discovered trans movies/documentaries, and realized gender is a lot bigger than my conservative Christian upbringing let me know. I knew they were all delusional, but I did my research anyways...only to find that transgenderism/transsexualism are very, very real. And I realized that was it; that was why I only pretended to be boy characters as a child, that was why I only ever had male heroes, that was why i felt compelled to say things like "I could never be a mom, but I could see being a dad".

It's been a long couple of years since, but that wonderful man and I are still happily married - happier than ever. And I am starting T very soon now!

I had a feeling since before I can remember that something was off, but I didn't have the words to describe it, nor could I figure out the cause. When I was four, I was first able to put that feeling into words: a friend of mine and I were outside and I made a comment on how much I hate bees. She said that boys were more likely to be stung by bees than girls, and I said, "I'm glad I'm not a boy." As soon as I said that, I knew it was a lie and I thought to myself, "that's not true. I don't care how many bees I'm stung by, I just want to be a boy."

I didn't figure out that I was trans until a decade later. In 9th grade, some friends of mine were talking about a documentary they were watching in health class about four transgender college students. As they were taking about some of the trans guys I thought, 'transgender- maybe that's what I am.'
Thus started a few months of questioning my identity.

Lots of people say that encountering other trans people was a step forward for them in identifying as trans, but for me, it was kind of the opposite. I was very involved in the queer/trans community before, so I knew trans people, but never thought that we might have that in common. Throughout high school, my main friend with whom I talked about feminism, gender, sexuality, and such was another girl and we spent a lot of time complaining about all of the awful horrible shitty things that being a woman meant. 

When I went to college, I encountered for the first time in real life female friends for whom feminism meant loving being a woman, celebrating womanhood, etc. It was through conversations with these cis female friends that I discovered that not everyone hated having breasts, not everyone hated wearing make up and such. These conversations led to me finally realizing I had never wanted to be a girl, and was dreading being told I was a woman. I now identify as transmasculine and genderqueer. And that high school friend? Oh yeah they're trans too :)

I would not have realized if it were not for Reddit. I’m still not entirely sure Reddit hasn’t talked me into it!

I have always hated being female, but I did not think much of it because I thought everyone did. Does anyone ever feel good about being female? Of course not! It’s impossible to like. There is not one single female in all the history of mankind who has ever enjoyed one minute of being female. The only enjoyment females ever get in life are in those moments squeezed in when you do not feel female.

I spent a lot of time reading about what it meant to be female, trying to come to terms with it. Accepting being a 'normal girl' is a constant struggle; one in which I have never succeeded in 35 years. I still can’t think of my internal waterworks with any equanimity. Playing the chick role in dating and sex made me want to scrub off my skin with radioactive bleach, so I’ve quit all that – I’d rather die alone.

Of course, I had come across the idea of transgender people before, but only transwomen: ""ha-ha-ha, look at those freaks."" I had come across that dreadful book Brainsex – pure tosh, I thought, because surely no-one in real life feels female on the INSIDE! I did come across David Reimer – poor kid. Growing up as a 'normal girl' feels utterly shitty; I can’t imagine growing up with tits, and then finding out as an adult I didn’t NEED to have them, that I had my maleness snatched away.

The Internet was also a place I went to, to help come to terms with the doom of femaleness. Every now and again over the past decade, I would have a fit of hating being female to the point that I needed to find fellow sufferers. I would go online, and repetitively Google phrases like “I hate being female” “wish I wasn’t female” “don’t like being female” “hate my tits” “hate my period” “hate being a girl,” etc, just to find some fellow-feeling out there. It was Googletherapy.

Last year, a fit of Googletherapy led me into Reddit’s Asktransgender, and I felt I hit the motherlode.
Wow! So many other people who hate being female, in so many other ways similar to mine! I’ve never before come across people who sum up so exactly what it feels like to be female! Amazing! Wonderful! Glorious! People like me!

Oh, wait. They’re not females at all.

They’re TRANSMEN.

The realization was slow, but crept over me irresistably. Everything everyone said on Reddit was so right, and so true, and so honest, and spoke so closely to my spirit! It became scary how right and true all these comments were.

Scary, because it implied everything I’ve assumed about being female aren't in fact common to every female; that I’m an outlier. But if these comments are actually what being a trans-man feels like, then heck, I reckon I’m a trans-man. Or a demi-guy, maybe. Or a stealth-dude. Or an FTM.
The label FTM felt so much more fitting than the label 'woman,' that 'woman' sank faster than the Lusitania.

I wish, wish, wish all these ideas were possible for me. I wish I could do some of these things, just some, but I don’t know where to start. Everyone says, ‘get a therapist,’ but I don’t believe in therapy: you might as well say ‘get an astrologer.’
I wish I could, I wish I could, I wish I could, and every day that I find myself repetitively, obsessively reading the trans pages on Reddit makes me wish I could more. I tell myself I should stop visiting those sub-Reddits, that I’m ‘convincing’ myself closer and closer to some irretrievable precipice, but I can’t stop.

While I didn't truly realise it, I had an inkling at about 10 years old. I insisted on having my hair cut and occasionally expressed that I wanted to be a boy. Not very often, mind, and it wasn't particularly serious either. I think everyone just took it as me being a typical tomboy. I remember being happy about being referred to with male pronouns, being called ""young man"" and feeling irritated when my parents corrected people.

When I approached 11 - 12, I started developing my own characters in my mind. My 'alter ego' in these fantasies was male. This was also around the time I got bullied at school, partially for having short hair (I was constantly called a lesbian). At 12 years old, I realised what transgender was, and started thinking I may be one. This was the point I felt shittiest about being female. Also the time I started breast growth, which meant I had to wear shirts at home. Before that I'd always ran around half naked, only shorts on, so it seemed like a pain to me. I remember telling my mother that I felt ashamed of them but she corrected me, saying the term I should have used is 'embarrassed'.
Unfortunately, however, I didn't get much of a chance to explore these feelings. Further bullying meant I grew my hair out and eventually fell into a pretty deep depression. I repressed these feelings of wanting to be male, though I kept my characters for quite some time afterwards and often day dreamed about them in class. It helped me cope. I felt so disgusted with my body, hated looking at it, hated myself.

When I truly realised, I was 16. School was over, I was now in College (you start at 16 in the UK). That was when I started properly researching into what I could do to help me start my transition. What lead me to this this was how shitty my social anxiety had been getting. I hated being near anyone. Which sucked for me because I loved running outside. I felt pretty proud of the muscles I'd grown, that they were right on me and didn't want to stop just because of that. I considered my past feelings and wondered if I'd feel better if I started to transition.
I am feeling better. I'm in the early stages: wearing a binder, short masculine haircut, strictly male clothes; but it's helped tremendously. Sometimes I get moments of doubt but, thinking about how much happier I am now, leaves me certain that I am transgender. That my gender is male and that I'm a man.

I don't remember much of anything before 5th or 6th grade, but from what I've been told, I didn't have any strong masculine or feminine leanings as a child, just... equal in both? I grew up in a white, upper-middle class Christian family, so when I suffered from severe depression in middle and high school, it didn't make any sense to me. Looking back, I'm inclined to think that part of me knew something was up but didn't know how to express it.

After my freshman year in a small town high school I moved to the art school a few cities over, and in my sophomore year one of my friends mentioned something with a link that lead to a website called genderfork. (It looks a little different now than it did then, but it's the same website.) I read people's self descriptions all night long, I was completely drawn in and at some point I realized that it was because I was like these people. I'd never known the word for it, never known it was possible, but I had my first inkling of the truth then. I spent the rest of that year figuring gender out- sometimes feeling male, sometimes feeling female, and testing out things like binding and masculine clothing. At the end of that year I came out as trans male to my close friends, but nothing more. I knew my parents would never approve, and after coming to terms with my identity, there were quite a few nights where I was upset over the idea that they would stop loving me if they ever found out. This was also about the time I started experiencing severe dysphoria which manifested itself in very damaging ways, and which didn't go away for a while. I started binding as often as possible, but due to my schedule it meant 19 hour days in a binder, 5 or more days a week. My schedule has looked about the same since then, and I've done a lot of harm to my ribs and my lungs. It's certainly something that bothers me all the time, and had I known what problems it would have caused in the future, I'd've made an effort to bind less.

Junior year was pretty normal, I started going my the masculine shortening of my middle name, which seemed innocent enough. Came out more at school, but never really had the guts to correct people's pronouns or be very out. We had something of a GSA for a while, and I spent time in there, but it wasn't the place for me and when it disbanded, I wasn't too bothered. I started suffering from severe anxiety this year and had panic attacks all the time. My parents had me see a therapist, but it never went anywhere and I just stopped dealing with it.

Summer after that year, I settled on my new name (Wesley) and started asking people to call me that. It was much easier to be out at school my senior year, a lot of the teachers were very supportive and for a while things were good. I joined a local support group after school and really enjoyed myself there.

A little ways into March of that year, my mother forced it out of me. I admitted that I was trans, went by Wesley, the whole deal. She insisted that I would always be her daughter and when I said that no, I wasn't, she said I'd never be her son. A few weeks later we went on vacation and when my mom asked me to set up the hotel internet on her tablet, I saw she was looking at Exodus International (a ""pray the gay away"" type group) and a few other reparation therapy camps. (Fortunately, those camps are illegal in my state and Exodus International was soon shut down by its founders.) I was extremely depressed for a long time after this, and spent a short stay in the hospital when I was very suicidal. The intake therapist at the hospital suggested to my parents that they try harder to respect my identity. The week after I got out, I lived at various other people's homes. When I went back to my own home, nothing had changed and we continued to not discuss it. Due to that whole episode, I missed the time period for applying for scholarships and college, so I finished out my senior year and determined to work and go to the local community college.

Things never got better with my parents, my dad won't speak about it but my mother and I have had very many discussions where both of us walked away hurt. I've always felt very betrayed and rejected by them.

Now I've moved out and share a house with some strangers, but I'm out to them, to all my friends, to work, everywhere. My life is considerably better and even though my parents and I haven't and probably never will make up, it was totally worth it. There were a lot of people who stuck with me, teachers who were like second parents, and I've sought out other adults since then to act as parental figures when I need one.

It feels nice being on the other side of that whole mess. I'm glad I did it, simply because now it's no longer hanging over my head. And because I've become much braver for it. But it did suck for pretty much every day of that whole process. The good thing, though, is that it stops sucking. Not because I waited for things to get better, but because I forced myself out of bed every day and worked for it to be better. Worth it."

it all started when i was around 10 years old. i had just joined secondary school and i was in an "all girls" school (hah!) i was always very tomboyish growing up but had never considered being trans. i'd always thought how cool and better it would be to be a boy though. i came out when i was 11 to my few school friends as bisexual. over the next few years i switched from bisexual to lesbian and now i realize i am pansexual. it wasn't until 14 when i realized i was trans. i had cut my hair short a year before and felt so uncomfortable being called my feminine birthname all the time and being referred to as "she, lady, girl" all the time. it didn't feel right. i started asking my school friends to call me "aleksandr". it felt so right and i realized this is what it was all along. i finally told my parents when i was 15 and my mother still doesn't refer to me as aleks or he/him and it hurts but my dad calls me aleks and it makes me feel right i still am attending the all girls school but i only have four months left and once that is over i will attend college where i'll never have to be called my birthname again. c: glad i realized i was trans quite early on

I hope these little snippets of my life help you come to terms with yourself. A lot of you are probably looking for validation, looking for similarities between your stories and those of other guys. That's what I did a lot, wondering "am I /really/ trans" and stuff. So there's one similarity :)

Ever since I was a kid, I had the hunch that something was different about me. I remember I made this one doodle titled "diagram of a naked woman" (its contents were self-explanatory) and I made fun of the curvaceous female anatomy, unaware of my pubescent destiny.

I never said "I'm a boy" or tried to pee standing up, which is the main reason that I excluded being transgender as a possibility for me. I always saw myself as kind of genderless. Sure, my parents would want me to be a "good girl" and all that, but I just sort of agreed because I was obliged to be a girl and I didn't know there was anything else I could have been.

Ever since puberty, I had the hunch that something was strange about me. Even as I listened into the puberty education video for girls in health class, I didn't think puberty would apply to me. Yeah, sure, I was told I was going to be a "lady" someday and bleed out of my vagina and grow a nice pair and get fertile childbearing hips, but I didn't really believe that. I thought I was somehow exempt from the female puberty.

When I started menstruating, I had a constant, subtle, unnerving confusion. I got that "wait, what?" feeling as I finally realized my anatomy.

Whenever I bump my boobs I was all "oh right I completely forgot about that".
I always felt that my figure wasn't inherently mine, but I felt that since I couldn't really change it to what I envisioned, I'd have to make do with wearing my baggy clothes.

I didn't fully appreciate my previous co-ed friend group until it was taken from me in private school.
The truth of my difference hit hardest on our private school's first free dress day. I came in my camouflage pants, tennis shoes, and a hoodie, and I saw the girls staring at me in their skinny jeans, Uggs, and cute tops. It was then I realized I didn't belong, and I tried to fit in with makeup and straightened hair and cute boots and short shorts, but that ended up hurting more; I didn't feel myself when I did that. When I expressed myself for who I was, I was isolated, but when I faked myself, that disassociation was too much to bear.

In freshman year of high school, I went through a phase where I wanted to lose weight in order to achieve what I now realize was a more male-appearing figure.

Every guy I dated or danced with, I tried to out-man them. I insisted on driving, paying, leading the dance. After I went to prom with a guy, I knew I wasn't cut out for the dating scene; I liked girls better anyways. But even in the butch lesbian community, I felt like an outsider, even though I fit the definition to a T.

High school was also the time I started expressing androgynously. But when I put on my masculine clothes, I looked in the mirror and was disappointed because I didn't look like a guy, just a girl in guy's clothing. The first time I bound my chest down, I squeezed myself with an ace bandage until I was flat. I threw on a shirt, looked up in the mirror, and almost cried because I looked so complete, so me. My first thought was "oh, so that's what was wrong", and I spent the rest of the night euphoric, now that I looked like me. The part that topped it off was when I used makeup to contour and highlight my facial structure from soft curves to masculine angles. I still keep those selfies, and I feel so whole and happy when I can present as male, or even androgynously.

And now, fully post-pubescent, this body is here for good. Looking back, when I started dressing masculine, I felt so incredibly complete. That happiness when presenting as male made me realize that I wasn't happy being female before. That difference wasn't like going from a -5 to a +2, but more like a -2 to a +5. It was really subtle.

Someone asked how I would feel if I could never change my body, if it would stay female and boobs and pear-shaped like this for the rest of my life. The second she said that, my heart dropped into my stomach, the dread just overcame me. That also shows that I was unhappy thinking that I'd be a woman when I grew up, and how I expected to grow up to be a man.

And when I put on my masculine clothes, I expect to see someone male or androgynous in the mirror, but I'm taken by surprise every time I see my reflection--a girl in guy's clothes. It's like my figure ruins how I present myself. I'm always surprised and disappointed about how my boobs. It's not like they haven't been there for 10-15 years, but I'm still sort of surprised, and then I feel awkward, because I suddenly don't know any more how to use these or how to deal with them and they ruin the person in the mirror and then I'm pissed.

I was never constantly dysphoric because I spent high school in a skirt (mandatory). But when I dressed myself up, in my man clothes and androgynous style, every time I can't fit into the clothes I want to because of my sex-typical characteristics. I put on clothes and I expect to see a somewhat-good looking guy in the mirror, and then I see my tits and hips and I was like "oh that's right, I have those. wtf you ruin everything". it degrades the mirror.

DOUBTS:

I know this sounds very much like dysphoria, but I still have doubts. I was never an inherently macho person, never wished I had a penis, never had all-male friends, never stood up at three years old and said "I'm a boy", never had that DING DING DING moment when I learned about the term transgender, never felt like "a man trapped in a woman's body", never tried to pee standing up, never had that trans narrative. When I compare myself to the guys that have these experiences, I doubt myself for ever thinking that I might be trans. My feelings have always been fluctuating--sometimes I feel so uncomfortable in my body and I want to throw up when I think about it and I /know/ I'm transgender and I need to go on t, and then sometimes I feel relatively okay and I'll be so glad that I didn't transition and punch myself in the face for ever thinking that I'm trans.
This is what kept me in the dark about my gender identity for almost a decade. During the time that I was ignorant of trans issues, I got good at fooling myself and minimizing my dysphoria. Then, when I learned more about transness, I thought that my experiences didn’t count.

Additional notes: It never occured to me that I might be anything other than the label I was assigned. I was like "okay well I guess that means I gotta wear girl shit but I'll try to find the more masculine girls stuff"

I felt like a shell. I never felt like I was myself, never felt that I was living my true self. When I'm binding and presenting and contouring as male, I feel so myself. I feel so much more real.

around freshman year I wondered if I was a lesbian. I thought of myself as a girl with a girl and I didn't really feel that, just like when I imagined myself as a girl with a guy I just got that kind of "nah das not me". When I thought of myself as a guy with a guy/girl, that felt like me, that felt like that's what I should be.

It's taken me so long to figure this out because I've been using so much mental energy for years, struggling with a seemingly causeless depression, school, abusive friends, etc.
In the eighth grade play, I wanted to be the man villain and I got so disappointed when the acting director told me I "didn't seem like that".

When I was a freshman, in my acting class, we had monologues to give, and I wanted to be a male character.

I'm always "the guy" in my relationships. I've been told my personality is androgynous.

I was in college, intensely fascinated with an out ftm's story/progress through school.* I had always been very masculine, very butch, very "are you sure you're not a lesbian?". I had always been really interested in transition and gender-variant people's experiences, but never knew why.
It took someone (my then-boyfriend) saying specifically "I think you might be transgender; why don't you do some research" before I realized that I was interested because I was also trans.

I hated everything to do with being female since I was an infant. I always played with boys, had short hair and wore boys' clothes in school, but didn't think ""I am a boy"" because I was told I was a girl and had a girl's name, so I thought that must be the truth no matter how I felt inside.

Puberty was horrible. I ignored it until I couldn't any longer. I tried growing my hair for a couple of years when I left school, but it made me hate myself even more, so I cut it short again. Then I tried being a butch lesbian but the only part of that I liked was the masculinity.

I never realised changing sex was a real option until I was 23, when I found out about FTMs via Youtube. It was a huge moment of revelation. I watched as many videos as I could until I felt too jealous of them to continue, and referred myself for treatment.

I never felt social dysphoria, but I've always suffered dysphoria about my face, voice, chest, hips and fitness/muscles. Now I've been on T for almost a year and it's been the best decision of my life.
My identity is gender-neutral but my body is meant to be male.

I grew up before the internet. All I heard was one or two mean spirited jokes about "she males". The prevailing (incorrect) mindset was that trans women were effeminate gay men who got a "sex change" and then there were masculine women who dated each other because they were "too ugly to get a man".

In this pernicious environment, I did the best I could by ignoring gender and enjoying boyish and androgynous activities. I was angry I wasn't tall, I was jealous of boys (who were mean to me), I couldn't relate to girls (who were mean to me too), and the idea of female puberty, pregnancy, sexual intercourse,being a wife, etc made me angry. Surely that wouldn't ever happen to me!
When it did, I fell into a deep depression. The me that the world saw was not who I really was. I wanted to be a boy, but I assumed all other girls felt that way. I hated my tits, hips, ass, genitals, and the long hair my parents said I needed to keep because I'd look ugly with short hair. This reminded me of what I'd heard about lesbians. I didn't want to be an ugly woman, I wanted to be a handsome man, which seemed impossible at the time (late 1980s).

Things got more complicated when I started getting crushes on the few effeminate boys I'd see at camp or school, the ones who were taunted as sissy pretty boy "fags" who would get "butt fucked" by other boys. I fantasized about having a penis and getting to do that to them.
Long story short, I heard about gay men at the end of high school and knew that's what my brain thought I was. But after hearing the term "fag hag" disgusted me. I wasn't like those women; I was supposed to be a guy!

I first found out about trans men in the mid 1990s when the internet started being more prevalent. I felt first relief and then disappointment when I: a. Realized the limits of bottom surgery and b. Read that virtually all trans men were lesbians pre-transition and were only into women.

Within a year or so, after reading about gay trans man Lou Sullivan and discovering that this stereotype was untrue--there was plenty of gay and bi trans men, and there always were--the old gatekeeping system just required trans men to say they liked women only or else they wouldn't be permitted hormones or surgery. The system was starting to be more accepting.

As soon as I knew that it was possible for someone assigned female at birth to transition to gay malehood, I knew exactly who I was and who I had always been. I'm glad that young trans people these days, particularly the gay trans boys and lesbian trans girls, can access this information earlier and realize that gender identity and sexuality are different.

Basically, I went to a wedding. I hated being forced a dress and heels, not because I didn't like the clothing, but because it meant that I would constantly be told what a 'wonderful young woman' I was becoming. It made me want to claw my skin off every time I was referred to as 'she' or 'beautiful' because I associated the word so strongly with femininity. I dressed in 'boys' clothes because I wanted to fit in with my friends, who are still mainly guys. Guys made more sense to 12 year old me and still do.

Also, I pretended I had a dick when I wanked instead of a vagina. That was a big clue.

I vividly remember having an argument with my grandmother that I was male after learning the difference when I was about 4. I was very sensitive as a child so I tried to conform. It wasn't too difficult as it is much more socially acceptable to be a tomboy in the small rural town I'm from. During college I began regularly cross dressing and joining my male friends for beer and cigars. After graduating I moved to a large city and realized there was a word for what I was doing. At that time, I had been going by an assumed male name for about 3 years and started seeing a gender therapist.
