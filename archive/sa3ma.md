The delinquent's sister.

Harumi Suzuki felt the wind blowing against her, sitting unaccompanied at the Faraway park. She felt the cold whispers of the wind running against her, the rustling of the leaves in the distance, even the sun hitting her pale skin didn't feel as bad as she think. In a rare moment of peace, she felt she could leave her mind still, but...

"Hey, it's that creepy girl again."
"She's hogging the park's bench all for herself! Shouldn't someone go tell her off?"
"And risk looking into her face? They say her STARE alone can cripple someone!"
"Ohohohoho! Ohohohoho!"

The whispers.
The laughing.
They know I can hear them. Of course they do. So why?
Why do they have to ruin my day like this?
Why do they keep putting me down?
Why...

Why do they keep making me remember?
Haru lowered her head, she didn't want others to see the tears running down her face. She didn't want others to see her expression.
The laughing behind Haru kept growing vexingly louder, she felt as if she would collapse right then and there, the invisible grip of the world tightening around her neck and robbing her of her breath. Inside of her, she screamed. She felt herself slipping into a white, blank room as she lowered her hand to reach for the-

A loud thumping noise brought her back to reality.
The girls making fun of her turned their backs as well. They could still see the blades of grass being carried by the wind after the dirt below was struck by a baseball bat. The figure carrying it was a head taller than the rest of them, and the messy blue hair obscuring half of his face didn't hide his furious look.
The girls were quick to scatter when he lifted the bat off the ground and pointed it in their direction. After looking around for a moment to see everyone else leave, Sunny let out a sigh and went to sit next to his sister.
He collapsed on the bench next to Haru, still looking straight ahead into the forests deep within the park.

"...I'm sorry."
Hearing the voice of her brother, Haru finally brought her head back up.
"It's my fault for making you go out... I just couldn't bear seeing you rot away in our room like that."
Sunny finally turned to see his sister's face. He felt a sharp pain in his heart seeing her reddened eyes and drying tears. Haru saw Sunny reach into his pockets for something, a handkerchief, and didn't do anything as he carefully wiped the tears off her face.
She thought for a moment, the stark contrast of her tough-looking brother carrying around clean handkerchiefs made her smile.

"Haru...Your hands are still shaking."
She put her head down again, it was true. Her heart was still beating fast after having to endure all that. She felt her thoughts start racing remembering the experience, but was saved again by Sunny taking hold of her hand.
The delinquent-looking boy got up.

"Come on, let's go home already. I think you've had enough of the sun for a day."
It was hard to see through his face, but he was definitely smiling. Haru managed to hold back a sniffle as she got up and started clinging to her brother.
"...I could never have enough of you, Sunny."
She only whispered it, but she was sure he heard it.
