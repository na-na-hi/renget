The Hist's Experiment 


Part 1:

Farrow, on all his travels, had not yet been here. The smell of the swampy river ran through the city and met his nose with a certain intrigue, mixing with the exotic meats of the market. The city of Leyawiin was made up of storefronts and houses that had a distinct characteristic of Imperial charm that met the exotic flavors of the neighboring regions, stone, moss, and wood were their elements. It was bustling today. Merchants in hooded robes were pulling carts of wine barrels and cheese. Cat-tailed gem vendors set up booths in the town’s merchant district, not a care in the world about the day’s drizzle. The merchants and diverse cityfolk were already bartering.

Farrow was a well-known trader among the jewelers of the Imperial City. The young, rising star often traveled to other provinces for inspiration and to collect the raw materials of Tamriel. His secret was that he collected other things too. Exotic men among them. He was the son of a Breton father and Imperial mother, to a family involved in the shipping business of Cyrodiil. Now though, he didn’t feel so noble, the humidity clouding the streets of Leyawiin were already turning his long blonde hair wavy. He let out a sigh as it started raining, running under the alcove of an ivy-covered building. This was where he wanted to be for now.

A Khajiit woman gave him a sideways glance, before pulling out a flask of what he presumed to be Skooma. She took a drink.

“What business brings you to our market today, young one?” She asked in a raspy voice. 

Farrow was a bit shy about his age, despite his wealth. “I collect jewelry, madam. I heard about your gem market that happens this time of the year and needed to see for myself.”

She looked at him strangely. “That can’t be the only reason you are here, no?”

Farrow didn’t know how to respond. There was something about this Khajiit’s presence. “No…I suppose not.” 

She smiled with her green pupils. “We Khajiit study the arts of divination. I can see you are not here for just jewelry. Would you care for a reading, darling?”

Farrow was entranced, realizing he had been standing outside a starry fortune telling shop, he had even missed the slight scent of woody incense that was wafting around the air. Perhaps he could see what his future held. With a certain seduction, the fortune teller beckoned Farrow inside, but before he could step inside a scaled hand pulled him back. It was an Argonian man. 

“Sorry dear traveler. I hope you are not presuming to empty your wallet at Madam Yona’s? She charges quite a fee.” His words came out in a swampy, serpentine way, almost tickling Farrow’s face.”

Farrow was paralyzed. He looked the Argonian man up and down. The man’s green scales covered a lean, but somewhat muscled frame. His white linen shirt was drenched in what he presumed to be rain, and his red breeches were excessively baggy, almost like a circus performer’s. Glancing down further he saw the lizard was barefoot. Despite the eccentric dress, this man carried himself with an air of confidence, not unlike the merchants of the Imperial City.

“I’m sorry! I didn’t know…I am not from here.” Suddenly, he was at a loss for words. Still taking in the unique presence.

“So, what are you doing here in Leyawiin besides trying to get ripped-off? You aren’t chasing after the skooma-tails are you?” The Argonian laughed.

“Not in particular.” Farrow smiled.

 “Quite some weather too? I got caught in the downpour. Feels good on our scales though.” The Argonian didn’t have the same set of facial expressions an imperial would make, but his voice was quite expressive. “I overheard that you are a trader. I got to warn you, stranger, this market is full of bad characters, their gems are a dime a dozen, marked up to unholy prices. I really don’t like the way they do business.”

Farrow nodded. “I never would have known, I mean, I do this for a living and still manage to be fooled sometimes. Shame on me.” The trader reached out a hand. “A sincere thanks and to whom do I owe the pleasure?”

The Argonian man grinned with all his teeth and returned the handshake. Farrow had never seen such an expressive Argonian before. He found it produced a curious warmth in him. “My name is Julios. I own a curiosity shop near the guild district. Sometimes I come around here to warn newcomers before they find their wallets empty. The Khajiit here really hate me. Ahahahaha.” 

“A curiosity shop? Pray tell. What do you collect?” Every sense of Farrow was drinking in his new acquaintance’s presence. The half-imperial was slowly being led away from the Fortune teller’s towards a nearby tavern-front, a welcome arm guided Farrow to where they continued. 

“I collect treasure found in the Leyawiin swamp, and stuff I salvage from shipwrecks. Oh! My shop hosts a smoke lounge too.” The man stopped and looked at Farrow directly. “You seem a bit weary from your travels.”

Farrow sighed out. He had held in some of the stress from the market, and the journey had been taxing, though he did have a room at the nicest inn in the city.

“Come, traveler. Let me show you the hospitality of my kind. You are in need of a relaxing sofa and pipe.”

Farrow couldn’t say no to the glowing face, nor did he want to. In fact, he did his best to hide his eagerness, wondering whether or not he would be able to bed the curious Argonian later. 





Part 2:

The rain was letting down now, the cobblestone paths of leyawiin were littered with deep puddles. Farrow’s loafers were soaked as he saw that Julios’s feet were bare not out of poverty, but out of wisdom. Trekking through the muddy city was not what he had been expecting today, but being led by the confident Argonian made up for it. 

“Almost there! Just over here, kind traveler.” Julios guided them towards a dirt path that went behind the guild halls and into a grove of tall mossy oaks. In Between them was a 2 story building with wide shuttered windows and a tall black chimney. “There we go, dear guest, right up in there. But by the Hist, do please leave your muddy shoes at the entrance!” 

Farrow took off his shoes and peered inside. The interior was dim and covered in rugs, curtains, and piles upon piles of curiosities. Some of it was framed paintings, other was tribal totems and carvings, all of it gave the impression of being inside a living museum. If not for his weariness, he would have been inspecting every object, asking about the history of each. But, at the time, his object of interest was fetching a towel from the adjacent room. 

“To dry yourself off with— Come here!” He beckoned. “We’ll have plenty of time for you to ask me about my goods later.” Farrow entered the side lounge of the house, lamps hanging from the ceiling dimly lit a maroon curtained room. The place was littered with cushions and lounge chairs. On the wall were tapestries depicting Argonian tribal art.

“You don’t live here all by yourself do you?” The merchant asked.

“Well…not for very long at a time, curious traveler.” The Argonian was already filling a pipe with tobacco. Somewhere in time the man’s wet shirt had also come off.  “Not for very long.” He packed the pipe full enough that some of the herb was falling out. “Come. Sit by me, traveler. I want to share this with you.” 

Farrow smiled. He walked over and sat on the wide and low chair alongside him. He could feel a surprising warmth radiate from the Argonian. Julios put one arm around him and took a deep puff with his other. He set the pipe down on the nearby table. 

“You are so tense, traveler. It’s almost as if you have never been with my kind before.”

Farrow blushed. “Sorry, I don’t quite know what to say.”

Julios began to massage around Farrow’s tense shoulders. “You know, I don’t actually normally stop stranger’s from going into Madam Yona’s…”

Farrow chuckled. Finally easing his tension. “You couldn’t pass me up could you?”

“Not one as handsome as you, dear traveler.” The Argonian’s hands were exploring the half-Imperial’s thighs. His serpentine face was exploring the back of Farrow’s neck. Julios reached for his pipe again and offered it forth. “Go ahead and try. It will relax you even deeper.”

He breathed in, finally registering that the strange smell wasn’t tobacco. He coughed a little out before handing the pipe back to Julios. Both laughed as if they were adolescents again. 

“It’s good, right?” The Argonian laughed, his chest rumbling against Farrow. “Sorry. Perhaps that’s enough, we won’t set our lungs on fire this early in the evening. I hope you choose to stay in my company tonight.” Julios set the pipe aside before turning back to more pressing matters. 

“I can’t object to that.” Farrow responded.

The two drank each other’s presence before settling into a kiss. The lizard-like tongue gently explored Farrow’s own, meeting tongues, they exchanged a passion not common for strangers. They had moved into lounging on top of one another in the low chair. 

“I am glad I caught you today, stranger.” 

They were exploring each other with hands and tongue. “Please, call me Farrow, dear Argonian.” He felt the strong muscles of his scaled back where it met his tail. “Also, it is true that in all my travels, I’ve never kissed an Argonian.” 

Julios rumbled with laughter, pulling the shy Imperial man close to him. “I’m flattered, of course, that I am to share the secrets of my kind with you.” He held the sole of Farrow’s cold foot, leaning in with his warmest voice, knowing the effect it had on him, he whispered. “I am trained in the art of my homeland’s magic, dear Farrow. I can craft spells that give us the energy to go for days on end. I can make you more sensitive to my touch.” He trailed his hand over the Imperial’s clothed member. He gave it a firm press, causing Farrow to turn deep red and thrust forward. They reached in for another kiss. 

They spent half an hour kissing and touching, the humid afternoon set the perfect backdrop for their indoor explorations. Normally, Farrow would have insisted on fucking by this point, but to him the new sensations of scales against sweaty skin was ecstasy enough. Both had shed their clothes except for their silk undershorts, the common style of underwear for the era. Julios looked up from his snack. 

“I think we will have more fun after you rest. I know today’s travels have made you weary and don’t want to see you struggle to keep your eyes open while fucking you later.” Teased Julios. 

The Argonian led the half-Imperial upstairs to a spacious loft where among the boxes of treasure was a messy bed draped with layers of cotton sheets and blankets. Several pairs of the Argonians underwear and undershirts covered it as well. Farrow did not mind this at all, in fact he found it endearing. 

“Please, take a rest here, traveler. I am going to procure some materials for tonight’s ritual. I will be back shortly.” Julios patted Farrow’s head, then slinked downstairs. Farrow waited for him to leave before changing out of his own underwear into a pair of Julios’s. Then his weariness caught up to him and he fell asleep.





Part 3 

When he awoke the room was still and dark. It took Farrow a minute to realize where he was. An unnatural silence filled the space of the now unfamiliar attic. He called out for his friend, but the words died before they left his mouth. There was a presence here, but it wasn’t Julios. Then he heard whispering.

“We have chosen you.” The sound was coming from no other than Farrow’s own head. It was an alien presence and the way it spoke was as if it was older than words. “To be his lover.” Then a pause. The voice rang in Farrow’s head as forest sounds and creaking filled the room. He could smell something sweet like tree bark, but it filled him with dread…and arousal. Now there were multiple voices but a lot of them seemed to agree and say the same thing: “Join him, now.”

Farrow awoke to a set of familiar green Argonian eyes staring at him through the dark. The two pressed their lower halves together, anticipating how it would feel without any material between them. It made the half-Imperial even harder. 

Julios put his scaled hand on Farrow’s chest. “You heard them, just now?”

“Yes. What are they?” Farrow asked.

“The Hist, dear traveler. Our source of life. And from what I can tell…they seem to like you.” 

Julios smiled playfully and both felt at ease again. The Argonian looked down to see the Imperial’s shaft filling out the fabric of the Argonians' own underwear. They were a green pair with floral designs on them, curiously enough, high quality underclothes had become sought after in Cyrodiil lately and several merchants had begun specializing in them. Julios crept a hand into them and loosely held the Imperial’s testicles. This caught Farrow by surprise and he let out a tiny yelp. 

The eager lizard couldn’t help toying with the Imperial. He rubbed Farrow’s taint with two fingers and nipped at the man’s ears. This brought out a deep, pleasured moan from Farrow. Then Julios withdrew his hand and took a deep whiff. He could smell Farrow’s long travels on them. But the Argonian knew he had to be patient, the ritual required a few more things and he couldn’t let his passion carry him away just yet. 

“Is something the matter? Your teasing is getting quite hard to endure.” Farrow looked annoyed now. I’ve not met many men who take as long as you to get what they want.” 

The Argonian stared back, this time not in a human way, but with a blank, primitive expression. He pulled himself off of the half-Imperial.

“I am sorry for making you wait.” The lizard rubbed his shoulder. “See, I spent much of my childhood in the Black Marsh before settling in Cyrodiil. I’ve enjoyed a degree of freedom that many of my egg-brothers do not share. I prefer to follow the practices of my homeland…and how should I say this?” The Argonian reached a hand back out to the merchant’s own. “Among the children of the Hist, sex is a ceremonial ritual. It washes our souls together and opens up new planes. The rest of Tamriel’s races…are quick to come and quick to leave. We prefer to take our time.” 

Farrow seemed to understand now. Something had led him to Leyawiin for a deeper purpose than just a night of fun. The half-Imperial now regarded Julios as a guide rather than a flirt. 

“Being with you has made me lose track of time completely, to be straightforward.” The merchant joked. “Usually, I’m thinking of the letters I need to send, of ledgers and accounts, of my wares, and of where I want to visit next…but today, none of that.” 

“That’s good. It means you are starting to see through my eyes.” Julios pressed a thumb into the center of Farrow’s palm. “Our people don’t regard time the same way others do. We are less controlled by it.” 

Rain was still pouring over the cobblestones streets of Leyawiin, but in this corner of the city the loudest sounds were wind through the mossy oaks and the rhythmic dripping from its branches. 

“There is one more ingredient we must gather.” The Argonian said.

“What is it?” Farrow asked.

“An herb that grows outside the walls of Leyawiin. It’s a lot easier to find at night. Will you come with me?” Julios pulled the half-Imperial off the messy bed.

“Lead the way.” He responded enthusiastically.





Part 4

The pair snuck outside into the dark rain of the night. Both wore just a pair of work breeches and went without shirts. It was too warm and wet for anything else, and they weren’t expected in polite company. Farrow had never felt so underdressed, but also never as free. He saw that the Argonian left slightly bigger footprints than his own. Farro also watched as Julios’s tail swept back and forth, almost like a rudder for a ship. He could smell the citronella among the lanterned porches of the city, warding off bugs and spirits. Probably warding off strange folk like themselves. The city had large sections within its walls that were full of overgrowth, Julios was leading Farrow to a part he knew where a tunnel led under the walls of the city. Apparently, locals called it the “Skooma Tunnel''. 

When they got there they could see a small camp tucked away where bottles of wine littered the muddy undergrowth and a tarp was pooling with rain. Farrow could tell a group of Khajiit bums were recently forced to find shelter from the rain and left their belongings here. He spotted the tunnel by the riverbed. It looked like a tight fit, but as they approached it seemed to widen up and they could see it went back quite a ways. Water was trickling out of the tunnel, they would have to crawl through the mud. The air suddenly chilled a bit and he could hear ruffling in the distant trees.

“Quickly, dear traveler. Crawl on your hands and feet if you have to, but follow me.” Julios sank to his belly and snaked his way up the wet tunnel. Farrow followed behind, trying to avoid the lizard’s large tail. He had never felt so close to the dirt itself before. Roots hung from above, clouding their vision. The Argonian’s ass led the way, and Farrow couldn’t help thinking about how aroused the day’s journey had made him. He was having more fun than any one date had given him. He thought about thanking the strange voices later, but wondered how the Divine would perceive that. Before he could finish, a thought rang in his head: “You are welcome.” 

They emerged on the other side of the city walls right by the riverbed. It was covered in ferns and moss. They swam across and made their way towards what seemed to be the remains of an Ayleid ruin. It was barely recognizable as such and had become part of the forest. Julios examined a tree bearing layers of oyster mushrooms and took out a small blade, cutting off about a satchel’s worth and stuffing it into his large trouser pockets. The Argonian beckoned Farrow. “Don’t worry, traveler, we are nearly there.”

They clambered up a slippery hill, grabbing fallen-over tree trunks for support. Farrow wanted to grab onto the Argonians' scaled body, but knew he would have to wait. He was enjoying the sort of foreplay that this outing provided. 

In his distraction, Farrow’s foot slipped in the mud and he stumbled forward. The hilltop was covered by a curious bed of glow-in-the-dark blue flowers. 

“It’s the roots that carry their magical properties.” Julios said as he knelt down to inspect them. The rain had calmed to a drizzle and the sky was cloudy, but somehow the forest had its own illumination. Farrow wondered if there was more magic in this forest than others. 

Julios gathered a bunch and stuffed them into his other pocket, before reaching for more. A glimpse of an amethyst light appeared in the bed of flowers. “That’s why…” Pondered the Argonian. Farrow recognized the object sitting in the bed of flowers as a rare gem. He was not well-versed enough in magic to know whether it had power or not, however. “Here. Put this in your pocket. It will serve us well in the future.” 

The weight of the stone in Farrow’s already loose, borrowed trousers made them dangerously close to slipping off altogether. He kept a hand on them as they snuck back through the woods, towards the glow of the city. They smelled the familiar scent of the river, just down another small hill now. 

“When we get back, dear traveler, I will show you how to pre—Aaghhghh” Julios slipped on the mud and tumbled down the slide that the streams of rain had formed. 

“Julios! Are you okay?” The half-Imperial called out, trying to navigate down the sleek terrain. He was unsuccessful and tumbled on his back, crashing into the bank where Julios lay. Both had started laughing. 

“Perhaps we picked the hardest night to do this, dear traveler.” The Argonian slowly stood up and went over to help Farrow up, but instead was grabbed down to the ground by him. “By the Hist!” He cried out. They playfully wrestled, enjoying the comedy of it. Farrow was able to pin him down to the black soil before planting a kiss directly where the nipple would appear on an Imperial. Surprisingly, the Argonian moaned. 

Before Farrow could go back in for another, Julios showed his strength by maneuvering to be on top, forcefully holding Farrow down. The Argonian went directly for Farrow’s neck, biting and kissing. Both had become flushed red, and had nearly lost the contents of their trousers. 

Julios picked mud out of the half-Imperial’s dirty hair. “I know how bad you want to fuck. I can feel it.” They looked at each other. “But it will feel so much better when I prepare these spells. It will be transcendent, you’ll see.” 

Farrow had never been this aroused in his life. His heart was beating faster than if he were jogging. He could hear the sound of boots approaching. “Julios, I think we sho—”

“Halt! Show yourselves, bandits! I know you’re hiding from me!” A Leyawiin guard was waving a torch in their faces. The man could not register what he was seeing. It was two men, one was an Argonian, covered in mud, half-dressed and clearly in the middle of a strange act. “What is the meaning of this? What in the Nine Divines…” The man drew his sword. “I don’t care what your excuse is, perverts. I will bury you right here!” 

Julios looked at Farrow. “Hand me the stone.” He whispered. Farrow remembered what he had put in his trousers earlier, handing it quickly to the Argonian. The Argonian raised the stone, prompting an attack from the guard, but before the sword hit him, they had disappeared. A strange glow of magic trickled from where they used to be. 

Suddenly, Julios’s hand was gripping Farrow’s arm, he was being pulled through the woods at high speed, back towards the bank where the Skooma tunnel lay. They nearly slipped many times, but managed to stumble back. Without looking back, they followed the trail they had taken back to the two story house among the oaks. Both were channeling adrenaline and excitement. 





Part 5

The Argonian brought out a wash bucket and rags and they began cleaning each other. Afterwards, Julios brought out his scented oils, and massaged them into his new lover. After they groomed each other the Argonian went to gather the potions he had prepared for the still-young night. Farrow waited in the smoking lounge. His penis was already throbbing between his legs. He longed for the soft, scaled fingers to caress it. 

From the other room Julios shouted out, “Will you prepare the pipe, dear traveler?” The Argonian was making swishing and gurgling noises, rinsing something. Farrow Responded, “Of course…if I can figure it out.” Farrow picked up the strange canister of smelly herb and packed it into the pipe. He lit a match and began breathing the magic smoke in. It made him very relaxed. After they had cleaned and groomed, the two men had not put any clothes back on but Julios had instead given them both silk robes to wear while they prepared.

 “Blowing rings without me? You are a naughty merchant, indeed.” The Argonian came in, carrying a handful of small flasks. He set the flasks down on the nearby table, after which Farrow handed him the pipe. The Argonian blew smoke out of his nostrils like a dragon would. The sound of owls and cicadas could be heard outside. 

“Let's begin, dear traveler.” He took a seat and pulled Farrow close against him. “I made us three potions. This one will make us last longer and give us stamina. The one in the middle will heighten our pleasure.” Farrow picked up the last one. It was in the smallest container, and made out of what he could tell was sapphire. 

The Argonian smiled. “This allows us to feel each other’s pleasure. I went to great lengths to make it.” Farrow breathed deeply and responded, “Then by the Divine, we shall not waste it.” Suddenly, Julios’s voice echoed in Farrow’s head, “I know you won’t, handsome.” Farrow wondered if the herb was playing tricks on him. 

They each took a few more hits from the pipe and then each took sips out of the three flasks. He felt a certain magical heat fill his groin, the effects of the first and second were already coming in. They went upstairs to the bed where Julios said a few words in an exotic language, and suddenly he felt a light had been turned on. 

“Thank you for being so patient. I knew you would be the right one after the Hist told me where to find you.”

Farrow paused and looked up at the Argonians toned, nude body. “Can I?”

“Please, dear traveler.” Not a second after the words uttered forth were the two all over each other, desperately entwined in a deep kiss. They lay their bodies on top of each other, lining up their hard cocks, eagerly pressing and sliding them together. 

The texture of the Argonians shaft worked itself on the shaft of Farrow. It tickled and shot pleasure up his groin. They thrust and rubbed. The heads of their cocks were on each other, spilling precum out like a river. The Argonian reached towards the bed stand to dip his fingers in a kind of oil, lubing it into their combined shafts. 

Farrow eagerly handled both of their cocks in one hand, sliding it up and down, they both sighed out eager moans of relief. The potion’s effect was the only reason he wasn’t spilling seed all over the both of them.

Julios grabbed Farrow in for another kiss, which he returned warmly. “You pleasure me greatly.” the Argonian whispered in Farrow’s ear. “Before we fuck I’d like you to explore any part of me you want.” They were still thrusting their shafts against each other. “What do you mean?” Farrow asked. 

“I caught you staring at my feet earlier, you dirty traveler. I’ll let you touch them if you want.” Both laughed. Farrow un-pressed himself and positioned himself by Julios’s feet. They were covered in smooth scales. As Farrow was admiring them, the Argonian took the chance to press the sole of his right foot against Farrow’s face. He laughed before grabbing it and feeling it’s strange texture, massaging them was deeply satisfying. 

Then, the Argonian pressed his other foot against Farrow’s cock, pressing underneath the head with his toes. Farrow again felt as if he could orgasm to that sensation alone, but the spell held him back. 

Farrow worked his way up through the inside of the Argonian’s thighs, set on the valuable gem in the middle. He gave it a prompt lick, tasting the rough texture near the base of the shaft. This drew a deep breath from the Argonian. “Keep going. You are doing well.” He cooed. Farrow gave the shaft a longer, rougher lick, appreciating the underside and licking right up towards the Julios’s point head. It was shaped like the head of a slick arrow. He began sucking the ripening cock. Then the third potion’s effect kicked in.

Farrow was feeling sensations that were not his own. In fact, he felt a deep pleasure and friction on his own cock, though clearly servicing the Argonians. He realized this was the effect, and that each was to experience the other’s sensations. With this, he began sucking in longer, deeper strokes. The Argonian was making movements with his mouth.

“It feels like I’m sucking my own cock. How strange.” Julios commented. 

“And I am loving the way your cock feels. I’m clearly getting the better deal.” Farrow responded, but noticed that thinking it alone was enough for Julios to hear. Their thoughts were intermixing, melding them together in a mental embrace.

Farrow gasped with air, he wanted to explore these effects. He looked up at the erect Argonian. “Perhaps we can try going head to cock?”

“Gladly.” Julios responded telepathically. They positioned themselves so that they were able to lay and hold each other, sucking each other’s cocks eagerly, each was now feeling the sensations of both pleasures. It felt transcendent to experience twice, no, exponential, the pleasure. 

To be inside each other in many forms was sensual and comforting. They were flooded with every sensation known to each. Finally, a bursting light appeared in their mind. A euphoric feeling burst from their cocks and washed their sight away with a rainbow vortex. A portal had opened. 





Part 6: Epilogue

“Are we dead?” 

“Yes, dear traveler. We came so hard we died.”

“You are lying, but I believe it.”

A strange land appeared before them. It looked like the night sky had crept into the earth itself. A foggy mist engulfed the forested scene. The red leaves of autumn blew around. Fountains with carvings of strange beings lined this garden. They approached the nearest one and looked in it, seeing their reflection.

In it they saw themselves together. Four eyes stared back on a face that was sculpted like a strange, but beautiful, animal. Horns grew from their heads and they saw a wreath of flowers on it as well. Their skin was like smooth leather, dark green and glowing indigo. They had a tail as well. Both thought together they were a work of art, indeed.

A strange looking woman, pale and taller than them approached. She had glowing eyes. 

“I take it this is your first time here?” She asked.
