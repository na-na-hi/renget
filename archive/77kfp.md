Auntie’s little secret. Ch. 4.

~*~

The bass resonated through your body, party lights shot from side to side, often hitting your eyes, crowds of people swarm by. Someone from your group signaled everyone to follow him and you made your way to a cramped table. Couple of crumbs and wet stains wait for you on top of it. Sitting down, everyone began talking about what to drink and the aspect of the place.

Coming here was a mistake. Impulses bring regret that can last longer than the split second you take to act upon them.

But come on, you could enjoy this, you told yourself. Just try to not think too hard about it and enjoy the evening. Just relax for once. Here come the drinks, and so, begins the night.

With some alcohol in your system, you do become more talkative. The problem is that often a couple of drinks will make you spit out something that you shouldn’t say, and then you’re forced to roll with it.

Today it was one of those days, as you accidentally mentioned something about sex, you can’t be bothered to remember what, but it piqued the interest of the group and a snowball began falling down a hill. One of the girls talks about a crappy blowjob, one of the guys talks about a recent hookup. Now it's your turn. All of their eyes, they’re looking at you and they’re waiting for you to talk. 

Blinding eyes, more disorienting than the party lights. They're scrutinizing you, you know they are.

Think of something, anything. 

A few bits of truth, and few lies dangling from the truths, like branches from a tree. It’s always annoying to talk just because you have nothing to say. They seem hooked on the story you've made from lies, and they’re buzzed enough to not notice the incongruences.

“Anyways, that’s how I lost my virginity and pissed blood for a week.” You finished.

Everyone laughed, even those who didn’t pay attention to you. Perhaps they didn’t want to feel left out. 

“Oh Anon, you’re a mess!” A girl giggled.

You smiled.

A casual drink with your college friends on a summer night. What’s not to love? Other than the fact, of course, that the bar smells like vomit, or that your drink tastes more like water instead of alcohol. 

…

As their laughter dies out, you can feel your social battery draining, and just as another bit of small talk begins, the urge to leave kicks in. Well, it was worth a shot, you tell yourself.

“I’m going home.” You said bluntly.

“Hey, come on, we just got here.” One of the guys spoke.

“Come on!” Another one chimed in.

“I should get going...” 

With that you got up and quietly ran for the door before they could talk you back into your seat. 

Groups of all ages are passing by, from high schoolers, college students and people in office getups. The air smells a lot fresher here, untouched by the filth of the club you just were in. It’s not going to be like that forever, you figure, so you take a deep breath and let it fill your lungs. A nice, refreshing breath...

Fresh air is a relative term, you realize, as the smell of piss lingered in the air, but at least it’s less thick than inside. Best to leave. You stretched your legs.

“Anon!” Someone yelled behind your back. You turned in a panic to see that a short, tanned girl from your group chased after you, and promptly latched onto your arm before you could lose yourself in the crowds.

“Geez, you’re such a mood killer, you know?”

“Uh, yeah, I’m sorry, you know I’m a bit of a social recluse.”

“Just a bit?” She giggled. You forced a smile, you wanted her to stop touching you like she knew you.

“So, where are you going now?” She asked.

“I’m going home, got stuff to do.”

“Ohhh, what stuff?”

“I mean, I… stuff.”

“Okay, but what stuff?”

“Study…”

“We’re on break you nerd! It’s not going to kill you to put down the books for once~” Her tits brushed against your arm.

Dear god. Just fuck off. Please, fuck off. You can't bother with this today.

“I’d just rather be by myself.” You spurted out. "Alone." 

The girl gives you a teasy smile, as if she hadn't listened to what you said or simply didn't care. Your stiff eyes rejected her again, and slowly, she began to understand.

You saw the exact moment when the girl’s expression turned into one of hurt, her mouth slightly gaping and her eyebrows clenching together. Her eyes beamed with surprise, and finally she let go of your arm with dull movements.

“Have fun.” She said, then walked back inside.

You sighed.

~*~

You came back to your apartment, feeling welcome by its dark, claustrophobic walls. You stumbled around, groping your way around furniture and made it to your room. A blue tone dyed the walls, and slowly you got accustomed to it as the shadows began creeping out from under the bed, from under the floorboards.

There’s such a peace that comes not from silence, but from solitude.

You sat before your desk and turned on the lamp. In between textbooks, a few manga and a file with some documents, you brought out a copybook. Not one used for your notes, but for your personal leisure. The cover depicted a couple of ducks, over which you had scribbled an afro on one, and mustache on the other.

Your soul’s personal journal, at last. You opened it and stared at the dot that finished your latest entry, a little memo to finish that book you were reading. I’ll get to it, you promise yourself. 

Ah, the privacy of a blank page. A friend, and an enemy. Look at it, it’s practically asking to be written all over it, you feel its luscious lines urging your hand to grab a pen.

You sighed, and marked down the date first. Then, it's time to take the lead.

“Today I went out with some classmates, and I quickly chickened out.”

“I am a pathological liar.”

“Liar.”

“Liar.”

“One of them wanted to leave with me. I hope I wasn’t too rude when I rejected her.”

“I feel moss. Moss is growing in my brain.” 

Now your mind drew a blank, but you still couldn’t put down the pen. You drew patterns on the corners of the page, a little stickman as well, with uneven arms and legs.

You thought of finishing a poem you had begun writing last week, but you're not feeling up to it right now. Often, one doesn't decide what he writes when he sits down to write.

Might as well give yourself something. Family habits die hard, you realize. You turned on the lights and reached for something in your pantry.

Now you had a box of cheap wine and a lot of nothing to do. A perfect night.

Nothing that disturbs its stellar peace, the stars are still there, even behind the smog tarnishing the sky, your lone companions since forever. 

Summer. 

At some point, summer stops meaning so much other than horrid sweating. You work through its murderous temperature, you get sunburns, you feel sticky for no reason other than walking, you hate bugs... What truly makes it worth something, is remembering what happened in the previous summers.

Friends, periods of time, people you saw, part time jobs, episodes of your life.

Most of them suck, however. There's nothing to come back to to the memories of summer.

Except for... 

Something brews inside you, you remembered what you saw in your dreams last night. Your press the pen down onto the paper, the ink begins flowing.

“I had a dream in which I’m dragging my own guts across the floor as I’m trying to hold them in. I entered a house, a house that was inside another house.”

“Someone greets me. It’s an old man. I’m feeling shameful, judged even, for showing up like this. It was as if I was naked. He greets me normally, as if he didn’t notice, or pretended he didn't. He asks me to come inside.”

“I sit down on a chair and there’s a woman that cries onto her sleeve.”

“I ask her what’s wrong, she just sniffles. For some reason, I feel horribly for her.”

“She said something I can’t remember, and as she does, someone taps me on the shoulder.”

“And I wake up, clutching my stomach, thinking that my guts are about to stain my own sheets.”

“Summer. Such a beautiful shore.” 

“A beautiful night, frozen in a frame perfect instant.”

“I’ve been trying to pick up my past, but it’s scattered all over the place like bits of broken seashells.”

Seashells.

Aren’t they pretty to look at?

~*~

Hana would be home by Sunday. You heard the rustling of the leaves, shaken by a cool breeze as you felt that summer was nearing it's end. Once mom came home, your vacation ends as well. The past few days at your auntie's house have been as happy as they always are with her, with the exception that, besides that one night, luck had dealt you both a bad hand, and rendered you unable to embrace each other.

There's one event in particular that felt as if the universe itself was playing a prank on you. Casualty can feel so comical at times.

Two days ago, while everyone sat down for dinner, Kenji got up and left for the bathroom.

As Fubuki's knife cut through her steak, she sneaked a quick glance to the hall.

"Psst, Anon~" She calls you in a muffled voice.

"Mmm?" You say, chucking another spoonful of mashed potatoes into your mouth. 

After she has your attention, Fubuki puts down her cutlery. She sneaks another glance to the hall. No presence of her husband. She giggles and fumbles with herself for a bit, before she lifts her shirt to flash you her bare chest, wearing no bra. She slyly opens her eyes to get a good luck of your luststruck stare, and just as Kenji's footsteps approach the table again, she pulls it back down and resumes eating.

The image of her perfect breasts, is burned into your mind, the jiggle they had as they fell, how they slapped together, the color of her nipples...

She smirks while she plays with her steak. Her husband doesn't notice when she blows you a kiss.

You finished your meal quickly, and after that, you were hit by the most primal urges coded into your DNA. Waiting for the cover of night, you sneaked out of your room and stood outside her door. In and out, just like last time. 

Fubuki waited for you to open the door while she touched herself, but you weren't showing up.

"Come on... come on..." She muttered.

The door was locked! 

You tried to turn the knob multiple times, as if it would unlock with another turn, but it did not yield. Frustrated, you went back to your bed, and humped a pillow until you fell asleep. 

Your auntie, on her end, was left blueballed until the sun came up.

In the morning, Fubuki wondered why her nephew didn't come to see her, and you wondered why she would lock the door. Neither spoke about it, however. Kenji put down the mystery during breakfast, saying that he had finally fixed the locks on the bedroom.

"Feels great to have time to tend to the home, y'know?" He beams.

"I bet..." She secretly sulks.

Fuck. 

~*~

Today, you’re helping your uncle. He had shown a birdhouse to you a couple of days ago, the proud product of his craft. Now after applying some hand made decals, he asked if you wanted to paint it. Of course, you agreed.

“So Anon, going back to school next week, huh?” Your uncle asked as he watched you paint. “Even it out more here.” He pointed at a spot.

“Mhm.” You replied as your brushed the corners of the roof once again.

“Gonna miss summer?” 

“Not really.”

“Not really? Why not?”

“Summer’s boring, that’s all.” 

“You fought with your friends or…?”

“Mom doesn’t let me go out unless I’m supervised.”

“Ha…” He sulked. There it is again, some old habits seem to be hardcoded into his family’s genetics.

The sun burns over your heads. Kenji looks at you with compassion. 

“Say, Anon.” Kenji spoke.

“Hmm?” You kept painting the roof of the birdhouse.

“What do you say we to go to the beach this weekend?”

“The beach...? Really?” He seemed intrigued.

"Never been to one before?"

"No...?"

“Go ask Fubuki.” Kenji smiled.

“I, um, Should I tell Ha-, m-mom?”

“I’ll talk it out with her, don’t worry.” He winked.

And so you put down the paintbrush, and quickly went to get your aunt with a big smile on your face.

Meanwhile, Kenji looked at the birdhouse and noticed he had missed to put a nail at the bottom.

Whatever, it’s going to hold up, right? He hung it out to dry from the tree. Anon's missing the other half of the roof.

~*~

Her room was neatly organized, everything in its right place. Even the last hairband crawling under the bed was where it was supposed to be. Her white curtains, with blue stripes at the bottom, the door that lead to her little office, her closet in which she kept her idol outfits and her casual clothes as well, souvenirs from the holidays on display...

So why, why did she feel as if she wasn't welcome by her own four walls? Perhaps she can wash the feelings off. Time to grab a towel and relax in the shower.

...

Stepping out and drying her body, Fubuki stared at her reflection, and her reflection stared back.

Now that she could catch a mental break, it downs on her all that’s happened up to this point, and all the events that lead to it.

Not the first time it happened, of course, but every time it did she still had to process it, as if she won the lottery twice in a row. That feeling never goes away. She’s unable to believe that she has crossed yet another point of no return, and all of the consequences that that would imply. At first she felt dread. Now she felt indifferent. That’s what bothered her the most.

Every time she heeds the calls of her passions, she knows she's adding notches to a wall, like she's counting her sins. Every time she entertains the requests of her nephew, knowing fully what she's doing, and telling herself that he knows it too...

That was the last time, she told herself. Never again. But, there have been a thousand 'Last times' before this one, too. 

Anon likes it too, right? It's best if she doesn't think about it too much.

After hours of debating the morality of fucking her nephew, she’d find herself combing her memories for fuel, searching for something to indulge in and touch herself with. Their ruined escapades had left such a sour taste on her mouth. 

The feeling of obscenity, the foul hands of pleasure dug themselves into her cunt and massaged her tits. She kissed her imaginary nephew on his imaginary lips like she had kissed the real one, and wrestled his imaginary tongue inside her mouth. She feels herself getting pounded by his imaginary hips, getting fucked by his imaginary dick, and soon enough, he twitches and shakes in an imaginary dry orgasm while Fubuki squirms.

…

And after everything's done, and her passions retreat out of sight, cowering to the shadows, she's alone with herself again.

Her nephew knocks on her door. Fubuki asks him to wait outside, she's busy with something. He says that uncle Kenji wants to go to the beach, and that he told him to tell her.

With natural cheeriness, she speaks.

"Give me a second, I'll come out in a while!"

Shirakami Fubuki.

Auntie Fubuki. 

Both sides of the same coin.

~*~

“Auntie, auntie.” He speaks.

“Yes dear?” She responds.

“Can you do that thing again?” He blushes.

“Which one?” She smiles.

“The one with your hand.” He points.

She beams.

And her hand caresses his cheek, his expression shows how much he enjoys it, like he's about to disappear into her hand. 

“And the one with your lips?” He asks, blushing a little.

“This one?” She smiles again.

And her lips kiss his forehead, he giggles.

He’s happy.

She swallows.

~*~

After a long 5 hour drive, you arrived at a shack with two rooms to spend the night. Kenji insisted on getting one with two rooms. 

In your memory, the ride was nothing but counting trees and then suddenly your uncle waking you up inside the car. The place was small, but not cramped. It had a kitchen with a stove, a mini fridge and a pantry (all of them empty of course, unless you had paid for the shacks that included breakfast), and even an old, square TV on a shelf. 

Kenji collapsed on top of the bed. His feet were still stepping on the car’s pedals, his hands were frozen as if he were holding the wheel. Fubuki put on some sandals and said she’d go look for a convenience store to buy something to eat, you chimed and asked your auntie to take you with her. She happily takes your hand in hers, and walks outside as the sun sets in the horizon.

You walked through the halls of the convenience store, and picked sandwiches together, talked about mundane things. Both were tired from the drive, funny how doing nothing but sitting in a car can be so taxing. 

“Do you want a chocolate, Anon?” She asks. You nod. 

The cashier made a remark about what a cute son Fubuki had, which caused her to shake. You felt the shift in her mood almost instantly. How exactly is a mystery. Fubuki forced a smile and left with unease. 

Step after step, you knew something was up with your auntie. She was hurt by that comment, and that made you angry.

So what if you weren't her son? To you, she's better than that. Any woman could've been your mother, but only Fubuki could've been your auntie.

Outside of the store, you see a small portion of the shore in the distance, sand illuminated by the reach of the streetlights, and then it becomes darker and darker as it stretches out to meet the sea. A small shack to the left, whose lights shone far in the distance, giving signs of life, and to the right, sand and darkness until it merges back into a regular road of concrete. The waves of the ocean come back and forth, you hear it through your ears. Fubuki noticed your marveled gaze and put away her nasty thoughts so she could pamper you a little.

“Want to go see?” She asks you.

“Yeah!”

Holding you by the hand, Fubuki and you went down to the beach. The place was poorly illuminated, but that made the moon and the stars look shinier than they did in the city. The calming sound of the waves kept rocking your heart’s cradle back and forth. 

You heard Fubuki slip off her sandals, and take them on her hand.

“Ahh, cold!” She shrieked. “Bare sand feels good.”

“Can I try?”

“Sure, but- oh, you don’t have sandals, do you Anon?”

“No?”

“Oh, your feet will get dirty…”

“Too dirty?”

“And wet.”

“I’ll walk back barefoot!”

“You sure?” She giggled.

“Yes!”

"Okay, but be careful."

In a flash you took off your shoes and socks and felt the cold sand shift under your feet. Fubuki and you walked further towards the waves, unable to see were you were stepping. The sand gets wetter as you go, and you feel how it passes between your toes.

Then, water washes over your feet.

“Eeek!” You shriek, Fubuki laughs.

“It’s freezing, isn’t it?”

“Yeah…”

You keep still, letting the cold salt water kiss your ankles over and over again. Something about the moment feels surreal. The moon shines bright, like a hairpin for lady sky, and the stars, droplets of water sprinkled on her wet hair...

Fubuki...

Now you saw her kind eyes again, even in absolute darkness. You could tell they were there, atop her beautiful smile. Fubuki's warmness is so contagious, you could feel it just by standing next to her incandescent heart.

The moon and the stars had had the audacity to reflect on her eyes, to stain them with their light. The starry night would be forever jealous that they got their beauty from being compared to the little emeralds that were Fubuki's eyes.

“Do you like the view?” She asks.

“It's... It's beautiful.” You reply, looking at her figure in the darkness.

“*I felt like I was away from everything, that we were alone together, that she and I were bound to be together forever.”*

*“And to a degree, we are.”*

“*I’ll never be able to erase her name from my heart.”*

“Let’s walk back. Kenji must be starving.”

"Okay."

“We’ll go to a bigger beach tomorrow. Get in your pajamas Anon! the nights on the beach are cold.”

~*~

Fubuki put her hair on a ponytail and wore a long white shirt over her bikini, embarrassed to be seen in it, but wanting to wear it nonetheless. Kenji changed back at the house. Anon dressed up in the same clothes as yesterday, not ocurring to him to just wear his trunks under his shirt. By the time Kenji got the car going, it was already too late. He'll change at the beach, he thought.

Walking towards the beach, they came across some old, beat up changing booths. Kenji opted to go on by himself so he could set up some stuff. 

“We’ll see you there!” Fubuki told him. Anon waved him restlessly.

He went inside the changing booth, disappearing behind the curtain and sat on a bench made out of a single plank of wood. These booths were small, and only gave privacy to the user with a thick blue curtain. Instead of tiles, there was sand on the floor, and the wooden seats creaked with every little bit of weight put on them. The walls were adorned with obscene graffiti, depicting names, penises and sometimes drawings. 

Later they’d see there were modern booths in the more crowded parts of the beach. In contrast, this place seemed like it was up for renovation since the nineties.

Through a small gap between the ground and the hanging curtain, Fubuki looked inside. Not seeing anything, but seeing something.

She’s been in this scenario before, she’s used as it an excuse to... It’s best he does it himself now. 

She fidgeted a lot with her feet and legs, walking in place shifting back and forth… She hears Anon's clothes rustling, his shirt came off, now his pants hit the floor. Stop it, stop it…

Anon, on his side, was fighting the urge to touch himself since the morning. His aunt just looks so erotic wearing nothing but her shirt and her bikini under it, but the best part, the true prize, was her legs, the contrast between the clothed Fubuki and her naked legs was a thing of beauty.

Such an immaculate milky white, such a soft goodness he had felt in his hands. He wanted to be squished between them, he wanted his aunt to wear long dresses solely to tease his eyes with the image of her legs being revealed under them. Oh, her butt must look amazing as well, how different was the bikini from her panties? How much did it show?

His hand unconsciously reached for his crotch, burning for release, and he rubbed himself like he always has with quiet wimps. He'd make it quick, change, and enjoy the beach day with his uncles, but first, he must stop thinking of his auntie, he must calm down his urges...

But there's only so much he could take. A week at her home, only having fun once, feeling invigorated by her tits then suddenly having his fun spoiled...

It's not working, his hand's not enough.

Fubuki waited for her nephew outside, humming a song to herself. Why is he taking so long? She thought. This section of the beach is rather empty. She sees a few people pass by to the prettier parts. Being alone in public is such a deadening moment when you're a walking secret.

“Auntie…” He speaks from inside.

“Anon?” Fubuki asked.

“A-Auntie… Auntie...” He muttered, first to himself, then realized she was listening.

His voice is throwing her off, he sounds like he’s… catching his breath?

“Are you okay? What’s wrong?” He ears perked up, her legs froze in place.

“Auntie, p-please come in…” 

His voice beckons her, putting her in a trance. She knows what’s going to happen if she yields now. 

It doesn't help either that no one is watching. She looks around, and only sees some disinterested middle aged woman walking with a little girl towards the shore. 

One deep breath later, she’s inside the booth.

The first thing she saw was her nephew with his pants hanging from his ankles. His eyes pleaded for help, for release. On top of his orange underwear, his hand is hastily rubbing on his bulge up and down.  First she felt her reasoning physically shut off, her hands feel in complete control, making confident movements. 

Fubuki let the scene seep into her mind, and burned every last detail into her memory. From some obnoxious graffiti, a crack on the booth from which light pierces through, every last grain of sand, and of course, her nephew. She swallowed and got on her knees in front of him, watching him rub himself before speaking. Right now she’s not thinking, all of her thoughts begin and end watching her nephew masturbate in front of her.

“What’s wrong, Anon?~” She muttered.

“I-I feel tingly again…” He whispered.

“Tingly?”

“Mhm…”

“Oww… And what do you want me to do?”

“A-Auntie… C-Could you do that thing again?”

“Which one?~”

“T-The one with your mouth..."

Fubuki swallowed again.

“Mm… Do you want me to, Anon?”

“Y-Yes…” He said, avoiding her luststruck stare.

“Bring them down.”

Quickly, Anon’s hands ran to his sides and pulled down his underwear, his erect cock slingshot onto his belly as his feet kicked off his shorts.

Fubuki was already savoring him in her mouth. She turns around to see that the curtain is still closed.  

What to do, what to do. This moment won’t repeat itself.

“Put your fingers around it.” Fubuki commanded him.

“H-Huh?”

“Come on, don’t you want to feel good?”

“But, um…” 

“I’ll do what you want, Anon, but do this for me first, okay?~”

“O-Okay.”

With some reluctance, Anon’s thumb and pointer finger locked around his penis. He looked at his auntie awaiting instructions.

“Good boy.” Said Fubuki. Those words ran a chilling tour through Anon’s body. “Now, move it back and forth.”

Anon looked at his member, slowly trying to understand what his auntie asked of him.

“L-Like this?” Anon obliged, his fingers sliding across his shaft.

“Mhm! That’s good, keep going.”

Anon felt strange, in the back of his head, something told him not to touch his parts like this, but at the same time, his auntie’s here. She would stop him if he was doing something wrong, right? Despite his exposure to sex, he thought it ended in humping and rubbing, he had yet to learn how to properly masturbate. Now his auntie would be his teacher.

His penis is starting to feel funny again. The presence of his auntie only gets him going more. What’s inside that shirt she wears? Oh, he wants to know.

“Auntie…” He whispered.

“Yes?~”

He swallowed.

“L-Lift… Lift your shirt, please.”

“Why?~”

“I-I…”

Fubuki came closer to whisper in his ear.

“Why, Anon?~” She teased him.

“I… I want to see you…”

“Mhm?~ You’re already seeing me~”

“N-No! I want to see...” He managed to say, before turning into a blushing tomato.

“Ah, you’re such a naughty boy, Anon~” Fubuki spoke. “Oh, but I mean it in a good way, I promise~”

Naughty? You weren’t… naughty…

*Right?*

Fubuki stood up without breaking eye contact. Grabbing her shirt by its lower parts, she slowly took it off. First she showed the lower part of her bikini, a sky-blue that merged nicely with her milky white legs. It looked like a miniskirt, held by a string on both sides. Then, her stomach was revealed, slightly overflowing her bikini, finally, she took it off entirely and showed her nephew the bra that hung from her shoulders with frilly decorations at the bottom, and of course, her beautiful bust under it.

Fubuki threw the shirt on the floor. At first she thought she wasn’t fit for bikinis anymore, but seeing her nephew’s face, seeing his hand rubbing it for her more than made up for it. Her hands ran a tour of her body for him, sensually rising from her thighs, to her hips, across her stomach, under her breasts, squishing them together, slightly lifting them and letting them jiggle for him, then, striking a pose with her hands behind her head and her hips slightly tilted to the side.

“Is your auntie pretty, Anon?”

“T-The prettiest…” Anon spoke while he rubbed himself.

A spark ignited in Fubuki’s eyes as she bit her lower lip.

“Is your auntie sexy?~” She turned around, making sure to bend over slightly so her meaty ass would take a better form.

‘Sexy’. The word felt strangely pleasurable to say, perhaps it was because of the ks sound. 

“A-Auntie’s… sexy…”

“Mhm~… Do you like your auntie?~”

“I… I love her…” He spurts out while he looks at her ass.

Anon’s hand moved faster, Fubuki was hypnotized by his movements.

“Yeah, shake it, shake it for your auntie.” She said as she licked her lips.

Fubuki’s fingers grabbed her bra, and slowly she brought it over her tits, teasing her nephew with the sight of her underboob before her tits fell from it. 

Fubuki swayed her chest from side to side, letting her boobs hang about. Then, she turned around and pinched her bikini from the back. Anon audibly swallowed. Fubuki giggled. Her tail’s moving from side to side, and she begins revealing her behind to her nephew.

Anon’s eyes were glued to the show, his hand was on autopilot while all his conscious actions were towards looking at his auntie’s ass. Her butthole’s about to show...

His hand moves towards his auntie’s ass while he still rubs himself.

“Hey, hey! I found a place!” Someone spoke from outside.

Someone runs over and kisses whoever spoke first audibly. They're really into it to, as heard in their wet mouths.

In a panic, Fubuki brought her hand across her breasts and quickly yelled back just as a man's hand got a hold of the curtain.

“Occupied!”

“Oh sh...! Sorry! Sorry!” The person responded.

Fubuki heard their feet walk on the sand, step after step, a total of fifteen until she couldn’t hear them anymore, and after a long sigh, she turned back to her nephew, who was still holding his little penis in his hand, but kept completely still, giving his aunt a guilty, nervous stare.

Too close. Too, close. God dammit! She never gets to have her fun like she wants to.

But she will, she *will*. Just give it some time.

“Let’s make it quick, Kenji’s waiting for us.” She spoke.

Anon nodded.

Fubuki brushed his hand away and lowered herself to his height. After swallowing her saliva and audibly licking her lips, she made his penis disappear into her mouth in one swift motion, and sucked on it hard all the way from the tip to his base.

Anon muffled his moans and jerked his head back. Fubuki could never get enough of his expressions, always beaming with so much pleasure. And the taste of his member, clean, pure, it fills so nicely in her tongue, it’s so impossibly smooth. It slides effortlessly in and out, each time covered with another thick layer of saliva. Her hand reached for her clit, and began stroking herself in circular motions.

Sucking down to his base, Fubuki slid her tongue out of her mouth, and thanks to Anon’s size, she stretched it out to try and reach his balls, his member still in her mouth. Her hand grabbed Anon by his sides. He giggled.

“A-Auntie!” He smiled. “That tickles!”

Fubuki was lost in the moment slurping on his cock. Her tongue stretched out to trying to get one of his balls inside her mouth as well, but they weren't stretchy enough to get pulled in. She desisted so she wouldn't hurt Anon. 

Fubuki sucked his dick and licked his balls while Anon held onto her head by her hair, whimpering in the same rhythm as his aunt breathing. 

“Auntieeee....” Anon muttered.

Fubuki felt it, he was going to cum soon, so, she took him out of her mouth and slurped on his ballsack, smoothing out all of the wrinkles in it while she spoke to him with a muffled voice.

“Anon, say ‘I’m cumming’ when you feel good, okay?” She jerked him from base to top, her lips sucking on his scrotum.

“What?”

“Say ‘I’m cumming’.”

“I-I…”

Fubuki took his penis back into her mouth, and kept her eyes open waiting to see his nephew cum. Her tongue ran a tour of Anon’s member from all sides while her nephew’s legs twitched in his seat.

“I-I’m…” He spoke. 

“Come on, give it to me…” Fubuki thought while Anon’s penis melted in her mouth.

His auntie’s watching. She wants to hear it. Anon swallowed his scruples and through his teeth, he said the words his auntie wished for.

“I-I’m cumming, auntie I’m cumming!”

Fubuki felt a single thunder of pleasure, striking all of her body at once when she heard those words.

Anon’s legs jerk themselves straight, standing on top of the ground while his butt barely hovered the seat he had been in. He throws his head back like it had snapped and his body shakes all over. His penis was twitching inside of Fubuki’s mouth, all while her tongue assaulted him mercilessly, after a couple of seconds, she let go of her nephew and clenched her teeth while muffled moans of ecstasy escaped her mouth.

~*~

“What are you doing?” Anon asked.

“Cleaning my knees. I got sand all over my legs.”

Fubuki knelt into the sea. Thankfully, she didn’t kneel for long enough for her body to darken. 

With that out of the way, they can go and meet up with Kenji.

They walked towards the beach, and saw it rather empty. The end of summer, everyone's already heading back home.

Kenji stood out in blue greenish trunks next to the parasol.

“Over here!” He yelled, waving at them from the distance. “Geez Anon, where you shopping for a swimsuit or what?” He asked.

“Sorry if we made you worry, honey, Anon got distracted.”

“Doing what?”

Anon blushed, hi uncle noticed his eyes hiding away from him.

“Aww, did you see a cute girl, Anon? Your first summer crush?”

He shook his head, both his uncle and his auntie laughed. Meanwhile Fubuki still savored the taste lingering in her mouth.

~*~

Sandcastles. Decorated with windows made by pushing your thumb inside. Fubuki laying on top of the towel. Kenji falling asleep next to her, the sun kissing his shins that would later burn like hell.

You and your auntie get in the water. You don’t know how to swim, she’s holding you close while she teaches you.

Isn’t it nice to be held?

The sea could swallow you right now. Take you two forever away, and let you float for the rest of eternity, leaving Hana and Yuuto and Kenji behind.

Her heartbeat right up in your ear. 

Like a pacifier for the soul. 

~*~

Sunday came and went. You took a little souvenir from the beach, a white, beautiful seashell. 

You and Fubuki went to get ice cream while Kenji tried to jumpstart the car with a stranger. Once the motor revved up, Fubuki handed him his cone with a smile.

"God, I love chocolate." He speaks, while cleaning the sweat off his forehead.

Another long and quiet drive ensued, silence presented itself in the form of a radio station that played songs from the eighties.

“How was the beach, Anon?” Asked Kenji.

“Great.” You spoke.

“Come on, ‘Great’? That’s it?” Kenji sulked. 

“Dear, he might be a bit meek when he speaks, but you did enjoy it, right?”

“Yes!”

“See that’s more like it, energy, Anon.” Kenji spoke, then giggled.

Fubuki sneaks you a wink through the rear-view mirror.

~*~

At night, Anon went to his room and sank into bed. Fubuki did the same in the kitchen. Kenji couldn’t find rest. Something was gnawing at his head. Something’s gotten him in a bitter mood preemptively, it’s almost as if his body’s getting ready to deal with a hassle.

He turned on his phone, and immediately, notifications shot themselves at him. Work related chit-chat, emails, and one that he feared more. It was his sister. He pinched between his eyes, and called her. A couple of words of formality, and also a sinister tone to Hana’s voice. He knew she had something to say, to his surprise, it wasn't to give him an earful about the trip.

“So, did Anon like the beach?”

“Great, he says.”

“Nice, nice.”

Both held their phones to their ears, mute. Kenji's waiting for it. Hana's probably looking at her nails.

“So, there’s something I need to tell you.”

“Can’t it wait for tomorrow, Hanabi?”

“Don’t call me that.” She fumed.

Why couldn’t it wait? Because she said it couldn’t. 

After they spoke, he looked at Fubuki with dread, and prepared himself for what he had to do.

He took out a bottle of wine he had stored somewhere, and invited Fubuki to accompany him at the table. The air is tensing up, and the sound of the wine pouring into the glass feels like hearing the sound of a gun getting cocked, ready to fire. Fubuki can’t taste her drink. She knows he didn’t just sit her down to unwind.

“Fubu-chan, we have to talk.”

Fubuki spun her glass on its bottom. Oh, it's a little dirty. Water stains. Well, they’re not going to kill her, right? She took a sip of her wine. Sweet, and berry flavored.

“Are you listening?” He asked.

“...improper.” She replied, swirling her wine.

“Huh?”

Fubuki looked at the stains once more. One, two, three, four, that one’s almost faded, but five...

“Isn’t it a little improper? Bad taste? To speak about that after we just got back. It’s like bringing politics into a family dinner…”

“I need to tell you something, that’s all.”

“Hana called. I already know what you're going to say.”

Kenji sighed. 

“No, you don’t. It’s important.”

“Save it.”

“Huh?”

“I said save it. Come on, what are you going to tell me that I don’t know already?”

“Shirakami, Hana’s going to cut you off.”

Fubuki’s face twisted in shock. Those weren’t the words she expected him to say. Her pupils shrunk and stared blankly at her husband, then at her glass. 

Water stains.

Kenji couldn’t find a way to break her gaze, so he just poured himself some more wine and gulped it down. 

“Cut me off? As in… As in I’m not Anon’s babysitter anymore?”

“Yep. Hana thought she’d take some weight off your shoulders, since you have your idol life to take care of and-” He spoke.

“What?!”

Kenji’s head began pounding like his brain was being constrained by a shrinking skull. Here we go.

“You heard me.” He spoke.

“Wha- Why?!”

“Again, she says she won’t bother us anymore, she’ll take care of her own house, she’ll let Anon come home by himself and-”

“Won’t bother us anymore?” Fubuki smiled sarcastically. “She’s going to leave Anon alo-”

“She’ll leave him food, or money.” He cut her off. “He’ll have his video games, his books, she’s going to teach him how to use a telephone so he can call in case he needs help.”

“In case he needs… Oh my god I’m going to…”

“Going to what? Anon’s growing up, Fubu-chan.”

“He’s turning 10 this year, Kenji. 10.”

“At that age I was already cooking for my little sister, you know. He needs to man up a little.”

Man up a little. Fubuki was speechless. Turned into a furious mess, she spoke without thinking or filtering anything she had to say.

“Just…. Just… What is that... woman, thinking?! Is she mad about us going to the beach?”

“Shirakami.” Kenji fumed.

“Why is she so mad? Huh? Oh wait, is she still bitter about my birthday letter?”

“Oh, Fubuki… Let it go…” Kenji brought his knuckles to his forehead, knowing fully what Fubuki was about to do.

“Hana fumed when she found out and she only did because *you* told her!” Her finger pointed at her husband.

“Well it was an accident, I just mentioned it casually!”

“She scolded Anon over it, Kenji, over nothing. And I know she did because *he* told me.” Fubuki remarked. “Do you have any idea how it feels to hear him say his mother yells at him like he’s talking about being bummed out by homework?” She glared. "I was scared shitless thinking that she beat him too!"

"Oh come on, you know she doesn’t do that.”

“Anymore, you mean” She said, pronouncing the last part harshly as she turns away from Kenji. 

“Shirakami, calm down…” Kenji glares at her.

Oh, right! Her abusive bitch of an in-law is a petty cunt who can’t stand the thought that her son loves Fubuki more than her, and now she's taking him away! Now why doesn’t she just calm down a little? Let's be reasonable, it's not like this entire ordeal has been a fucking circus from the get go.

Whatever happens after she opens her mouth now, will be the trouble of tomorrow’s Fubuki. She readies her lips, her tongue, and says something she’s held onto for a long, long time.

“Just because Hana sent you to fight me doesn’t make her right. Why won't you take my side for once?”

“Hana sent me to… What the fuck are you on about?” Kenji's eye twitches, challenging Fubuki to repeat herself.

“Every, single, time. Every single time that Hana looks at me with those eyes, she keeps shut, but then! Oh, you feel like talking! You feel like bringing up that Anon hugs me too much when he’s over or that I’m kissing him too exaggeratedly...” Fubuki swallowed before she mentioned the next part. “And that it’s unhealthy, and weird, and, and… That it needs to stop…”

The last part of what she said had just seeped into her own mind, and she had cornered herself with her own thoughts. She’s crumbling, what she did yesterday, what she’s done.

Like a jester being told to dance.

Being put on the spotlight makes him move.

Even after his limbs have given out.

“Fubuki, quit it…” Kenji spoke.

In one last attempt to run away from those thoughts, she deflected the topic.

“It’s not my fault your sister's a bitter cunt!”

Kenji bolted up from his seat. "You'll show respect when you talk about my family!”

~*~

The discussion became a blink in her memory.

Kenji took the wine bottle to the car and stayed there.

Fubuki sobbed onto her arms. 

Dammit. It didn’t need to escalate to that. It’s just that she felt so… undignified. 

And now that Kenji’s out, she can’t run away from herself. 

How, how can she stop now? When she had first met Anon, he was like a stray puppy that knocked on the door to her heart, begging for an ounce of tenderness. She met him when he was still covering his face in reflex after a mistake. She saw him slowly warm up, like seeing a flower bloom in real time. 

And then, dread creeps over her, and she shivers under its shadow.

The bitter realization that ‘those’ thoughts were still present then, in every tender memory made Fubuki want to vomit. Even when she’s been keeping him close to her heart, she still looked at him that way. 

Those thoughts. They never go away. They never do.

Anon, Anon, Anon...

“Auntie.” He spoke.

His voice sent a freezing shiver down her spine and quickly she regained her composure.

“Anon…? You're still awake?” She spoke slowly in a low raspy voice.

Anon stood next to Fubuki, and after looking at her distressed face, he hugged her.

“Anon… What’s this about? Is something wrong?”

“You and uncle fought.” He spoke.

Fubuki’s eyes went null. 

“I’m sorry you had to hear it.” She said.

“It’s okay. Are you okay, auntie?”

“I am…”

“But why are you crying?”

“Eh…? Oh, it’s nothing...”

Anon held her with more intent. Fubuki shifted the chair in place and now her nephew could get a better hold of her. Without thinking, she brought his leg over her own, and Anon sat on top of his auntie.

“Why did you come out, Anon?” She asked him with a knot in her throat.

“I wanted to see you were okay.”

“Ha…” Fubuki smiled inside. “You came to hug your aunt because of that?”

“Yes. You always hug me when I’m sad.”

The clock is ticking the night away. Each second is stretching out like hours. All Fubuki felt was her nephew’s weight on top of her legs while his arms comforted her, and all Anon felt was the smell of Fubuki’s hair and her soft thighs under his legs.

“I’m sorry, auntie.” He spoke.

“For what?”

“Because you and uncle fought because of me, right? Is it because of what we did?”

“Oh, no! Anon, it’s not like that, it’s… it’s.. complicated, it’s adult stuff.”

Adult stuff. The go-to jack of all trades from the deck of lies.

“I heard my name…” Anon sulks.

“Anon, please, believe me. It’s not your fault.”

Threading carefully, Fubuki searched for the right words to say, not wanting to spurt out a comment that her nephew could misinterpret. Right now, it’s as if she’s walking barefoot, trying to avoid pieces of broken glass, but everywhere she steps, there’s something waiting to pierce her. In the end, she couldn’t manage to say anything worthwhile.

“I’m… I’m sorry Anon. I know it’s a lot to take in but, please, just believe me that it’s not your fault.”

“It’s okay, it happens a lot between my mom and dad too. They also fight a lot because of me.”

“Anon...!”

Oh, the poor thing. His voice is damp with a need to cry. It’s a deeper sadness, one that Fubuki felt familiar with. Like the oppression one feels in their chest when they’re a kid, and they get lost in a supermarket.

“Auntie…” 

“Yes?”

“Will you forgive me?”

...

Her hearts still beating. She’s still here. A chilling sensation ran through her body, her tails shot horizontally, as if her fight or flight response had crawled out from her instincts in face of death.

A warm memory crossed her mind.

One of purity. One so perfect not even her lust could taint it.

"It's not... it's not your fault..." She mutters.

~*~

She heard the bubbles rising from the pot, and lifted the lid from the stew. The delightful smell reached her nostrils and caused her to involuntarily sigh in pleasure. The rain falls atop the roof.

It was a perfect evening in autumn. As gloomy as these days get, you get a taste for home cooked meals and nice company. There’s nothing more heartwarming than a nice meal, well shared between two happy hearts in a quiet table, in a quiet home. 

Anon’s in the living room, she remembers. For the past few days he’s been fixed to an old encyclopedia Kenji had lying around. 

There was something beautiful about this day. She knows exactly what.
 
“Auntie! Auntie!” He came rushing to the kitchen, beaming with a happy, proud smile.

“What’s the matter Anon?” Fubuki turned away from the stove.

“I know how to read!” He said.

“Ohhh, really? Show me, show me!”

After Fubuki turned the stove on low heat, Anon grabbed his aunt’s hand and brought her to the living room, where an encyclopedia laid open across the couch. He’s so excited! It’s like he’s about to bring her to an adventure, his enthusiasm is enough to light a spark in her own mood.

That’s not her couch, however…. No, wait, it is. It just happens to be the older one Kenji brought over from their old apartment. That couch… it would look so strange if it wasn’t so raggedy. She remembers it fondly, the nights making love on it, and now, the evenings with her nephew when he was just barely turning 6.

Anon laid on top of his stomach and searched the paragraph he was reading originally. When he found it, he cleared his throat.

“Squid are, a member, of, the cepa- cephalo- cephalopod family. They have, large eyes, soft bodies, eight, arms, and, two, tentacool- tentacles...”

Fubuki placed a hand on her chest and watched the scene unfold. Anon hit a few bumps in the road with words he didn't know, then turned his gaze to Fubuki, who silently cheered him on until he got it right.

When he was finished, he looked proudly at his aunt while Fubuki’s tears of joy escaped her eyes.

"Auntie?" He says, intrigued by the two shiny drops sprouting from his auntie's eyes.

"Oh, it's nothing." She hugs him and gives him a deep kiss on his cheek, making Anon blush and happily hug his aunt back.

She told Anon he could keep the encyclopedia. Kenji wouldn't miss it. Her nephew beamed when he heard her.

When Hana picked up her son that evening, she saw him happily holding the thick book in his hands.

“Oh?” Hana spoke. “Anon, give that back to your aunt.”

"Oh, it's okay. I gave it to him." Fubuki said.

"Ah, but Fubu-chan, he doesn't know how to read, not yet.”

Fubuki’s eyebrows perked up. 

“Anon, why don’t you tell us about squids again?” She asked of him. Anon, nervous, frantically flipped through the pages until he found one about octopi. Not the same, but close enough. Hana stared blankly at the scene, being washed over by complete disbelief. Her son cleared his throat.

Anon read the entry in the page, this time, with a lot more confidence and eloquence. He blushed looking at his aunt after he finished. 

Fubuki clapped excitedly, then she turned to share her joy with Hana, but all she saw…

All she saw was a glare of jealousy and anger.

~*~

Fubuki sniffled.

“Anon..." She held him close again, she clutched him in her arms as if letting go would mean losing him to oblivion.

"Yes?"

"I'll love you forever. Please believe that, okay?"

"I'll love you forever too, forever and always!"

She cries, Anon panics.

"Auntie...? What's wrong?"

"Anon..." She sniffles. "Will you do something for me?"

"M-Mhm?"

"Follow me." She stood up.

~*~

In her bedroom, she closed the door behind her. In bed, Anon began undressing. Fubuki stops him.

"Oh, no, no Anon! It's not that."

"Huh? But I thought you liked to-"

"Yes! Yes I do, but it's something different, please."

"Hmm?"

Fubuki laid across the bed and sighed. She taps on her stomach.

"Here, I want you to sleep with me."

"O-Okay...!" He beams.

Anon climbs on top of his aunt, he giggles as her soft hands put him under a spell. Soon he falls asleep under her breasts.

And there she holds him in the most innocent of manners. Like how she'd comfort him after rough days at school. What Anon didn't know, was that this was Fubuki's own therapy. Anon sleeps like a baby atop of her, and that's what made her so happy. He feels safe, he feels loved, he feels cared for, and she knows her feelings weren't misplaced on him, even with all the baggage that came with it, even if she had roped him into her darker side. But that doesn't matter. For now, she wants comfort. Everything's perfect right now, why hurry the arrival of tomorrow by dreading it?

Fubuki caresses his head, as if she's kissing him goodbye. When he was younger, she'd cover him with her sheets and see him bulging out of her stomach like she was pregnant. 

"Anon's my son." Fubuki says. "Because I am the one who taught him how to love."

No matter what anyone thinks, no one can change her mind. Her little Anon was her own son. 

"You'll always be welcome in my heart." She mutters as his soft breathing escapes his mouth. "You can live forever with me, as a little bird inside of it. I'll make you a little birdhouse, and a little garden. And no matter what happens tomorrow, please believe, please know, that I'll always think of you dearly."

Anon shifts in place, looks like he's fallen deeper into his sleep.

After Hana takes him away, this will be over. For his own good, for her own good.

She'll make things right.

The TV flashes it's bright light on their bodies. Some game show about people getting slapped with pie.

Fubuki closes her arms around Anon, and she falls asleep.

~*~

And after the morning came, it was like nothing had happened between anyone. Daily life tends to be like that. Everyone has their breakfast, and they go about their day.

Hana came to pick up Anon, and Fubuki waved him goodbye as he disappeared behind the door frame. Now she looks at her hand and contemplates the gift he gave her before he left, the seashell he had picked up at the beach.

The days went by. She didn’t see Anon. Hana didn’t talk to her. Kenji didn’t talk about it. For hours she’d sit in her kitchen, looking at the present her nephew had given her. Her home's gotten dirtier, as if in a split second everything was covered in white dust. 

A new chance, for a new beginning, Fubuki thought. 

You looked at the map the guard had given you.

She’d pass the day by looking blankly at her wall, then sighing. Whenever she saw her nephew, she had to be firm, and not bend her will.

This is the bus! You hopped in, greeting the driver respectfully, he lets you in for free and you thank him as you grab a seat.

“Anon, Anon, I just hope one day you will forgive me.” She spoke. “I don’t want to...”

“Is this my stop?” You asked the driver. He told you it was the next one. You became excited once you recognized the streets you were in and stood right next to the door, waiting to step out.

“Anon…” Fubuki sulked.

Someone knocked on her door, shaking Fubuki out of her train of thought. 

“Eh?” She got up and walked over to the front door, seeing no one through the peephole.

“Auntie, it’s me!” You spoke.

“Eh?!”

Quickly, she opened the door and saw you, still wearing your school uniform and your backpack. 

You beamed as soon as you saw your auntie.

“I took a bus all by myself!” You said.

“Anon..! Why are… what are you doing here?”

“I wanted to see you, auntie.”

Fubuki swallowed.

"B-But, Hana, your mom, did she give you permission or...?"

You looked at her with confusion, then shrugged it off.

"This will be our secret!" You stretch your pinky out to Fubuki, who takes it in her hand without second thought.

As she let you in, Fubuki faced a terrifying realization. 

“I’ve already ruined his life.”

And then, you tug on her shirt's neck, and you offer her your lips. Fubuki takes your lips into hers, your tongue licks them in an inviting gesture.

She feels hot.

"I guess it can't be helped, right?~" She thinks.
