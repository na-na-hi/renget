I love Mimori
I hope this helps you

Will add challenges when they unlock, or some time before. (They'll just be video links).

Please reply to OP if you have suggestions, I'm busy most of the day. I'm sorry.
Having them be replies to OP makes it easy for me (and others) to see

Please post Miyoshi Takane? She's very cute

**WILL ADD: Mass Erosion, and how to defend against it** (so you don't spend 999999 ap on reclaiming your tiles)

#A-HA Conquest Route
Because I can make lines on MS Paint at 12 midnight like a drunken sailor.
Alternate routes on Zone 3 and 4 provided by a certain Kisaki simp.  A bird told me of this info, thank you very much.

##MASSIVE disclaimer: The sweep counts are assuming 6 students for bonuses. Adjust accordingly if you're missing a few.


**After you're done with this, farm materials based on what you need, clearing all tiles starting from Zone 4 and downwards, or upgrading bases (see below).**
- Ideally you should clear all tiles first then upgrade bases then farm. But go in any order you want, play what's fun for you

####Zone 1
https://files.catbox.moe/i8tm92.png
Follow this route, sweep 42 times at the first spot. Another 42 times at the boss.

####Zone 2
**Zone 2 requires 500 Multi-Dimensional computational units to unlock**
https://files.catbox.moe/pci30j.png
Sweep 68 times on bear.

####Zone 3
**Zone 3 requires 2,000 Dimension Engine Parts to unlock**
https://files.catbox.moe/5ymifv.png
No sweeping, just clear mobs. Follow both routes to unlock the boss.

**Alternate route:**
https://files.catbox.moe/aghcsu.png
Use 5 less AP, that's all

"But what do you mean no sweeping?"
Please see Zone 1 and 2 above

####Zone 4
**Zone 4 requires 2,000 Space Choco-Burgers to unlock**
https://files.catbox.moe/8nqawu.png
No sweeping, just clear.

**Alternate route:**
https://files.catbox.moe/ivb0fh.png
Take two empty tiles instead of fighting the Justina followers. One more tile that counts towards small Credit gain through Settlement

#A-HA Conquest Upgrade Route

FAQ: **But why like this and not just upgrade whatever I feel like?**
Because upgrading the ones that take lesser resources first and saving the costly ones for later is more efficient.

##Round 1

**Upgrade the bases in order shown to LEVEL 3**

**Zone 4:**

(Added how Erosion looks + Large-Scale Erosion warning since I had it)
- Thank you 443496474 (in #3283) for pointing out a mistake. Sorry for getting to it so late
- The mistake marked the mob below 2 as the second upgrade in Zone 2. But you do that in Round 2 instead. I have no idea how to word it, just know this image is correct now

**Zone 1:**
