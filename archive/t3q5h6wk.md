## Cope to Weakness
In a squat with a furrowed brow, her yankii spirit starts to grow. Without charging her yankii spirit, she'd stand no chance against the bancho who visited her the night before. In this dilapidated building, Suki recalled him telling their plan to claim this building... as a piece of their turf. That is unacceptable.

Pay attention now, for this is how rival delinquents interact.

One, a **stare down**. The bancho's eyes, black and languid, and the sukeban's slit yellow eyes, confronting the hollow blackness of his gaze. A **menchi beam**, is what they're called. Laser beams shot from their eyes, forces clashed, an invitation to challenge between two delinquents.

Two, a **shout down**. The bancho's voice so low, "This territory's no place for a girl, you know."

"I'm not leaving wisssout a fight!" hissed the sukeban with might.

There was supposed to be a third, a **beat down**. But the bancho, surprisingly kind for his kind, delayed it for another day of life.
"I'd like to let you know, I am a real man. And real men are gentle with gals. Consider this mercy." 

The bancho departed, a cloud of gloom trailing him. But if he returned with a frown, finding Suki still here might bring trouble to town.

So, here she squats tonight, charging up her yankii spirit, ready for a fight. From the opened door, she saw an aura of blackness permeating around a figure, as if it were ink blots on a canvas...

**The bancho is here!**

Suki tensed, charged and ready, rising to her feet. But something seemed quite amiss. He had somebody with him.

"Salutations, missus!" An androgynous looking person appeared. There were extended S's from his "missus," as if he was mocking her lisp.

"Your lackey?" Suki said with a sneer, "A handicap match is not sssomething a real man would want, my dear." She wore a smug grin (behind her mouth mask.)

"You've got it all wrong. I won't interfere in the middle of your fight, Suki," the bancho replied, surprisingly calm. "This whole gang war thing isn't suitable for women. You ever wonder where your gang went? Sukebans often end up either dead or in better schools, leaving behind their pasts."

The bancho gestured towards his effeminate companion. "Couldn't find a woman, so I picked someone close, just to give you a fighting chance. But if for some reason you don't want to fight, you are always free to go since I really don't want to waste my time..." He whispers, "*...with small-time asswipes.*"

The effeminate thug moved gracefully, with a subtle feminine flair. "Yo, just to let you know, I'm a real dude before you jump to any preconceived notions." 

"You brought a random nobody for me to ssrassh? (thrash)" Ignoring what he just said, Suki pointed at the thug, casting a disgusted look at the bancho.

The feminine fellow pointed to the bancho, "Hey now, unlike this fella, I've no qualms about hurting women, I tell ya!" He shouted at Suki.

With an unlikely tinge of compassion in the bancho's dark eyes, "Last chance. I don't want to see a woman hurt... Leave. Not just this place, but this entire gang nonsense as well."

Now picking up where we left off, we finally have three, a **beat down**:

With a middle finger, Suki shouted. "Go To Hell!" She swung her bat with all her might to the effeminate man, yet he effortlessly caught it with a single hand. A gorilla grip, an uncomfortable contrast to that of his delicate nature. Suki stood there, stunned that her swing was effortlessly halted by a clean, slender hand. And with an effortless grip, he shattered the bat, severing it and leaving its tip adorned with sharp wooden stakes. In a desperate move, she tried to use it as a makeshift weapon, attempting to stab him, but a slap met her face instead. An unexpected move, despite how befitting it is to an unmanly man. Time seemed to freeze as she felt a profound sense of humiliation as she was on the process of being effortlessly dispatched by a seemingly weak foe. In a last ditch effort, she kicked his balls. But for some reason she was sent reeling as her leg met an unexpected resistance underneath, something metallic.

"Sssss!" Suki hissed as she recoiled.

"Ah." The effeminate man uttered.

Suki crumbled down with a wince, her eyes on the brink, a single tear fell down.

Suki then glared at her foe with anger so hot her face contorted, "What sa fuck was-" and then a superkick flew to her jaw, producing a melodic note like how the sweet chin music drew. Her irises shot upwards, exposing the whites of her eyes. Her forked tongue protruded outside her mouth, as if she were a dead fish and her limbs splayed out like a starfish.

The victor turned to the bancho and asked, "Well, what do we do with her now, boss?"

The bancho responded, "She doesn't belong here. Been skipping classes and such, acting quite the fool. Soon, she ought to return to school."

"What school?"

"I don't know, you could always just check her phone."

"That uniform looks like it's from Shiketsu."

"You sure that's where she's at? She's been hopping from school to school as if it were a vacation."

The next day, she awoke with a piercing headache, and her jaw's still throbbing in pain. The unforgiving floor beneath her had left her back aching, and the unfamiliar surroundings raised a question: Where had those thugs taken her? As Suki tried to get up, she found a note in her hand. "A piss of paper?" she asked as she looked around. It wrote: "Do not come back." 

Suki reflected on the events of the previous night. As perhaps the last remaining member of her crew and the only one guarding the territory, her stronghold had been compromised by a rival gang. Going back seemed futile, for she couldn't even defeat a single lackey. It was a harsh blow to her pride.

"I'm weak..." she admitted with clenched fists and watery eyes. In these times, strength is key. Yet, she felt like a faceless thug, weak as could be. Just a random soul in the ruthless night, swiftly defeated, out of sight. 

As she pondered, a persistent desire echoed in her mind, "I want to be stronger!" But doubts crept in, a heavy, thick brew.

She was searching for the reason of these doubts, yet she found none to view, perhaps this reflected her potential for growth; just a whole lot of nothing. In a relentless struggle against this notion, she repeated to herself, "Be stronger." However, a different desire bubbled up and escaped her lips: "Friends." In that moment, her heart lightened, and a surge of satisfaction washed over her. Is this what she wants?

"Yeah..."

Maybe trying to get stronger is a bit of a challenge, a bit out of sight. But finding friends? Now, that's a delight. To the school she goes, with a skip and a hop, she found herself standing in the... Shiketsu hallway? Those thugs brought her here, how did they know where she studied? A bit concerning that she doesn't know the layout of her school too, that's a constant absentee for you. No matter, if she wanted friends, stepping into class for a chat seemed key. But having somebody who's often missing might bring on some awkward vibes, and that lisp? Well, that just adds to the mix.

Suki tried to find the classroom she was supposed to be in, but being a constant absentee, she did not know. She circled the hallway, unaware that the thug also had left some lollipops inside her pocket as a token of pity.
