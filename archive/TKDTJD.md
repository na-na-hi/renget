>Hezbollah's attacks on the Lebanese-Palestinian border today are considered the most severe since the beginning of the war, whether by using Burkan missiles, which turned the Baranit barracks into a junk yard, or by using kamikaze drones while intensifying the Kornet missile attacks, targeting occupation army troops and damaging its vehicles, let alone sniping operations. This development has been noticed after blinding the enemy on its northern front by destroying most of its radars, censors and cameras.. etc, and taking advantage of the IDF's lack of long-war capacity by engaging progressively, along with a very essential factor, which is a significant development in dealing with the Israeli UAV attacks

>Statement by the Yemeni Armed Forces Spox, Yahya Sarae:
The Yemeni Armed Forces announce targeting 2 container ships, “MSC Alanya” & “MSC PALATIUM III,” headed towards israeli ports, with anti-ship ballistic missiles. The operation aims to defend the oppressed Palestinian people currently facing killing, destruction, and siege in the Gaza Strip.
This operation follows the refusal of their crews to respond to the warnings and messages issued by the Yemeni naval forces.

We reassure all ships heading to ports worldwide, except Israeli ports, that they will face no harm. They are advised to keep their identification systems open. The Yemeni Armed Forces will not hesitate to target any ship that violates the principles outlined in our previous statements.

We affirm our commitment to preventing all ships destined for Israeli ports from navigating in the Arabian and Red Seas until the needs of our steadfast brothers in Gaza for food and medicine are met.

>This is why you should NEVER trust a mainstream media, such as Al Jazeera, for distributing out-of-context translation attributed to the Iranian IRGC spokesman.

He didn’t mean or say that Al-Aqsa Flood was in response to Martyr Soleimani’s assassination, listening to entire speech, you’d understand that he was referring that Iran’s contributions to Al-Aqsa Flood and possible assassinations & neutralising of key elements inside israel are also part of the grand revenge of Qassem Soleimani.

Iran has always stated that the ultimate revenge of Qassem Soleimani is the exit of foreign troops from the region and the elimination of israel is part of that, and so assisting with the Palestinian resistance’s Al-Aqsa Flood is part of Iran’s revenge. He didn’t say Al-Aqsa Flood is a response to the assassination of General Qassem Soleimani.

I agree, the wording was a little confusing and spokesperson delivered a poor job in expressing his intentions but the fact that this triggered a response from Hamas should tell you how strong PsyOps and mis/disinformation is.

The "Israeli" occupation army targeted and destroyed more than 200 archaeological and heritage sites out of 325 sites in the #Gaza Strip, including ancient mosques, churches, schools, museums, ancient archaeological houses and various heritage sites, in a failed attempt to obliterate the #Palestinian cultural and heritage presence and an attempt to obscure historical evidence and historical depth. #Palestinians in the #Gaza Strip.

The most prominent sites destroyed by the occupation army: (The Byzantine Church of Jabalia, the Al-Omari Mosque in Jabalia, the Sheikh Shaaban Mosque, the Al-Dhafar Damri Mosque in Al-Shuja’iya, the Al-Khader Shrine in Deir Al-Balah, the Balakhiya Site “Anthedon Port” northwest of Old #Gaza City, and the Khalil Al-Rahman Mosque in The Abasan area in Khan Yunis (south of the #Gaza Strip), the center of ancient manuscripts and documents in #Gaza City, and other important archaeological and heritage sites.

In the #Palestinian territories, the occupation is trying to change its features through bombing and direct targeting.

>In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
" So do not weaken and do not grieve, and you will be superior if you are [true] believers." (Quran 3:139)

Greetings to the steadfast and patient masses of our people,
You are the honor of the Islamic nation, showcasing to the world the true meaning of patience. Against the rock of your resilience, all conspiracies hatched against you shatter.

May Allah have mercy on the martyrs of our people, and we pray for the swift recovery of our wounded enduring the hardships of the blockade, shortages, and the denial of medical treatment. May freedom come to our prisoners facing the mistreatment reflecting the moral bankruptcy of this rogue entity.

To our brave fighters from all factions of the resistance,
Your courage resonates with both foes and friends alike. Your bravery has shattered the false pride of the oppressive enemy, etching the historical significance of Palestine in the minds of the free world.

Special commendation to the Mujahideen Brigades who, through special operations in various combat zones, seized diverse weapons from the Zionist enemy. Their achievements include obtaining a medium weapon of the MAG type and an M16 rifle from the enemy, along with ammunition boxes, LAW missiles, turning unexploded enemy shells into lethal improvised devices. May Allah bless these courageous efforts and crown their perseverance with manifest victory.

Concerning our enemy's prisoners, we previously declared that the enemy targeted some of our captives. They show no regard for the lives or suffering of their own prisoners. The siege and starvation affecting our people extend to our captives, as their areas are bombarded. If the enemy desires the release of their prisoners, they must cease their aggression entirely and withdraw their forces from our beloved land.

To the masses of our Islamic nation,
In your name and in the name of our people, we salute all who supported and stood by us, particularly those in military positions. Special acknowledgments to the Islamic resistance in Lebanon, the Yemeni forces, Ansar Allah movement, and the Iraqi resistance factions.

In conclusion, we mourn our martyrs, and we pray for the swift recovery of our wounded and the freedom of our captives. "And Allah will surely support those who support Him. Indeed, Allah is Powerful and Exalted in Might." (Quran 22:40)
