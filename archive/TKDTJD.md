>Hezbollah's attacks on the Lebanese-Palestinian border today are considered the most severe since the beginning of the war, whether by using Burkan missiles, which turned the Baranit barracks into a junk yard, or by using kamikaze drones while intensifying the Kornet missile attacks, targeting occupation army troops and damaging its vehicles, let alone sniping operations. This development has been noticed after blinding the enemy on its northern front by destroying most of its radars, censors and cameras.. etc, and taking advantage of the IDF's lack of long-war capacity by engaging progressively, along with a very essential factor, which is a significant development in dealing with the Israeli UAV attacks
