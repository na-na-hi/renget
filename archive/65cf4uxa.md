Slamming your hands on the table in mock rage, you cried out, “Mommy! Mommy! I’m hungry. I want dinner.”

Mio blushed, “I’m not your mom, stop calling me that.”

“Sorry, but you said dinner would be ready two hours ago. You’d expect anyone to throw a tantrum after waiting that long.”

Mio closed the door to the pantry, “I know and I’m sorry about that. There just isn’t any food anywhere in the house. I’ve been searching and searching and all I could find was a bag of rice. I don’t get it, it’s like all the food in the house suddenly vanished.”

“Maybe it was a gnome.”

“It wasn’t a gnome,” Mio walked over to you and threw her hands around your neck. Tonight, she wore nothing but a tan colored apron. She rubbed her soft hands on your chest while humming into your ear. You felt yourself calm down as you often did around Mio. That was always an effect she had on people. She sighed, “Looks like we’ll be having rice tonight,” she nuzzled up against you, “and to think I wanted to make something for your special day,” Mio slid her hands farther down your body sending electric tingles up your spine, “Hmm? Are you okay with that?”

“Y-Yes, of course,” you turned to face Mio, “I really am sorry about how…” your voice trailed off as you got lost in Mio’s warm, amber eyes. They gave off a comforting feeling that made me you feel giddy inside. Or maybe that was because you were looking at the love of your life whose slightly chubby face makes your day better whenever you look at it.

Mio leaned in close enough that you could feel her warm breath. Her wet lips touched yours forming a kiss that lasted less than a second. You searched her beautiful eyes as she slowly pulled her head away from yours letting you savor her kiss. She whispered, “Behave yourself and there’ll be more where that came from,” and winked.

You nodded in response which was the only way you could respond. Plus, you didn’t want to accidentally admit that you were hard as a rock. Mio turned around and walked away exposing her rear end and her short black tail to you. Her ass was toned from all the dancing she did despite the fact that she wasn’t getting any younger. She took out two wooden bowls and two wooden spoons from a cupboard then grabbed the bag of rice as well as some salt and pepper from the pantry, setting all items down on the sink.

“We still have spices?” you asked.

“Yeah,”

“That’s good.”

Mio opened the bag of rice when suddenly her stomach growled like it had never growled before. She clenched it and keeled over having to place her free hand on the sink to keep herself from falling over.

You stood up, “Mio, are you okay?”

“I’m fine, that fish I had last night made me sick.”

You patted her on the back, “If it hurts too much, you can always lay on the couch. I know how to put rice in a bowl. I’m not that stupid.”

“No, no, it’s fine,” Mio managed to put a spoonful of rice in each bowl before her stomach acted up again, “Oh no!” cried Mio, “I think I’m going to shit myself.”

Thinking quickly, you grabbed both bowls and said, “Squat down and shit in these bowls.”

“Oh, okay,”

She squatted and you held the bowls right below her puckering asshole. Mio whined as a jet of liquefied shit shot out of her asshole. It smelled like a skunk had just sprayed an already decomposing body. Your nose wrinkled and your eyes watered at the nasty smell. Despite the terrible smell, you had a job to do so you swapped out one bowl with the other as soon as it became full in a way that prevented any shit from splashing onto the ground. Strangely, the sound Mio’s shit made when it hit the bowl was not dissimilar to the sound of peeing in a toilet.

Her sour-smelling shit stream suddenly stopped filling both bowls with her rancid diarrhea. Now there was the question of what to do with the bowls. You couldn’t’ve thrown it down the drain as the smell would linger for many days and you couldn’t’ve thrown it down the toilet because there was a high chance the bowl would spill, staining the carpet. Neither of you could think of what to do until you came up with an interesting idea.

“What if we ate it like miso soup?”

“No,” replied Mio, curtly.

“Honey, think about it. You’ve sucked my cock which pee comes out of and you’ve squirted on me which is also pee. A little shit here and there won’t hurt anyone.”

Mio sighed, “It has to be done. There’s no other way to get rid of the bowls filled with my diarrhea.”

The two of you dug in and immediately almost threw up. Mio’s shit, seasoned with salt and pepper, still tasted like shit. It didn’t help that the rice soaked up the poop so it became juicy with shit. But, for some reason, you enjoyed it. You didn’t know why, but you knew that you did and you wanted Mio to eat your shit as well. Both of you made the mistake of eating the rice first which left a sizable amount of diarrhea in the bowl leaving the two of you with one choice: to drink it like a bowl of cereal.

You looked at Mio and she looked at you. Misery was painted on her face while you hid a gleeful smile. The two of you grabbed your respective bowl and drank it at the same time chugging Mio’s shit as fast as possible. Occasionally, you felt chunks of shit touch your lips before being swallowed whole. The ordeal was over. Only a small amount of liquid shit remained in the bowl which was small enough to be washed away and not leave a smell. You looked over at Mio who looked like she was about to cry. Putting a hand on her shoulder, you said, “Don’t worry Mio, it’s over now. We never have to do that again.

The wolf girl shook her head, “More’s coming. Get ready for seconds.”

She passed gas in a way that resembled rolling thunder and squatted once more ready to have you prevent her from shitting on the floor. You held your bowl right below her asshole just like before. However, this time it was more solid and slowly came out of her asshole like a soft-serve ice cream machine. You even moved the bowl around to create a swirl of shit that, once settled, looked like a smoothed-out bowl of chocolate ice cream. Yum. Luckily for Mio, there was only enough shit to fill one wooden bowl.

You placed the bowl of steaming shit on the sink where you took in a huge whiff smelling Mio’s fecal matter. You scooped up a spoonful and ate it. Mio’s delicious warm shit melted in your mouth, tasting not only like shit but also like all the other foods she ate the previous day. There were hints of fish, of fruits, of vegetables, and even of your semen. All the flavors combined to make an absolutely delectable dish. You finished it in no time which worried Mio a little bit, but she was thankful that you cleaned up her mess.

Then as Mio was washing the wooden bowls and spoons, you felt a particularly awful rumbling in your stomach. Mio heard the noise too and looked at you like she saw a ghost. “Mio,” you said, “Get down on your knees.”

A single tear ran down her face, “No, I don’t want to.”

“Mio, you have to. Think of the children.”

She got on her knees, brushed her hair away from her face, and opened wide. After pulling down your pants, you put your asshole against her mouth then let nature do its thing. You pushed out a fat log of shit which Mio nibbled on as it came out of your ass eating it bit by bit. At first, she didn’t make a sound and ate your shit in consigned silence, but then something strange happened. Mio began moaning. She moaned with each bite, each lick reverberating throughout your body. She pulled apart your asscheeks so that she could better scoop up your shit with her tongue. Mio sounded like she loved every second of eating your poop.

“That was fast,” you said, not feeling the need to use the restroom anymore.

Mio replied, “I’m not done yet,” and licked the rim of your asshole and even the cheeks, “There, I had to clean your ass for you.”

“Thanks Mio, I didn’t know you were into assholes so much.”

“I’m a slut for shit.”

“I bet you are,” you turned around and looked down at Mio whose mouth looked like a fat kid’s after eating a chocolate bar, “You have some stuff…”

“I know,” pushing her tits together, Mio licked all the shit that was around her mouth until it was spotless and moaned the entire time, “I’m so horny.”

“So am I.”

You grabbed Mio by the hand and pulled her up on her feet. The two of you made your way to the bedroom where you were both planning on having poop-involved coitus when you passed by the closet. Mio stopped; her ears perked up straining to hear something. “Do you hear that?” whispered Mio, “Someone’s breathing in the closet. It sounds like they’re asleep”

You opened the door then closed it immediately after seeing a telltale green hat. You whispered to Mio, “I knew it, I knew it was a gnome that ate our food. Thank God it’s only a green hat if it was a red hat…”

“What should we do?” asked a worried Mio.

“First, we calm down. I won’t let that devil spawn hurt you.”

Mio nodded.

“Then, you put salt around the door while I go get a pitchfork from the toolshed.”

“Is that all?”

“Yes, and remember to be quiet. We’re lucky it’s still sleeping.”

Pitchfork in hand, you came back to Mio who had just finished salting the door. She didn’t spare a single grain of salt. There was so much salt that you could’ve left the gnome in there as it was trapped, but gnomes are wily creatures known for their cunning and deception. You sprinkled some Holy Water on the three rusted tines of the pitchfork. Mio held the door handle waiting for your sign.

“On a count of three, open it. One. Two. Three,” Mio swung the closet door open, “Die Hell spawn!” You drove the pitchfork into the sleeping gnome which woke up just in time to see its own demise. The gnome’s body ignited from the Holy Water into a brilliant blue flame that gave off no heat as it was a physical manifestation of its soul being sent back to Hell. You carried the burning corpse across the living room and dumped it in the fireplace where it turned to ash.

Mio hugged you from behind, wrapping her arms around your stomach and nuzzling her face on your back. You leaned the pitchfork against the wall then turned around to hug Mio back who stuffed her face into your chest. You stroked her hair telling her that it’d all be okay now and slowly moved your hand down to the strap that held her apron in place. In one quick motion, you undid and the apron slacked only remaining on Mio because of how close she held you. She looked up at you with her glowing lustful eyes, purring, “You wanna do it now? Okay, after all you’ve been really good today.”

She stepped back letting her apron fall to the ground. You finally got to see her pale saggy boobs that were tipped with brown nipples. Looking further down, you saw her flat stomach and her kissable belly button, but most importantly you saw her pussy which was slightly obscured by a dense black bush. Every part of her body was amazing; it left you speechless. All you could say was, “Mamma Mio.”
