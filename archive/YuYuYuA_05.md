[Sonoko-sama's dream]

Sonoko's dream - late night edition

Son: Morning y'all!

Yuu: Welcome, our pure customer.

Son: Oh? Yuuyu?

Yuu: This is the Hero Bar. We specialise on female customers, allow us to take care of you.

Son: Hoho... Hohoho...

Kar: Miss, who would you like to order?

Son: Well that's an interesting development, time to enjoy it! One Wasshi, please!

Tou: Hello, Sonocchi.

Son: Hey, Wasshi, what's the matter, opening a shop like this?

Tou: I wanted us Heroes to be able to help girls. I thought it'd be easy for them to talk about their worries in a place like this.

Son: What a wonderful goal. The Shinju-sama must be overjoyed too.

Tou: Sonocchi, is there anything weighing on your mind?

Son: I'm having issues coming up with material for a new story, I guess.

Tou: Ah, one of those creativity crises perhaps?

Son: I don't really want to call it a slump, though.

Tou: Hmm, how troublesome.

Tou: How can we cure that condition?

Son: Let's see. Maybe if I get to experience something exciting, an idea will just whoosh and come out just like that.

Tou: In that case, Sonocchi. Do you want to experience something exciting... with me?

Son: W-Wah-Wasshi!?

Tou: It's alright. Just close your eyes...

Son: That's the dream I saw. That was a surprise.

Tou: Hey! Why am I so vulgar in your dream?

Son: You were wonderful that way too, Wasshi!

Tou: Don't try to change the subject!

Fuu: A place where you can chat with the Heroes, huh.

Fuu: If there was a place like that, I'd be a regular there and hog Itsuki all to myself.

Tou: But you already spend all of your time together... Such deep love.

Fuu: I'd order enough Dom Perignon udon to make Itsuki the top earner... I'm quite devoted if I do say so myself.

Kar: Exactly what is Dom Perignon udon supposed to be...

Kar: But jeez, even Sonoko's dreams are something else.

Tou: Sonocchi's been this way since elementary school...

Son: You know, there are times when I always see dreams.

Tou: So that's why you regularly bring up your dreams, huh.

Tou: What if you have Miko qualities too, Sonocchi?

Son: Oh? I had a hidden talent like that? Sounds nice.

Son: Beep beep beep. I just had a vision! Wasshi's going to do a comedy skit!

Tou: Then let me do a somewhat dangerous national defence gag.

Fuu: Stop! What Tougou calls "dangerous" means "super dangerous" to anybody else!

Fuu: ...Phew, being a tsukkomi is rough. Karin, don't slack off.

Kar: Ah, my bad. I was just thinking I haven't seen any dreams lately.

Its: They say you'll get to see the dream you want if you write down the contents on a piece of paper and put it under your pillow before sleep.

Kar: Huh. Well, not that I'm going to bother testing that.

Fuu: Or so she says. I bet you want to see a dream involving an all-you-can-eat dried sardine buffet.

Kar: I'm already eating as many as I want in reality.

Kar: What about you, Fuu? I bet you want to see a dream where you can eat as much udon as you want.

Fuu: I'm also eating as much udon as I want in reality already.

Kar: ...Take care of your health, okay? Udon is tasty though.

Fuu: And I see dreams of myself eating udon too.

Kar: So you've already been seeing those dreams!

Fuu: Kamaage udon for dinner, and niku bukkake udon in my sleep. Different varieties, so I don't get tired of them.

Yuu: Such an endless love for udon.

Kar: Itsuki, have you seen any dreams lately?

Its: I haven't, but last night I got a calf cramp while sleeping... It hurt.

Its: It felt prickly... I thought it was just my imagination, but then the pain washed over and made me realise I wasn't dreaming after all.

Yuu: Ah, that's painful. Here, here.

Its: I almost called Onee-chan to me...

Tou: Well, with our party at full swing, it's time for a national defence ga...

Fuu: Quit it!

Son: I'm probably going to see a dream tonight too.

Kar: Write the contents of the dream and put the paper under the pillow, was it?

Kar: ...I-I'm just trying it out.

Kar: ...Just trying.

Sonoko's dream - fierce fight edition.

Son: Wasshi, Sancho-san powered up!

Tou: Huh? What's that all of a sudden!?

Son: He told me he's been a fairy all along...

Tou: That sounds weirdly plausible...

Tou: So, what exactly was the power-up?

Son: I can take out weapons that are hidden in his mouth.

Son: Sancho, number four! Justice! Hero Spear! ...Kind of like that.

Tou: Sounds like he's a pretty dangerous being... No offence, Sonocchi.

Tou: But I must verify if Sancho's virtuous or not!

Son: Eh? W-Wasshi?

Tou: National defence transformation!

Yuu: I'll help too! Hero! Guts! Best match!

Son: Don't do it! Wasshi, Yuuyu, don't fight Sancho!

Its: I'll join this battle too! Karin-san! Yuuna-san! I'll borrow your heroic powers!

Yuu: Seiya! Voltech Hero Kick!

Son: Aw man, this is a disaster.

Son: And that's the dream I saw.

Tou: You see some unbelievable stuff.

Kar: And I was wondering why I didn't see it. Guess it went to you.

Son: Huh, what did?

Kar: Ah, uh. *cough* N-Nothing.

Kar: Hm!? Was there someone who didn't appear in your dream but appeared in mine, Nibosshi?

Kar: I-I'm telling you it's nothing! End of discussion! Stop digging so deep!

Yuu: Karin-chan, your face is all red. Are you okay?

Kar: Y-Yeah. I'm just fine.

Fuu: Do you wake up tired after seeing dreams this crazy?

Son: Don't think so. But that time I dreamt I was banned from eating udon really had me scared... I woke up drenched in sweat.

Fuu: That's straight up a nightmare... I'm getting goosebumps.

Tou: Speaking of bad dreams, I've seen one myself... I dreamt that me and Yuuna-chan had a fight.

Yuu: Eh? Me and you?

Tou: Yeah...

Yuu: Tougou-san, I don't know you anymore!

Tou: Ah!? Huff, huff, huff... Blergh...

Tou: T-Thank goodness... It was just... just a dream.

Tou: That's how it went.

Fuu: That's one hell of a reaction.

Yuu: Tougou-san, I'm sorry for my dream self.

Tou: Don't worry,  Yuuna-chan. I should be apologising.

Yuu: And so, we made up!

Fuu: You weren't having a fight in the first place.

Yuu: Since we talked about them yesterday, I looked up something on dreams...

Yuu: So maybe... Maybe Sono-chan's dream was a prophetic dream?

Son: Eeh!? I don't want to fight with you, Yuuyu!

Yuu: I can't fight you either, Sono-chan!

Kar: Sancho isn't a fairy in the first place, so calm down.

Yuu: When did you become friends with Sancho, Sono-chan?

Son: One morning I found him lying by my pillow.

Kar: ...It's really not a fairy, right? I'm suddenly less confident.

Son: Would be interesting if it was.

Kar: You have Karasutengu already. I don't know what it's thinking, but it moves around a lot.

Son: Karasutengu, or rather, Sebastian is a pretty free spirit.

Kar: Sure is. I wonder who it took that from.

Yuu: All things must pass.

Tou: Yuuna-chan, that was spot on.

Fuu: All things must pass.

Tou: You've gotten a little better at that.

Fuu: I don't accept this.

Son: By the way, Nibosshi, tell us something interesting.

Kar: Could you not make crazy swerves like that?

Tou: Sonocchi can be whimsical.

Fuu: Just like a princess, how lovely. Karin, so how about that something interesting.

Kar: Nothing I say will be interesting with this mood.

Kar: But I'll get through it with my perfect hidden powers!

Fuu: Impressive, she just inspired herself.

Yuu: That's our Karin-chan, the Perfect Braveman!

Kar: This one time, it was just me and Itsuki in the clubroom, and she was sleeping, stretched out on the table. Then, still asleep, she asked me:

Its: *yawn* Onee-chan, what time is it?

Kar: I wanted to let her sleep a bit longer, so I pretended to be Fuu and said this: 

Kar: It's still early enough to sleep, so go back to sleep.

Its: Wake me up, okay... Zzz...

Kar: And then she went back to sleep, but suddenly started screaming this in her sleep:

Its: Hurray, it got bigger! It got bigger! I did it! Inubouzaki Itsuki did it!

Kar: Then she suddenly woke up and started looking around.

Its: Aww, it was just a dream... Zzz...

Kar: And then she went back to sleep again! How's that? Interesting?

Its: Y-You're just exposing me!

Its: But wait, did I actually...

Kar: So you really don't remember that.

Its: I remember my dreams sometimes, but I can't clearly remember all of them.

Fuu: Nogi's a pro at that.

Son: I get that often.

Tou: What exactly got bigger in Itsuki-chan's dream, I wonder?

Its: A-Ahaha... The aspirations hidden inside my chest, or something...

Son: Or maybe it was a dream where your chest itself got bigger?

Its: Rgh... I think it might've been that.

Yuu: That's a prophetic dream. You'll start growing quickly from now on, Itsuki-chan!

Its: But in reality, my waist's the part in danger...

Kar: Fuu, it's because you keep feeding her so much.

Its: She's the kind of person who'll nod in agreement when I say I'm going on a diet, then bring out udon.

Its: But that's fine. If I ever have something to tell her, I can just make food myself.

Fuu: That's my sister. You understand what I'm trying to say.

Son: I wonder what kind of dream I'm going to see tonight...

Yuu: Since yesterday you saw a dream of us fighting, I'll pray for you to see a dream where we get along tonight. Nice dream, nice dream... 

Tou: Ah, Yuuna-chan, your kindness is permeating me...

Sonoko's dream - future edition.

Taisha priestess (Aki): Once the perfect Hero is mass-produced, the Vertexes will hardly be a threat...

Aki: Thus I propose to mass-produce Miyoshi Karin.

Aki: And so, our project which began from that has finally been completed. Allow me to present the results.

Aki: Mass-produced Miyoshi Karin.

MP Karin: I can work as long as I have dried sardines!

Aki: Mass-produced Miyoshi Karin - sniper type.

Sniper type: I can shoot right through my target as long as I have dried sardines!

Aki: Mass-produced Miyoshi Karin for cold environments.

Karin Cold Districts: I can work as long as I have warm dried sardines!

Aki: Mass-produced Miyoshi Karin - trainer type.

Karin Trainer: Let's work up a good sweat and eat dried sardines!

Aki: Akechi Mitsuhide Karin.

Akechi Mitsuhide Karin: Nishishi. The enemy waits for us at Honnoji-dines! All troops, advance-dines!

Aki: Metal Karin, who gives a lot of EXP.

Metal Karin: Dried sardines. Eat.

Son: Wah, it's a Nibosshi paradise!

Son: And that's the dream I saw.

Kar: Do you see me as a creature that does nothing but eat dried sardines?

Yuu: A whole lot of Karin-chans must have been a spectacle to see.

Kar: What is metal Karin even supposed to be?

Son: She was moving around really fast.

Kar: And all Mitsuhide Karin did was have a "sardines" verbal tic!

Fuu: What about a space Karin?

Kar: That doesn't exist!

Son: There was one. She was eating space sardines.

Kar: Even in space nothing changes?

Kar: Haah, haah. I'm tired of playing tsukkomi.

Fuu: Mhm, another peaceful day. Yuuna and Tougou, how about you?

Yuu: Tougou-san appeared in my dream, and made some really impressive sweets.

Tou: I'll make that dream come true, Yuuna-chan.

Fuu: All's well, business as usual.

Son: I think I'm going to see a dream tonight too. I wonder what it will be.

Son: ...Huh? Is that...

Gin: Yo, Sonoko!

Son: Ah, Mino-san. Sancho says "Sup" too.

Gin: Sup, Sancho? Rockin' as usual, huh.

Tou: All three of us are together.

Gin: Yeah, the usual three.

Gin: What are we doing in the club today?

Tou: Practicing for the play, no? Yuuna-chan's really excited about it.

Gin: Ahaha, Yuuna did look sleepy in class.

Son: Sleeping in class is bad!

Gin: Sonoko, you don't get to say that.

Son: Tehehe, pardon.

Son: After that, we'll be raising Ittsun.

Gin: Itsuki's growing up quickly, so it's worth raising her.

Gin: Fuu-senpai's going to leave soon, but with Itsuki around the Hero Club should be safe.

Tou: Gin, why don't you run to be the next president?

Gin: No way, I'm not cut out for that.

Gin: Karin's probably going to be the president.

Tou: You weaseled your way out of being our captain in elementary too.

Gin: Right person for the right job, Mimori-kun. I'll compensate for that with work.

Son: ...Huh?

Gin: What's wrong, Sonoko?

Son: (How can Mino-san be at the Sanshuu Middle school? That's weird, I mean...)

Son: (Ah, I see... This is a dream, isn't it...)

Gin: You noticed too soon. Sonoko, you're way too sharp for your own good.

Gin: You're about to wake up. And I can't go with you.

Son: Mino-san...

Gin: No biggie. Somewhere, somewhen, we'll meet again.

Son: ...Yeah.

Gin: See ya.

Tou: See you...

Son: And that's the dream I saw.

Son: It was fun at first, but it was a very sad dream...

Tou: ...I saw it too, Sonocchi.

Son: Huh. Wasshi, you too?!

Tou: Could such a coincidence really happen...

Son: It probably could. A mystery of the Divine Era.

Tou: Somewhere, somewhen, we'll meet again...

Son: Maybe in our next lives.

Tou: That's a long wait. But I'd be happy with that.

Son: Talk about best friends forever!

Tou: ...Yeah.

Tou: Gin, watch over us.

Son: We're getting by, somehow.

A gentle wind blew...
