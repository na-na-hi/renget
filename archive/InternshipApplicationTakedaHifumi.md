**Essay Questions:**

- *Tell us about a moment in your life when your passion for heroism or helping others was ignited. How did it make you feel, and what steps have you taken to pursue this calling? (Max. 300 words)*
 
The Nishinomiya Incident. Watching Endeavour defeat multiple villains, save thousands of people, and take the number one spot is probably the biggest single moment I can point to if I have to. But I believe it wasn't really just a spur of the moment that ignited the passion. It was a gradual build up.

I mean, I always thought that helping others is cool, and really, in most professions you do it in some way or another. So, in essence, I always believed that I wanted to help others, and a man should be passionate about what he does, so that flame was always there.

But deciding that it's the path of the pro hero I want to follow? That came on later. I made that decision in middle school, so you might say it was kinda late, but I think it was more of a realization that this was the path for me at that point. That this is what I'm most suitable for and the way I can help the most people.

So, I realized, what I want to become: the number one hero. Even greater than Endeavour. The one that will help others and inspire them so that they will do the same (though not necessarily as pro heroes). Push the level of what being a hero means a bit further. And one day, maybe, hopefully, a new young hero will come to take the number one spot from me. And maybe he will have been inspired to go that road by me, just like I was inspired by Endeavour. And this way, step by step, we will have made the world a better place,

So yeah, Nishinomiya Incident was probably the biggest single moment for my dream.

- *Impakt is known for his unwavering belief in the power of passion. How do you define passion, and how do you believe it can enhance your abilities as a hero? (Max. 250 words)*

I prefer the word "dream", but it's basically the same. It's what gives life direction. Something you can put all your effort into. An obsession that will occupy your whole being.

I think it's extremely important to have one. For some, it's not easy to find it, but it's the first step. Then there is finding the way to realize it. Then finally is committing to that way.

But it's that passion that will guide you and support you along the way. Give you the motivation and discipline needed to achieve your dream.

Sometimes following your dream isn't easy. There is a part of me that wants to sleep in instead of going for a run. To throw the books out the window instead of studying for an exam. To take the easy road. But I beat it every single time. And I believe it's because of this passion. 

My dream is becoming the number one hero. Having that end goal in mind, I've set out the path to achieve it. Training hard, studying hard, joining a school with an elite hero program. All important steps of my journey. Now, the next step I want to make is joining this internship.
 

- *Describe a challenging situation where you demonstrated determination and resilience. How did you overcome the obstacles, and what did you learn from the experience? (Max. 200 words)*
 
The final part of the Licence Exam pushed me to my limits. I was wounded, tired and facing Magnum Shrimp, whom I could not beat head on. However, I made a promise to someone important to me, that I will complete the exam.

I managed to stay calm and formulated a plan, that, if risky, gave me a good chance of success. The plan required me to tank a punch from Magnum, so it definitely required determination and resilience.

I had a key, all that was left was to activate the scanner and go through the doors. Magnum was standing in front my target. I teleported to the scanner and used it. That's when the blow from Magnum came. I knew I wouldn't be able to dodge it. So, I remembered watching Impakt fighting Drekus. I absorbed the momentum from the punch. Before the Blink, I set myself in such a position that on return, even when I lost consciousness, I got pushed right through the exit.

I completed the exam and learned that a sacrifice is necessary in some situations, but also that I should train even harder so that such situations will be fewer in the future.

- *At Kraftwerk Hero Agency, we value teamwork and collaboration. Describe a time when you worked with others to achieve a common goal. What role did you play in the team, and how did your contributions impact the final outcome? (Max. 250 words)*

Shiketsu encourages teamwork, both in school and outside of it. Multiple lessons require us to consider how we'd work with others, and many of them let us practice it. The importance of this chance to learn and grow alongside future heroes cannot be overstated, especially with how my Quirk works.

One of the first exercises that put as to the test as groups was during the first class with Majestic-sensei. We were split into 4v4, one side playing the villains, the other heroes. Villains went on site first to find and grab target items. Heroes entered after delay to try to prevent items from being stolen and capture the villains.

I was in the hero group, and spoiling the ending, "you either win or you learn", we learned a lot that day. 

My role that day was threefold. First: getting my teammates on the site quickly. Second: taking down one of the "villains" while supporting my teammate in his fight. Third: trying to salvage the situation when things looked bleak.

I helped our reaction time, took down and captured one of the opponents, and helped slow down others. Yet, I failed to support my allies at times, miscommunicated, stretched too thin and we lost.

At the end of the day, we prevented the opponents' total victory and I think we've done some things right, but there was still a lot we had to improve (and I believe we did a lot of work on that since then).

- *In the face of adversity, heroes must make tough decisions. How do you handle moral dilemmas, and how do you ensure your choices align with your values and the well-being of others? (Max. 200 words)*

In Hero work, the tough moral decisions usually need to be taken in a split second, often in a difficult environment. There is not much space to deliberate on them on the spot. As such, I believe it's how we prepare for such situations beforehand that's truly important. Getting the knowledge about how to behave in common situations and developing the moral core that will guide us in those unclear ones. Thanks to that, one can more quickly and accurately decide when the time comes. Ethics version of "the more you sweat in training, the less you bleed in combat".

Besides the standard moral guidance that everyone gets growing up, Shiketsu's curriculum puts big importance on furthering that education in us. Ethics class, law class, hero work classes. All of those are aimed at giving us the theoretical base we will need in the future.

But theory is nothing without practice, and that's partially what I seek in this internship. Seeing in person how those kinds of decisions are taken in the field and having a chance to take them myself will be important to my development, and will positively impact my ability to solve such dilemmas in the future.

- *Kraftwerk Hero Agency prides itself in the constant growth and improvement of our heroes. What are your short-term and long-term goals as a hero, and how do you plan to achieve them? (Max. 300 words)*

I've already discussed my long-term goal: becoming the number one and inspiring others to become their best selves. That's pretty much as long-term as it can be. Naturally, there are a lot of intermediate steps I must take before I get to that, and even those might qualify as long-term, so I'll just start with short-term goals and go from there.

I believe the next step I need to take is the internship. It's an important step in the development of a young hero. A chance to train under someone other than our teachers and friends, gain practical experience, make contacts in the industry and start building our brand. I believe Kraftwerk is the best spot for that for me. 

After that, things may change depending on the circumstances (adjusting to the situation is important), but I do have a rough idea in mind. After graduating and  going pro, I believe I'll join another agency as a sidekick. Get more experience at that next level of responsibility and earn funds I'll need to go to the next step. Once I'm ready, I'll open my own agency, either solo or in partnership with people close to me. Then it will be the long process of growing the agency as I try to climb the ranks. Finally, an even longer one with building my legacy as the number one.

There are also goals that will take place all along the way: self-improvement, working on the public image and so on. Care and effort must be put into those, both straight-up, and improving the methods one uses.

But there is one goal even more important than those. The ultimate goal all others are in service of: to save others and help make the world a better place.
