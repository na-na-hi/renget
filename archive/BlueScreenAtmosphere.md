###Bluescreen after updating Atmosphere
***
If you updated atmosphere recently, but you are getting a blue screen on bootup, please ensure that you download the latest [fusee.bin](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere/releases/latest/download/fusee.bin) payload and place it in your `/bootloader/payloads/` folder on your SD card or update your payload injector with the latest [fusee.bin](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere/releases/latest/download/fusee.bin) payload.
