A wealthy heiress of a well-to-do family, complete with a rather powerful quirk. That she had no desire to become a hero was a surprise to many. In her own words, she had no desire to be outstanding. Merely being another face in the crowd was fine. Regretfully, her pleasant, comfy life of luxury met an end one night. A strange man with an overwhelming aura and a short woman with a nasty scowl appeared before her. She activated her quirk out of fear and was quickly beaten into submission.

As the man reached forward with killing intent, the woman snapped at him, asserting utmost dominance. Apparently, the form of a Fenrir made for an excellent pet... Which was utterly humiliating, but the life or death situation triggered her Quirk Compulsion: Pack Mentality. This part of her quirk is something inherited from her family rather than anything inherent to being a Fenrir. It ensures loyalty to the thing viewed as 'the strongest'. Prior to this incident, that was her father. She believed that he was the greatest and wanted nothing more than to follow his lead... And now, that had switched to the short woman before her. As a being that could command such a dreadful and overwhelming monster, she was without a doubt the most powerful, beautiful, and majestic being on this planet... In other words she's become a sycophant that worships the ground Mio walks on.

Due to seeing the hostility Mio displays towards Sandatsu, she's taken to viewing Sandatsu as her nemesis and actively guards Mio against him, much to Mio's smug entertainment. Sadly, she isn't even close to being his match in a fight.
