**Personality / Info**
Vulgar mouthed and hot-headed, Lyra's always been the type to walk to the beat of her own drum, not caring about other people's opinions if they don't align with her own. She's got a strong sense of her justice, and isn't the type to waver in her beliefs. Because of her upbringing alongside pirates and her adoptive father, she's far from your typical halfling - but the traits she does have, such as her obsession with tinkering and her kender weakness, have only been amplified thanks to the company she's been raised alongside. She's got a surprising amount of knowledge and affinity for Oni culture, but unfortunately, had never been able to handle her drink.
In battle, Lyra wields an oversized hammer for close-ranged attacks and a cannon for long-ranged attacks, both of which have been crafted and modified by herself. With her high skill in Alchemy, Artistry, Cooking and especially Smithing, she's a reliable crafter - as long as you can get her to agree to do work for you, which is a rather difficult task. Ironically, despite being a Halfling by Blood, she's mediocre when it comes to Music.

**Backstory**
Lyra's blood origins are unknown and unimportant, but she was left at a Ballad Orphanage's doors where she immediately found solace in the company of the other orphans, becoming a sort of protective big sister figure to them all. One day, an infamous Pirate - Katsumori Daijuu - had entered, searching for a young boy to adopt in order to one day inherit his power. Instead, he was surprised to find a small halfling girl protectively standing in front of her cowering 'siblings', and was taken to the confident attitude of the little girl.
He'd intended on his now beloved daughter to become a noblewoman, his little princess - only to be surprised when she'd more taken to his Oni culture and Pirate ways. Regardless of how many beautiful dresses he'd gotten her or how many teachers he'd ~~kidnap~~ convince to come to the ship to teach her the ways of refinement, she always found herself happier roughhousing, as well as displaying her growing talent with inventions. While he loved his daughter dearly and doted upon her intensely, he couldn't help but desire her to find a wonderful partner to one day continue the bloodline.
By now, disinterested by the prospect of noble life, Lyra immediately fled the nest in order to pursue her own dreams of becoming the most 'kickass inventor fuckin' ever' much to her father's chagrin, without any of his treasures and nothing but her own strong, unbreakable will.
She keeps her connection to the infamous Pirate Lord a secret.
