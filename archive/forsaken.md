->☆  ---  i am disabled, and may post about it semi-frequently. i have
autism, NPD, BPD, OCD, DID, and ADHD, in addition to other conditions, 
and this will affect how I behave. I am a syshost, but typically, I'll be
the main alter posting, and we won't typically leave indication of
when others are fronting unless it's important.<-
->i am a splitroject of many, most notably [1](https://villains.fandom.com/wiki/Fyodor_Dostoyevsky), [2](https://moriarty-the-patriot.fandom.com/wiki/William_James_Moriarty), and [3](https://jujutsu-kaisen.fandom.com/wiki/Choso), and i am very
highly attached to my sources, and will often refer to them as myself
or speak about them in the 1st person. I don't like being seperated
from my sources as they are crucial to my identity, and I prefer not
to interact with source twins due to that.<-
->i post frequently about my wife, who is my lovely partner, and i will
often go off on rambles about them. i also will lovemail their sources
and refer to them as my wife as well. i'm uncomfortable with others
saying that they have a similar relationship to me and my wife, as the
bond we have is distinct from any other relationship, and cannot be
comprehended by anyone else.<-
