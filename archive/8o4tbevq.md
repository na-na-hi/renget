It was about three days ago when Kronii contacted Fauna about hanging out at a nearby ramen shop. She initially agreed to the meeting, because why wouldn't she? The warden of time is her dear friend, and what's more is that she'd get some good food out of this arrangement as well.

"*that sounds awesome! I'd love to hang out and chill with you*"

 Fauna's fingers tapped on her phone excitedly. However, Kronii's response wasn't quite what she was expecting.

"*Yeah me too. But uh... there's one more thing I need to mention. Apparently the place is having this contest or something? There's this challenge where if you can eat like 10 bowls of ramen, the whole meal is free. I thought it sounded like a fun little game or whatever we could do.*"

Although Kronii wasn't necessarily lying, unbeknownst to Fauna her plans mainly concerned what happened *after* the ramen binge. Her long, slender fingers tapped on the screen of her phone once more.

 "*So, you still wanna do it?*" 

Fauna looked at the phone incredulously. While she was used to her friend making these spur-of-the-moment requests to do or see something together, she had never been asked to participate in an eating contest before. Still, she held a lot of admiration for the warden of time. And who knows? Maybe this could be fun!

"*wow I've never done one of those before. but it could be a pretty interesting experience!*"

She texted with a bright smile on her face. Fauna had no idea just how true that last sentence would end up being.

**Three days later...**

"Ugh... why did I agree to this... I feel like I'm gonna explode, Kronii!"

Fauna sat in the small restaurant and pouted as she rubbed her rather distended, and bloated belly. Ten bowls of vegan ramen were going to war in her bowels, and she could easily feel her stomach almost inflating like a balloon from the sheer amount of gas forming. "This was way too much food for my poor tummy..." she said, rubbing her food baby.

"Mmm, I don't know about that. You crushed those bowls like a champ, Fauna. Then again, so did I." 

Kronii's face was sweating bullets as she looked down at her own belly, which was similarly filled to the max with the byproducts of her gluttonous act. She had decided to go for the spiciest ramen available. A meal filled with a whole heaping of chili paste, spiced pork, and fried egg for good measure. The result of eating ten bowls of this meant her ass was *deadly* to say the least. The warden of time was in considerable pain from the veritable caldera that was forming in her bowels, though she was too excited to really care.

"It's a good thing we both won, ya know?" Kronii's face was plastered with a shit-eating grin as she turned to look Fauna right in the eyes. "Because now the real contest is gonna begin. I've been thinking about this for a while, actually. I can't wait to see how you fare against my perfect ass."

Fauna was dumbfounded at this new information. Was Kronii challenging her... to a fart contest? She turned to face Kronii, her cheeks flushed a scarlet red out of sheer embarrassment.

"Wha... what the heck, Kronii?! You want us to see who can fart more or something? That's... that's so gross! I could never do that!" Fauna said, almost shouting.
 
"Especially not... you know... in public." Her voice dropped to a hushed whisper and she began to clutch her stomach again.

Meanwhile Kronii was loving this. She had been itching to see Fauna loosen up and learn to have fun. Yeah, it was gross, but who cares? It was worth it to see a side of Fauna that was normally hidden. "Oh come on. It's just a fun little thing between friends, you know? Are you really gonna be this dainty that you won't even pass gas in front of me?"

Kronii scoffed, crossing her arms under her massive tits that were now slick with sweat. "I think you're just scared. Not that I can blame you too much, you're going up against someone who's *literally perfect* after all." She was really trying hard to goad her friend now.

"I am NOT scared! I'm just-" Fauna felt the pressure suddenly spike in her guts, causing her to wince. It was obvious to both women that Fauna was on borrowed time, and any second now her ass would let loose.

Meanwhile Kronii wasn't faring any better. Her stomach was producing a cacophony of gurgles and she was sweating so much, it was dripping down her cavernous cleavage like a leaky faucet. The seat her fat ass was planted on was practically soaked by her swampy crack at this point.

"Look, Fauna. Both of us are pretty damn bloated and we're gonna fart like crazy soon. So you might as well go along with my contest. If you're gonna be gross, let's at least have some fun with it, eh?" Kronii said through gritted teeth. Somehow, despite all the pain, a faint smile was still visible on her face.

"Hrnngh... F-Fine! I'll do the dumb contest! But you can't complain, okay? You asked for this!" Fauna huffed in frustration before standing up and turning around, lifting the short skirt that barely covered her meaty cheeks anyway. The nature goddess aimed her ample ass right at Kronii, throwing her off guard.

Kronii's eyes filled with a sense of dread akin to that of being held at gunpoint when she saw this. "W-Whoa! Wait a sec! You don't have to point it directly at me!" She threw her hands up in a futile attempt to delay the inevitable, but it was too late.

In an instant, it seemed like a bomb had gone off in the small establishment. Tables and chairs were sent flying, people were screaming, and the sound of Fauna's ass cannon firing a salvo of torrid braps was nearly deafening. A thick, heavy miasma quickly filled the small building, the choking aroma of an entire mountain of compost being set ablaze would have been enough to make even the most iron-stomached of individuals lose their lunch with a single whiff. The sheer force of the blast managed to shred her panties like paper, and even blow the literal roof off of the building.

"Ahh... it felt good to release a little pressure like that. But my tummy still really hurts..." sighed Fauna in her usual melodic tone. However, she soon noticed the carnage her ass had wrought, and started blushing profusely. "W-What the heck!? Did I do... that? But it was just a little toot! Oh no... that's like the third time this week!" She covered her face in embarrassment, even as her belly rumbled with more gas that was surely on its way.

"Don't worry about it, Fauna." Kronii said with her nose pinched, lightly wafting the polluted air. "I can turn back time to fix this mess. You know, just like all the other times your big butt has caused problems? All this destruction can be undone, so uh... we can really just let loose for now. But I have to hand it to you. That 'little toot' of yours was pretty damn impressive. But I think I can do better, actually." Grinning, the warden of time lifted one of her meaty legs and relaxed her greasy asshole before her friend could even respond.

Her huge ass jiggled and clapped fiercely as it blasted out an enormous, spicy fart that went on for over twenty seconds. The surrounding area was filled with the sound, but more devastatingly the toxic stench of Kronii's bubbly ass blast. Her brap was so hot and rancid that it literally began melting the remains of the ramen shop into slag. A heavy, visible orange-ish fog descended upon the street corner, making any unfortunate passersby vomit instantly and collapse into a heap upon breathing in the foul concoction of rotten eggs, meat, and sewage.

Finally, the gale force winds petered out, leaving Kronii lathered in sweat and panting. "Holy shit... now THAT'S what I call a fart." she giggled rather cutely, contrasting heavily with the foul act she was so enthralled in. "Ah, damn. That one smells kinda bad, eh?" Kronii remarked playfully as she wafted the air.

Meanwhile, Fauna seemed unusually unbothered by her opponent's blast. Sure, it was disgusting... but it wasn't as rancid as one of her 'bad' farts. She coughed a bit and pinched her nose, but then felt a somewhat malicious grin creep up on her face. She was somewhat eager to blow Kronii away now. If for no other reason than to get revenge for dragging her into this stupid contest.

"You know what? Fine. I'll play this game of yours. And I'm gonna win too." Fauna said smugly, putting a hand over her gurgling belly. "Oh, really?" Kronii replied. "I don't know where all this confidence came from, but I like it. Just so you know, I'm nowhere *near* done."

It was Fauna's ass the responded instead of her voice, and it had a hell of a lot to say. The obnoxiously loud fart roared out of the kirin's backside with terrifying force, sending cars flying and causing the very earth to vibrate. She unconsciously had her booty pointed towards a nearby two-story building, and it was blown away and reduced to its foundations almost immediately. Fauna's tongue hung lazily out of her mouth from the sheer pleasure of releasing such a behemoth of a brap, not even caring that she was saturating entire sections of the city in deadly ass stink.

Letting out an almost sexual moan, Fauna wiped the sweat forming on her brow and giggled. "Aaaah~ I can't remember when I last felt relief like that! Ew... it's getting kinda stinky around here, hehe. So! I think I totally won this contest right? That one was super huge!" she declared, folding her arms and smirking at her rival.

"Uh... wow. Okay Fauna, credit where credit's due I gotta hand that one to you." Kronii snickered and looked on at the carnage Fauna's flatulence wrought upon the city. "But ya know... you shouldn't count me out just yet."

Kronii bit her lip and moaned slightly as her asshole expanded to accommodate the sheer amount of gas being forced out of it. The time warden's farts were nothing short of toxic, withering and killing and plants they came into contact with. Their corrosiveness was such that even street lamps and cars and other metallic objects started to melt as if they were being eaten away by acid. The area slowly began to look like an irradiated wasteland, complete with an ominous-looking orange sky. And yet still Kronii kept on ripping ass.

"Okay, okay, Kronii! You can stop now! It's getting hard to breathe!" protested Fauna with a hand over her mouth, in some futile attempt to prevent the poison from entering her lungs.

After about forty full seconds of non-stop ass blasts, it seemed like the worst of it was over. Kronii continued standing there with crossed eyes for a few seconds, her brain still buzzing from pleasure and relief. Then she came back to her senses. "So uh... yeah! What do you think about that, Fauna? You wanna admit that I won this little contest?"

Fauna was seriously about to admit defeat here. That last fart of Kronii's was absolutely wretched, even for her. She felt utterly outclassed here, like trying to fight a high caliber rifle with a water pistol.

"Y-Yeah... I think we sho-" the nature goddess's voice suddenly came to a halt as both she and her friend saw a familiar silhouette emerge from the fog their asses had created.

"Hey guys! Looks like you've been having a real uh... blast over here. You should have invited me if I knew this is the kinda fun you were gonna have!" the owl girl pouted slightly and put her hands on her hips.

Naturally, the two girls were shocked to suddenly see their genmate come out of nowhere like this.

"Mumei? What are you doing here? W-We were just... um..." Fauna seemed somewhat flustered to have to explain this situation to her friend.

"Having a fart contest? Yeah, I know. That's what I'm saying. You guys really should have invited me. My stomach's been kinda... iffy recently." commented Mumei as she rubbed her belly. But before anyone could respond, the owl's belly roared to life with an almost alien growl. The sound shocked Kronii and Fauna, and filled them with a sense of foreboding.

It was as if some primal fear began to set in Kronii's mind, and she spoke in a slightly shaking voice. "W-What the hell was that? Did that come from... you, Mumei?" she watched with trepidation as Mumei walked a few feet to the side, and stuck her big ass out, aiming it towards the skyscrapers in the distance.

Grinning, Mumei looked Kronii right in the eyes and spoke in a matter-of-fact tone. "Yup. I think this one's gonna be big. So you two should prepare yourselves."  With that, she relaxed her asshole and let loose.

The truth is that nobody could have prepared for what came next. If Fauna's and Kronii's farts were bombs, Mumei's was a veritable *nuke*. It was incredibly loud, deafeningly so. So loud that the two unfortunate witnesses to this explosion had to make a choice to cover their ears or plug their noses. Initially, they chose the former. But they would soon regret that decision. The fart was so powerful it instantly blew away any and all buildings in a fifty mile radius, and even broke a hole straight through the clouds. It could literally be seen from space.

Then the smell hit. Both Fauna and Kronii immediately fell to the ground retching and dry heaving. It could only be described as death and rot in an extremely concentrated form, bad enough to be one of Calli's braps. After about forty five seconds of the nuclear holocaust Mumei's ass unleashed, she finally stopped. Looking around, there was no trace of the city anymore. Just a poisoned wasteland that stretched as far as the eye could see.

"Wow. I guess that was a bad one, huh? I still have plenty more, though. So what do you say we have a few more rounds of this contest?" straightening herself, Mumei tilted her head and smiled happily at her two genmates that were sprawled out on the ground.

Kronii could only croak out in a weak, hoarse voice. "L-Let's just call it a draw..."
