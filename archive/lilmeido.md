Mei Lan was born in a small, humble village nestled within the borders of a once-mighty mortal empire. From a young age, she displayed an innate talent for organization, precision, and an unwavering dedication to the service of others. Her parents recognized this unique gift and, in a stroke of fortune, decided to enroll her in a renowned maid academy within the heart of the empire.

Within the academy's walls, Mei Lan honed her skills as a maid, developing an unparalleled ability to maintain order and grace in even the most chaotic of environments. She quickly rose to become one of the academy's most promising students, admired for her impeccable attention to detail and her unshakable commitment to her duties.

However, life in the academy was not without its trials. Mei Lan's world would be forever altered when a catastrophic tragedy struck the empire, casting a shadow over the once-proud nation. In the wake of the calamity, her beloved maid academy was reduced to rubble, and Mei Lan found herself wandering the wilds as a displaced soul.

The wilderness was unforgiving and vast, and as panic and despair gnawed at her, Mei Lan experienced a manic episode. Consumed by her compulsion to maintain cleanliness and order, she started to clean the part of the woods she had taken refuge in. Leaves were meticulously arranged, and even the dirt beneath her feet felt the touch of her devotion to tidiness.

During her relentless pursuit of order, Mei Lan stumbled upon a hidden cave, a place untouched by human hands for countless ages. As she ventured deeper into its shadowy recesses, she uncovered a treasure that would rekindle her sense of purpose. Ancient scrolls, carefully preserved and bearing the knowledge of long-forgotten wisdom, lay nestled within the cavern's embrace.

However, it was not just the scrolls that left an indelible mark on Mei Lan's heart. Alongside the ancient texts rested the skeleton of a servant, dressed in unassuming attire but clenching the scrolls to their chest in a final, protective embrace. It was evident that this loyal servant had valiantly guarded the wisdom of their master even in their final moments, choosing to remain in their duty until the very end.

Mei Lan, struck by the servant's unwavering dedication and sacrifice, found a profound sense of purpose rekindled within her. It was not just her duty to maintain cleanliness, but also to safeguard knowledge and serve those in need, just as the servant had done for their master. Mei Lan felt an unbreakable bond with the unknown servant and pledged to honor their memory and commitment.

With newfound determination, Mei Lan emerged from the wilderness and embarked on a journey to return to the civilized world. Armed with the wisdom of ancient scrolls and her unwavering dedication to the role of a maid, she sought to serve new masters and protect their knowledge with the same level of devotion that had been her guide and inspiration through the tumultuous years.

Now, Mei Lan wanders the realms, seeking those in need of her skills and the legacy of the servant she found deep within the cave. She carries the spirit of her academy, the memory of the fallen empire, and the unwavering commitment of the servant's loyalty as she endeavors to bring order, wisdom, and care to all she encounters.
