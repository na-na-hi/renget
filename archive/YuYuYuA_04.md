Fu: Huh, Karin?
Ka: Oh, Fuu. It's you.
Fu: Come on, show some respect. That's senpai for you. Sen-pai.
Ka: Yeah, whatever.
Fu: What a coincidence, running into you like that.
Ka: This town isn't that big and there are only so many places we can go to.
Fu: So, what are you doing here on our day off, Karin?
Ka: I'm going to the beach. There's plenty of open space there, so it's perfect for sword training.
Fu: No you're not!
Ka: Uwah!
Ka: Wh-What was that about!?
Fu: Let's go see a movie, Karin. How's that sound?
Ka: Huh?
Fu: I have movie discount coupons, but they're for two.
Fu: I wanted to go see a movie now, but I'd have one coupon left.
Ka: Why do I have to watch it with you? Go with Itsuki.
Fu: My sister is hanging out with friends from her class today. They went to karaoke.
Fu: She kept her distance from others back when her voice was gone. As her sister, I don't want to get in her way when she's socializing with her classmates.
Ka: But I was about to go train...
Fu: Who cares about that, let's go!
Ka: H-Hey!
Ka: I ended up coming with her...
Fu: Our seats are... here and here.
Fu: Hmm, the cinema in the Ines in Daisoku would've had a bigger screen.
Ka: There's a cinema inside the Ines...?
Fu: Karin, could it be you don't go to the movies that often? You see this kinda thing a lot lately. Cinemas that are integrated into shopping malls.
Fu: And on the topic of stuff they manage to fit into mall: The Ines over in Oohashi even has a community center.
Ka: Seriously, a community center in a shopping mall...?
Ka: Oh, right. You haven't told me what movie we're gonna watch.
Fu: I don't know anything but the title, either. But I heard it's the number one hit this summer. "Your Sixth Name We Saw That Day".
Ka: That title doesn't tell me anything about its contents...
Fu: I'm pretty sure it's a romance movie. The tagline is "The story of a love that brought all of Shikoku to tears".
Ka: Geh, why do I have to watch a love movie with you?
Fu: What does it matter who you watch it with? This isn't a date or something.
Ka: Da-!?
Ka: Y-Yeah, that's true...
Ka: Right, I only tagged along because she had a ticket left over. It's not like I came to watch such a trashy love movie with a cookie cutter tagline...
Fu: What are you mumbling about? Oh, it's starting.
Ka: Nh, unh... I'm so glad... That twist at the very end... It wasn't a romance, but a story about the bond between a psychiologist and a boy...
Little girl: Mom, that girl there is crying!
Ka: I-I'm not crying! It's just my hay fever...!
Fu: ...
Fu: Ah... nnh...
Ka: Hm? What's wrong, Fuu?
Fu: It was scary! It was so damn scary!
Ka: Huh? How was that scary?
Fu: Didn't you see? That doctor was a ghost all along! He appeared like a normal human to that boy because he could see spirits, but he was actually a ghost!
Fu: That's fraud! "Story of a love" my foot! That was a horror movie! I knew something was off when I saw that "Sixth" in the title!
Ka: No, the doctor and the kid were helping each other recover from their emotional scars...
Fu: But he was a ghost! He was just haunting him!
Ka: Well... I can't deny that.
Fu: Nnh...
Ka: H-Hey, stop touching my face!
Fu: You're here, right, Karin...?
Fu: You aren't a ghost only I can see, right...?
Ka: As if!
Fu: Haah...
Ka: Have you calmed down?
Fu: Yeah, I think so... Sorry, I lost my cool...
Fu: Aah! There goes my dignity as club president... as your senpai!
Ka: Don't worry, you never had any in the first place.
Fu: Wh-What was that!?
Ka: It's always been obvious you can't handle ghosts and horror and all that stuff.
Fu: Egh...
Ka: Anyway, we got these movie bonus pinbacks... give mine to Itsuki or something.
Fu: Hey, wait. What would she need a pinback from a movie she hasn't seen for?
Fu: Why don't you take yours home with you? It's not like it'll get in the way.
Ka: ...Well, I guess.
Fu: Hm, what are we gonna do now? It's still only noon, we have time.
Ka: There's a place I want to stop by since we're already in the shopping district.
Fu: Are you gonna buy something?
Ka: I want to buy clothes.
Fu: Clothes!? Fashion!? Karin, you!?
Fu: The same Karin that normally says stuff like "I don't care what I'm wearing as long as it fits" or "The niboshi print on this shirt looks stylish"!?
Ka: Hey, you got a problem with niboshi!?
To: That was a wonderful movie, Yuuna-chan.
Yu: Yeah! The ending was surprising, but it made me cry.
To: Fufu. You're cute even when you're crying, Yuuna-chan.
To: Oh? Isn't that Fuu-senpai and Karin-chan?
Yu: Ah, you're right. Hey, Fuu-se...!
To: Tougou Guard!
Yu: Mgh! Wh-Why did you cover my mouth all of a sudden?
To: We shouldn't interrupt Karin-chan and Fuu-senpai when they are deepening their friendship. Let's leave them alone.
Yu: Ah, yeah, good idea! I want Karin-chan to get along better with everyone!
To: Well then, let's eat lunch and head back. I know a good udon restaurant not far from here.
Yu: Yay, awesome! Tougou-san, you're the best!
Ka: Great, I got the clothes I wanted.
Fu: Yeah, yeah.
Ka: What's wrong? That's one unenthusiastic reply.
Fu: You said you'd shop clothes... but that's just training wear!
Ka: Well, it's getting colder these days. I had to buy something for winter.
Fu: Uhm... what about fall and winter outfits other than training wear?
Ka: Oh, the ones from last year will do.
Fu: The other way around! It's supposed to be the other way around!
Ka: Huh?
Fu: Oh, geez! Come with me! We're going to a real fashion shop.
Ka: Wh-Why!?
Fu: Here, try this on!
Ka: Wh-Why did you drag me to this place all of a sudden!?
Ka: And what's that, a skirt? It's hard to move around in those.
Fu: You've gotta wear something girly once in a while. You're cute, you just don't let it show.
Ka: H-Huh!? Cute!?
Fu: Yeah. And I'm not just saying that because I'm biased towards my fellow club members; I really do think so. You should try wearing outfits like this once in a while.
Ka: I can live without that...
Ka: More importantly, this year's latest style of training wear - the one I bought in the store earlier - has been ergonomically designed so that simply wearing it will-
Fu: Drop the training wear already!
Fu: Oh man, the Hero Club's girl power has dropped considerably... You're supposed to talk about this year's fall collection, not the latest training wear!
Ka: What does it matter?
Fu: I know! How about a miniskirt? Oh, but you should wear knee highs or tights or your legs are gonna get cold around this time of year.
Ka: No thanks, I'll stick with last year's clothes after all.
Fu: Why!?
Fu: We didn't buy any in the end...
Ka: Whatever, I don't need them.
Fu: Tomorrow's Hero Club activity will be "boosting Karin's girl power".
Ka: Don't. You. Dare.
Fu: Karin... I'm worried. About what will happen to the Hero Club after I graduate...
Ka: Fuu...
Fu: Karin, well, we just saw what you're like. And Itsuki turns more and more helpless the longer you leave her alone.
Ka: ...
Fu: Tougou is ladylike, but sometimes the national defense takes over. Sonoko is kinda impossible to gauge...
Fu: Yuuna has quite a bit of girl power, but... she's too obsessed with sports.
Fu: When I graduate, the Hero Club might face a girl power shortage!
Ka: It's not like you're contributing much girl power even when you're here. Nothing's gonna change next year.
Fu: Th-That's not true! It can't be!
Ka: You don't even know yourself, huh?
Ka: All right, I've got everything I came for...
Fu: Ah, I wanted to go shopping for dinner. Come with me.
Ka: Sure. I have to get something for dinner too.
Fu: What is going to be for dinner at the Miyoshi household tonight?
Ka: Hmm, good question. I had too many convenience store bentos and got tired of them... Maybe I should try a supermarket bento this time.
Ka: And I have to buy vegetable juice.
Fu: That's still just a bento!
Ka: Unlike convenience store bentos, supermarket bentos come in many different variations, so they constitute a nutritionally balanced diet!
Fu: Same difference! That's six of one and half a dozen of the other!
Fu: Good thing we bought it during the special sale!
Ka: So that's how it is. You needed me to carry your groceries.
Fu: Exactly.
Ka: Anyways, what was that earlier? Whenever I tried to buy a bento, you got in the way yelling "Club Prez Block!" and stuff like that.
Fu: Listen, you can't live on convenience store or supermarket bentos alone. You've gotta do your own cooking.
Ka: Either way, I need something to eat for today. I guess I'll order something.
Fu: Oh no you won't!
Fu: Come to my place. That's why I bought a bit more than usual today.
Fu: All right. I'll get everything ready, stay where you are.
Fu: Oh, I got a text from Itsuki.
Message: Itsuki: A friend invited me to stay for dinner, can I eat there?
Fu: Let's see, "No problem. But don't stay out too late."
Fu: Itsuki said she won't need dinner today.
Ka: There was no need to buy more ingredients then.
Fu: Nah, you're probably gonna eat more than Itsuki anyway.
Ka: Still not anywhere near to how much you're eating though...
Ka: ...
Ka: Is it still not done?
Fu: It hasn't even been three minutes since I started. You'll have to wait ten minutes at least.
Ka: Cooking takes time, huh... A bento only needs five minutes in the microwave!
Fu: Why are you proud of that...?
Fu: You know, the wait is part of the fun of cooking.
Ka: One, two, three...
Fu: Why did you start doing squats!?
Ka: If I have to wait, I don't want to waste the time doing nothing.
Fu: Behave yourself while you wait at least!
Ka: All right, if you say so...
Ka: Thanks for the meal, it was delicious.
Fu: Yeah, glad you liked it.
Fu: Hmm, you have surprisingly good manners, Karin.
Fu: Like how you use eating utensils. Or how you say "time to eat" and "thanks for the meal" every time even though you're usually eating alone.
Ka: Things were pretty strict back at my parents'. I tried my hardest to be a perfect student so I wouldn't be outshined by my brother and to win my parents' approval. I have my manners down pat.
Fu: Then why are you never being respecful when you're talking to me...?
Ka: ...I could do that. I'll treat you with flawless respect and courtesy for my senpai if you want.
Fu: ...On second thought, I think I'll pass. I'm feeling really uncomfortable just thinking about it... that wouldn't be Karin anymore!
Ka: It kinda pisses me off when you say it like that...
Ka: Anyway, that was an unusual way to spend the day.
Fu: Hm? What do you mean, unusual?
Ka: I didn't train at all. I've never simply relaxed on a day off before.
Fu: Do you not even notice the obvious contradiction in that?
Ka: Huh?
Fu: Days off are days off because you take a day off on them. Diligence may be a virtue, but too much and it becomes a vice.
Fu: Forcing yourself to live an overly harsh live can warp your mind. Getting strong won't be any good if you turn yourself into an emotional wreck on the way there.
Fu: Keeping your mind in good shape is more important than gaining strength! And those without a healthy mind should stay away from power. They'll only end up hurting themselves and those around them.
Ka: An overly harsh life, you say...
Fu: I don't know the details of how you lived before you became a Hero, but you went through pretty intense training, didn't you?
Ka: Well, yeah... But hasn't your life been harsh too? You lost your parents in elementary school.
Fu: I managed to get over it because I had Itsuki. And thankfully, none of the others in the Hero Club are unstable now... So make sure to keep both your body and mind in shape, got it?
Fu: Anyhow, don't overdo things or be tense all the time; live in moderation and be gentle with yourself. And make sure to relax on days off; have fun!
Ka: Yeah, I got it.
Ka: Keeping my mind in good shape, huh...?
Fu: So, that's what happened today.
It: Then you were with Karin-san the whole day.
Fu: Oh, now that you mention it. We were together from morning till night.
It: Hihi, poor Karin. She got manipulated by you.
Fu: I didn't manipulate her! It's the president's job to keep an eye on the club members' daily lives and guide them to the right path!
It: Yeah, yeah. Oh, by the way, have you studied for your exams today, Onee-chan?
Fu: Ah!??
Fu: I forgot! I didn't study at all!!
It: Onee-chan...
Fu: B-But a day off is a day off because you take the day off, you know? I'm gonna study tomorrow...
It: No.
It: I want you to pass the exams, Onee-chan.
Fu: Okay... I'll fulfill my studying quota for today. Doesn't seem like I'll get much sleep tonight...
Fu: Two circles of equal radius... overlap at two points... prove that they are congruent...
Fu: Zzz...
Yu: Looks like Fuu-senpai didn't get enough sleep... But she usually never falls asleep in the club room.
Ka: What the hell was she doing...?
So: This is very strange... I wonder why Fuumin-senpai is sleepy today~.
So: Oh, what do we have here~? This pinback wasn't on Nibosshi's bag the day before yesterday~.
Ka: Whoa!?
So: And there's a matching one on Fuumin-senpai's bag!
So: I got it! Master Detective Sonoko-san's little gray cells are making their deduction!
Ka: A deduction of what!?
So: This means that Fuumin-senpai and Nibosshi were together yesterday!
Eyewitness testimony:
Witness T-san: That's right. I saw them in town yesterday. They seemed to be getting along well.
Witness T-san: Then they went somewhere together...
So: ...That's the verbal evidence we have. And then there's Fuumin-senpai's mysterious sleepiness today. Could it be...!?
So: My imagination is running out of control~~~!
Fu: Mhmn... be gentle... Karin...
So: My pen is writing on its own~~!
Ka: Make it stop!!
