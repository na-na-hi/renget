 -> *{I'm just going to say right now - pronunciations are just as much of a clusterfuck as the creation myth. There's basically no consensus, and usually given as complicated phonetics for what we understand how hieroglyphs were pronounced (with similar issues for Babylonian Cuneiforms and Mayan Hieroglyphs), crutching on Greek-Latin (sometimes Arabic) when we have no clue. All of them are just as likely to be wrong as right, and if there's any actual Egyptologists reading this ~~fuck you you're all awkward cunts to work with, I want to blast a bullet through my skull when I deal with you pieces of shit~~ you should agree that there's always quite a bit of dispute within the field to begin with ~~and then you're going to shut the fuck up and not spend 10 minutes elaborating the point nobody to asked you to elaborate while we're in the middle of a fucking desert and you're hogging the shade. I hate having to listen to you bastards drone on with yourselves, I just want to slit your throats like the arabs we were surrounded with, but for different definitions of faggot. You're an embarrassment to higher education, and the only religious death rites you'll get from me as the 43rd Judge of the Duat is when I spit on your corpse fuck you all I've never worked with a 'good' egyptologist because they don't exist~~}* <-
