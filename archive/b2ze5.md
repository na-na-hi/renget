#R&R
##Pt.1

The sun had not yet risen over Empire City. The sky was still dark with very few stars hanging against it's blackness. The junkyard was graced by the bit of morning dew that formed on derelict pieces of furniture, rusted out cars, and other pieces of garbage. The misty smell of wet garbage hung in the air. It was a horrid smell to most everyone, but for one, it was a refreshing smell of absolute freedom. 

Riley rummaged around for a spare part for one of her junkbots. The early dawn before daybreak was the optimal time for her. Naturally nocturnal, she would get a lot of work done during the night whenever she felt productive. "Goddamnit. I know there was another cylinder around here somewhere." She grumbled to herself. She tossed aside a few pieces of garbage in her search for the part. She knew the junkyard like the back of her hand. So much so, that she could tell if even the smallest bolt or ragged garmet was missing. 

A small pile of junk shifted. She stood quickly and quieted herself. Her violet colored eyes scanned the junkyard carefully in the early morning darkness. Her nose twitched as she sniffed the moldy, rotten air. Despite all the smells of old food, stale oil, and stagnant rancid water around her, she managed to pick up an unfamiliar scent. It wasn't Dan's smell of sweet apple juice, or Rico's possumy scent. Besides, Dan had been busy with a new friend he found. She was oddly similiar to him. Rico hadn't been around in a few days. It was common for him. He came and went as he pleased. This scent, however, had her on edge. She sniffed the air once more. "Not a MERC mook. Doesn't smell like gunpowder and tears. Smells like...different garbage." 

Riley growled lowly as she began to go to the source of the foreign odor. Another bit of rubble moved. She quickly darted towards it. "HEY! WHO THE HELL IS THERE?!" 

The only response she received was another small movement from another trash heap. Whkever this intruder was, they were quick and managed to move about in the crowded junkyard with ease. She continued to follow the movements and started to track the path in her head. Her eyes widened with the realization that they were headed towards her junker bunker! It was one of the many paths she managed to make. How did the intruder know?! This had to be one of Eggfuck's bots or whatever loyal lackey he managed to find to do his bidding. Had she'd been watched? For how long? Riley quickly made her way to a rusty, gutted out school bus. 

All the windows were boarded up, save for one that she used as an entrance. She slipped inside of the bus and started to look over the collection of handmade weapons that lined the walls. There were numerous guns made of pieces of badniks and scrap metal, robo arm cannons that were converted into wearable pieces, and a few made of oddities found in the junkyard. 

She didn't need anything too fancy for what she was about to pull. Riley selected a blaster made from various metal pipes known to her as BB, short for *Basic Bitch*. She climbed out of the bus and watched the movement amongst the trash. She took aim and gave another growl. "Alright, BB! Don't let me down!" She pulled the trigger and a large makeshift ball of junk launched towards the moving target. It crashed into one of the piles of junk and caused an avalanche of garbage that buried the target completely. Riley rushed over to the collapsed heap as she crammed more junk into BB. As she stood ontop of the trash, she took aim as a gloved hand broke through the surface. "STOP RIGHT THERE, ASSHOLE!"

Another hand popped out and pulled the rest of the body attached to it up through the filth. "Gah! What the hell did you do that for?!" He stopped as he saw the barrell of BB pointed at him. "Whoa, take it easy!" He placed his hands behind his head slowly. 

"Fuck you! You're trespassing!" Riley gave a hard look to the other raccoon that decided to sneak in. She raised her brow abit as there was something oddly familiar about him. Mainly his eyes. "Who are you and what the hell are you doing here?" 

"Lower your shitty gun and I'll tell you." He gave a fanged smirk. 

"Fat fucking chance! And BB is not shitty!" She huffed. 

"Ah, well. I should've know you weren't going to make this easy." The male raccoon pressed one of the spikes on his glove that acted as a secret button. A small flying junkbot appeared in a flash. It crashed itself into Riley and knocked her over. Yhe fall caused her to loose her grip on BB. She was taken by surprise! The junkbot was similiar to one of her own!  "How the fu-!" She was stopped short as the junkbot whizzed by as she tried to reach for her pipe gun. 

"Uh, uh, uh!" The male raccoon kicked the gun out of her reach as his junkbot flew around him. "You wanna talk or settle this? I think I already know the answer." 

Riley let out a frustrated snarl as she scrambled to her feet and lunged at him. 

He easily dodged her meager attack. "You gotta be quicker than that!" He teased as he dodged a punch thrown by her. 

"Fucking stand still!!" Riley shouted in frustration as she threw another punch. She gasped as he grabbed her arm and flipped her over effortlessly. She was slammed down into a pile of trash. Bags busted open and bits of old food clung to her fur and hair. She gave a quick snort and got herself up. "WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU?!" Her patience was as short as her temper.

"I'm Ripley! I'm you! In a sense." He chuckled.

"Bullshit! You're one of his bootlickers aren't ya! Get the fuck outta my yard!" Riley charged at him and threw more punches.

Ripley moved out of the way of each one thrown at him. "Now that's just offensive! How could you think I would work for that bastard?" His smug smirk fell as Riley crouched downn whipped her tail around one of his legs, and pulled it out from beneath him. 

He fell on his back. His violet eyes widened as he just barely rolled out of the way of another downward punch. "I'm telling the truth!" He jumped onto his feet and dodged another punch. He delivered a blow of his own to her side. "You're middle name is Cortenzia!" 

Riley winced from the punch and gave him a look of disbelief. "H-how the hell-you could easily find that out!" She ran towards him tried to tackle him. Ripley's junkbot came down on her back and thrusted her to the ground. The pain made her writhe and a groan left her. 

Ripley stood over her and held out his hand as his junkbot landed in his palm. "You're the sole surviving member of your family. You could go back to wealth, but you choose to live in filth. Why? Because your father said you were trash for leaving. That you were a disgrace for not following in his footsteps. But you would show him, wouldn't you? You'd live in garbage and make the most out of it. You'd be happier living in trash than supplying that twisted fuck. You spoke to him the day he died. He tried to convince you. You told him he's dead to you. Quite the last words."

Riley glanced up to the raccoon standing over her with silent shock. 

"I know this because I went through it, too. Only it was my mother and my sisters. We sure showed them didn't we? We're still alive and content in our filth. We are trash." Ripley offered his other hand to her to help her up. 

Riley hesitated at first, but slowly took his hand and got to her feet with his help. "How'd you get here?" She finally asked. 

"Eggma'am opened some portal. You didn't see Dan and Dani?" Ripley raised a brow. 

"I just thought he made a new little friend. It's good for him to be around children his age and not..." her face fell abit. 

"Around you? Getting into schemes? Seeing you fucking a pack of raccoons?" He smirked. 

"It was ONCE! I told him to stay away from my special dumpsters." She huffed, though the look on her face showed how bad she felt. "I know I'm not the best influence. For anyone."

"Ah, bullshit." He snorted. "You care for him more than his mother does. You've gotten better. Getting him meals, even if you have to coerce 'Norm' into giving them to you. Making a safe place for him to sleep. Never thought you'd be a parental type, huh? Dani can be a handful, but I'd do anything for her. The little terror."

Riley was quiet, a small frown on her face. 

"Ah, what? Mad because I bested you and your shitty gun?" Ripley chuckled.

"Oh, go fuck yourself!" She growled. 

"That an offer?"
