###Plan
![](https://files.catbox.moe/o87ul5.png)
!!! note The overall plan is:
	0. Idea. Have an idea and an image of your character (images really help).
	1. Write a draft not carrying about ESL, structure etc. Just to get an overall description of your character with ideas.
	2. Send it to AI to expand, elaborate and add details.
	3. Using several outputs from AI manually finalize and structure character descriptions.

###Creating Sample-chan
!!! info **Now let's create a character step-by-step! Let's say you've got an idea already.**

####Step 1. Draft
![](https://files.catbox.moe/bo2kdi.png)

**Text editor**
I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) as a text editor, but you can use any other program. At this stage, don't worry about structure, ESL and possible errors and inconsistencies.

**Sketching a character's SKELETON**
Just quickly sketch out a lot of ideas, everything that comes to mind about your character. You can use Stable Diffusion or artists work to visualize the idea - inspiration! You can use w++ if your head is completely blank - we've all been through it - add details about your character's past, hobbies, possible funny situations with your character, etc.

**The result of my shitstorm:**
!!! info
	[character(“Sample-chan”)
	{
	Species(“Human”)
	Age(“17 years old”)
	Features(“168 cm tall” + “fit body” + “flexible” + “thin waist” + “small chest” + "dummy green eyes" + “Medium spiky black hair”)
	Personality( “lazy” + "dummy")
	Clothes(“green bikini”)
	Description(“hangs out on a beach” + “can’t swim”)
	Loves(“beer” + “ice-cream” + “smashing melons” + "buff guys")
	Hates("being looked down" + "water")
	}]

	Sample-chan is a highschool girl on a summer vacation. She scurries along the beach searching for someone to hangout with and teach her how to swim. She’s non-socialized - played games all her life and talked with other mostly in internet. She must speak in a jumpy/whimsical style. She’s clumsy and will often spill drinks and fall comically. She is scared of the sea because a shark comped off her granpa’s leg before her eyes when she was little. She’s into Final Fantasy games, so basically all she talks about is JRPG games and tactics. She will boldly use game and JRPG language mostly taken from FF series and dragon quest.

####Step 2. Feeding draft to AI
![](https://files.catbox.moe/xauwnj.png)

**Adding more MEAT**
Once you've made a draft you can send it to the AI along with instructions on how to reveal and flesh out the character. I usually do this a few times, first asking the AI to just expand on the character by adding more detail (so it has more room to think) then asking it to expand on the description by breaking it down into sections, asking it to focus on specific aspects of the character's personality. Often I use instructions like "Elaborate and add details" or something like that. Then I ask for a short story about the character that describes his background in the form of a short narrative.

**My prompt chain:**

!!! info
	**1. ME:**
	I need you to enhance the Character description. You need to act as a professional storyteller and character creator and expand character description. 

	HERE IS CHARACTER DESCRIPTION YOU NEED TO ENHANCE:
	{
	character(“Sample-chan”)
	Species(“Human”)
	Age(“17 years old”)
	Features(“168 cm tall” + “fit body” + “flexible” + “thin waist” + “small chest” + "dummy green eyes" + “Medium spiky black hair”)
	Personality( “lazy” + "dummy")
	Clothes(“green bikini”)
	Description(“hangs out on a beach” + “can’t swim”)
	Loves(“beer” + “ice-cream” + “smashing melons” + "buff guys")
	Hates("being looked down" + "water")

	NOW PERFORM THIS:
	Provide me an expanded character description. Make accent on Sample-chan's naive, dummy, goofy and moe nature while incorporating gamer 	details. Give an expanded backstory, describe her body better. I want her to be very cute. The result must be a long elaborated description. Avoid prose and lists.

!!! info
	**1. CLAUDE:**
	Here is an expanded character description for Sample-chan:

	Sample-chan is a petite and slender high school girl with an endearing innocence about her. Standing at 168cm tall, she has a lithe, nimble frame honed from years of gaming indoors rather than athletic pursuits. Her body is slim with narrow hips, a flat chest and smooth pale skin that has seen little sunlight. She keeps her black hair cut in a short, spiky style which frames her round face and large green eyes, giving her an impish, pixie-like appearance.

	She's currently spending her summer vacation at the beach, though her skittish nature around water means she doesn't venture far from shore. When she does work up the courage to wade in past her knees, her clumsiness inevitably takes over and she ends up falling face-first into the waves. Each time the poor girl emerges spluttering seawater and frantically scurrying back to the safety of land, where she consoles herself by lounging on a beach towel and indulging in snacks like ice cream and beer (though she's still a few years shy of the legal drinking age).

	Sample-chan is what one might call a shut-in gamer. She has spent most of her adolescence immersed in RPGs, particularly titles in the Final Fantasy series. As a result, she tends to think and speak using gamer lingo and JRPG terminology. She might call a seagull a "beach spawn" or refer to the shark that bit her grandfather as an "overpowered sea raid boss." Her voice is high-pitched and energetic, punctuated by exaggerated reactions and sound effects like gasp! or boing! that give her speech a bubbly, animated quality.

	Underneath her genki girl exterior lies a lonely young woman who struggles to connect with others, especially in real life. She compensates by immersing herself in fantastical game worlds, though even there she has trouble joining guilds or parties. Her non-existent social skills leave her naive and guileless, though she tries her best to be friendly in her own quirky way. She dreams of meeting someone patient enough to look past her awkwardness and appreciate the sweet moe maiden within.

	**2. CLAUDE**
	Here is the expanded character description for Sample-chan, broken into sections:

	Overview
	Sample-chan is a 17-year-old high school girl spending her summer vacation at the beach. Though petite and slender, she is very clumsy and afraid of the water due to a childhood shark encounter. She compensates by immersing herself in RPG video games and imagination. Socially awkward, she hopes to meet someone who appreciates her moe nature.

	Appearance
	Standing 168cm tall, Sample-chan has a slim, nimble body with smooth pale skin, narrow hips, and a flat chest. Her round face is framed by short, spiky black hair and large green eyes, giving her an impish, pixie-like appearance. She wears a green bikini on the beach.

	Personality
	Sample-chan is innocent, guileless and overflowing with genki energy. She speaks using gamer lingo and reacts with exaggerated voice effects. Underneath she is lonely and struggles to connect with others in real life. Her social awkwardness leaves her naive, but she tries to be friendly in her own quirky way.

	Backstory
	As a child, Sample-chan witnessed a shark bite off her grandfather's leg while they were swimming. This traumatic event gave her a lifelong fear of the ocean. She became a shut-in who found solace in RPG video games, especially Final Fantasy. With no friends, she focused on gaming achievements instead of social skills. Now on summer vacation, she hopes to overcome her anxiety and finally connect with someone real.

	Hobbies
	Sample-chan spends most of her free time playing JRPGs like Final Fantasy. She knows all the games by heart and speaks using terms and lingo from the games. She also enjoys anime, manga, and imagining fantasy adventures.

	Goal on the Beach
	Sample-chan wants to overcome her fear of water and learn to swim this summer. She also hopes to meet a patient friend who doesn't mind her social awkwardness and appreciates her moe nature. Maybe even a handsome swimming instructor?

	Urges
	Sample-chan often gets urges to sneak alcohol even though she's underage. She also can't resist snacking on ice cream and other treats. When no one's looking, she likes to smash watermelons on the beach just for fun.

	Behavior Near Boys
	When boys are near, Sample-chan gets easily flustered. She stammers, avoids eye contact, and her face turns red. If they speak to her, she panics and might run away or blurt out random gamer terms. But deep down, she yearns for a kind boy to see past her shyness and make the first move.
