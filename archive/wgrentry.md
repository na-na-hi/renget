**Note to whoever's baking:** You'll need up to four images. Since you're the one who's baking, they can be whatever you want; just make sure they're about chuubas, they have some sort of theme (ex. all pics of Mel, all pics of Botan, all pics of Umisea members, etc.), and they're not NSFW (and/or coombait).  That's one image for the OP, and two for the Story Anchor and Story Recap. You'll need the extra image for the Writing Contest anchor/Voting Form post if there's a contest going on. 

Also, when linking the new thread (You) baked to the previous thread, **tell us about a story you wrote** or a story you read (if you're a reader). We have ways of verifying that stuff. The clearer you can make it that the thread was made by a person and not a bot, the better. If you want to go further, you can even **personalize** the OP and anchors using the stuff here as a guideline. We're fighting against literal machines here, son. If you ever fancied yourself being John Connor, now's your chance. Good luck!

One last thing. Please always double check the spelling of the Rentry link! It's https://rentry.org/**wgrentry**, not wg*renty*, or wgren*tyr*, or something else. Fake links may crop up sometime in the future. Don't buy fakes! Buy the original! Buy https://rentry.org/**wgrentry**.

## Special Section: Why OP Is a Faggot

1. tl;dr
>/wg/ has a writing contest
>/wg/ wants a new contest version of the OP to advertise it better
>/wg/'s threads, however, are automated. guy who automates the threads doesn't make a contest version of the OP
>/wg/ makes a thread with said contest version of the OP
>the guy who automates the threads spergs out and makes multiple threads either to take back control of the OP, get the general banished, make the contest look bad, or all three

2. He flooded the catalog with not one, not two, but 15 yes, **15** duplicate threads on August 1, 2023.
