# The /wg/ Rentry
-> *"OP is a faggot, and proud of it." - Anonymous* <-
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**Note to whoever's baking:** You'll need up to four images. Since you're the one who's baking, they can be whatever you want; just make sure they're about chuubas, they have some sort of theme (ex. all pics of Mel, all pics of Botan, all pics of Umisea members, etc.), and they're not NSFW.  There will always be three instances alluding to the poster's homosexuality at any given time. Any more or less than that means the thread is not legit. That's one image for the OP, and two for the Story Anchor and Story Recap. You'll need the extra image for the /wg/ Contest anchor if there's a contest going on. 

Also, **personalize the filenames of your images, especially the OP image**. The clearer you can make it that the thread was made by a person and not a bot, the better. We're fighting against literal machines here, son. If you ever fancied yourself being John Connor, now's your chance. Good luck!

One last thing. Please always double check the spelling of the Rentry link! It's https://rentry.org/**wgrentry**, not wg*renty*, or wgren*tyr*, or something else. Fake links may crop up sometime in the future. Don't buy fakes! Buy the original! Buy https://rentry.org/**wgrentry**.

## Special Section: Why OP Is a Faggot

1. tl;dr
>/wg/ has a writing contest
>/wg/ wants a new contest version of the OP to advertise it better
>/wg/'s threads, however, are automated. guy who automates the threads doesn't make a contest version of the OP
>/wg/ makes a thread with said contest version of the OP
>the guy who automates the threads spergs out and makes multiple threads either to take back control of the OP, get the general banished, make the contest look bad, or all three

2. He flooded the catalog with not one, not two, but 16, yes, **16** duplicate threads on August 1, 2023.
