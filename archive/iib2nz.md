###-> Cuddling on a Stormy Day <-
***

>It's 2pm in the afternoon
>The weather forecast was meant to be warm, sunny, perfect for a stroll in the park
>But what the fuck is this?
>It's raining heavily, you hear thunder in the distance
>Your park date with Shiorin has effectively been cancelled
>Instead she's on the bed
>Reading her book
>Once she's into her book, she won't stop until
>A little dejected you lay next to her
>But for some reason today's different
>She notices you and a small smile forms on her lips, unnoticed behind her book
>She starts to read to you out loud
>"Traveller, what's wrong? What thoughts have intruded into your head to give you such a sour look?"
>You know this isn't a line in the book she's reading, which means she's doing it again
>She's turning the situation into one giant play, with her the narrator and you the performer or actor
>You respond to her "I was meant to go on a date with my girlfriend in the park but the weather said no"
>She then puts the book down and rests her head on your chest
>"Poor traveler, the weather does not favour you today, but it's alright, for the sun will always shine, even in the dark"
>You're taken aback by her words, but you know she's doing this to cheer you up
>You reach over to rest a hand on her head
>"Ah, traveler, you must not go off script, please only listen to my voice"
>You stop and put your hand back down, she's gotten really into this
>She begins to hum while still resting her head on your chest
>You really want to caress her cheek, run your fingers through her hair, you can also smell her shampoo, it's pleasant
>She finally starts a new prompt
>"After the traveler listened to the bard's song, the traveler found himself in tears"
>Suddenly, inexplicably, you begin to tear up, as if it were a command sent to your brain
>"I'll allow it, you may hold me closely, allow me to be the light for you, as I have always done"
>You start to tear up more and hold her closely
>"Don't you have something to say?"
>You don't have to think, this prompt has come up before so you already know the answer
>"I love you Shiorin"
>"I love you too anon"

### -> An Xmas Eve Date <-

***

>Xmas eve
>Both of you had made plans for tonight to spend together
>It's nearly midnight
>You're walking around town, taking in the sights
>The tree still unlit
>Your phone starts to buzz
>It's from your parents
>They're wishing you a happy xmas, so of course you message them back
>However, that wasn't the only one
>It happens again, and again, and again
>Shiori is slowly losing her patience with you despite apologizing about it
>Finally after the next message
>"Anon, what's more important right now? Our date, or your phone?"
>"Shiori, please it's fami-"
>"And what am I then? You can respond to them later can't you?"
>She storms off, clearly mad
>Your shoulders slump, you fucked up pretty badly there
>You sit on a bench and look up at the sky
>Dark and clouded, snow gently falling
>You think about the things you two have been through this year
>After a while you resolve yourself to at least apologize properly
>You get up and look for her
>You find her by the giant xmas tree
>Suddenly you hear a bell ring, followed by the tree lighting up
>Her face is absolutely beautiful in that moment
>You take off your scarf and approach her while holding it behind your back
>"Hey Shiori?"
>She turns to you, still smiling but with a very slight hint of sadness behind that smile
>You wrap your scarf around her neck and pull her in towards you for a hug
>"I'm sorry, and..I love you"
>She starts to laugh a lot then responds
>"No anon, I'm sorry, I got a bit upset there, but I love you too"
>You share a kiss infront of the xmas tree
>She takes out her camera then gives it to a nearby couple
>She grabs your arm and tells you to make a pose infront of the tree
>She does a very silly pose while you try and do a more serious one
>The couple returns the camera and she giggles
>Once again you think to yourself "She's the most beautiful and treasured person to me"

### ->A Tragic Break-up<-

***

>You've lost count of how many times this has happened
>Another argument, another set
>Yelling at each other back and forth
>She use to think that you were the one that could finally understand her fully
>You tried your hardest, no one can say you didn't
>But it's not enough, you still misunderstand, you still forget sometimes
>She sighs and walks up to you
>"Anon, I'm sorry, I'll..try to change a bit"
>Hearing this hurts
>You don't want her to change for you, this isn't something you signed up for
>You loved Shiori for Shiori, you don't want her to change because of your faults
>But what else can you say? Your relationship is on its last legs
>A week passes, but it starts again
>The next argument
>She tried to talk about her husbandos to you again
>But you were too tired after work to properly listen
>What started it?
>She noticed and asked "Hey, are you listening?"
>In your exhaustion, you didn't respond for a bit
>A mistake for sure
>She apologizes then takes a deep breath and finally exclaims
>"Anon, I'm sorry, this isn't going to work anymore"
>"I can't even be passionate about the things I enjoy around you anymore"
>Suddenly you jolt awake, realizing what it is she just said
>"Wait, wait Shiori you don't mean that right?" You ask in a panic
>She looks at you, with sad and dejected
>"It's been like this for a while now, I wanted a partner that could take me at my best, at my worst, and everything inbetween"
>You've seen that look before
>Although she's sad, you know that her mind's made up, her face gives it away
>You slump on the couch and she pats your head one more time
>"Hey, it's alright, just because we didn't work out, doesn't mean you'll be like this forever."
>She's trying to cheer you up from this, as impossible as it may be
>"You're a strong guy, anon. You'll eventually find someone that's more your speed."
>She reaches over and kisses your forehead then your lips and whispers with a tear running down her cheek
>"I love you, truly, but it's painful living like this, it isn't healthy, so please understand me"
>She finally gets up and starts to pack her things
>You're in a daze, you feel sick, your world is slowly ending
>In your pile of depression you finally get up and go up to her one more time
>"Please. Shiori I'll-"
>She puts her hand infront of your mouth and shakes her head
>"That's enough anon, don't make this anymore painful than it has to be"
>You're stuck there, paralyzed from the fear of losing her, but you can't stop her because deep down you know she's right
>She finally leaves
>She's gone, it's over.

### ->A loss of ambition<-

***

>How many times has it been?
>How many weeks, or months. No, even years? You've lost count
>Another message from Shiori
>"Do your very best today anon, I believe in you!"
>However, you both know by now that she's at her limit
>You used to be an energetic anon with high ambitions
>You used to think the world wasn't enough to contain you
>Shiori was attracted to this ambition of yours
>She wanted to support you all the way and see your vision come to life
>You tried for several years to get closer to your desires.
>You failed
>But Shiori never left your side and continued to encourage you
>It wasn't enough
>Your despair was deeper than her words and actions
>Countless nights of just staring at the ceiling
>Even with her by your side
>Trying her best to comfort you, seeing you unresponsive
>She turns away from you, tearing up a little
>You can hear her, you used to comfort her when she got like this, it used to make your heart ache
>Now your lack of motivation just finds it annoying
>But the muscle memory is still there
>You half heartedly try to comfort her, you try rubbing the back of her head
>She and you both know it's just empty gestures though, but she's desperate and accepts it anyway
>Finally the last straw breaks
>She confronts you about all of this one evening
>She asks you where the old you went
>You get annoyed with all the pressure she keeps putting on you despite wanting the best out of you
>Your argument gets worse and then you deliver an ultimatum
>"If you can't accept me as I am now then just leave."
>She's stunlocked, tears practically forming
>"I'm sorry then anon, I can't do this anymore."
>She starts to pack her bags
>You realize what it is you just said but it's too late to stop it because both of you know deep down that you meant it. You meant every word.

###->The Fantasy Battle<-

***

>It's the final battle
>The world is shrouded in a thick layer of black
>All but this tower
>You and Shiori are side by side
>Against the one that caused this to begin with. Chaos.
>You were originally tasked with a duty to save the world
>You went on an adventure with other people including Shiori
>However, you were betrayed by them all
>All except for her, she stayed true and stayed with you all this time
>A hard battle is fought
>The only sounds that can be heard are the wails of the dead, your weapon against Chaos and Shiori backing you up.
>Finally, you land the killing blow on Chaos.
>But, nothing you expected to happen occurs.
>The darkness isn't being lifted
>Instead, Shiori calls to you in a silent, but desperate whisper
>"Anon?.."
>You turn to her, and then you see it, your despair quickly takes you over
>Shiori is slowly being taken over by the remains of Chaos
>She starts crying in her right eye, the other already overtaken, her right arm still clutching on to a knife
>"Anon..I'm sorry, I guess I'll be betraying you too." She says tearfully, ready to slit her own throat to not let her possession happen
>You walk up to her, all the previous betrayals have broken you, you feel nothing, or so you thought
>Suddenly, tears start streaming down your eyes too
>You resolved yourself to end everyone that came in your way, your former friends, allies, even family if they had been corrupted
>Now the last person that needs to die is right before you
>You hesitate, your tears come down harder
>"Anon, please, hurry..before it's too late." 
>She tries to stab herself in the throat to spare you the pain of doing it yourself
>You catch her arm and then you gently whisper in her ear
>"You were always there with me to the end, I swore I'd kill you or myself if one of us got corrupted..but I can't."
>Her left arm, now fully possessed, starts to strangle you
>You barely manage to utter the next words as you feel life fading from you
>"Please live well Shiori..you were always my guiding light.."
>Then suddenly, it stops
>Her left hand lets go of your neck
>She falls onto the ground, her head resting on your arm
>You call out to her, surprised, shocked, desperate even
>Then you hear the soft sounds of her breathing and her chest slowly rising up and down as if in a comfy slumber
>Your words had helped her regain control
>And then finally, your surroundings start to fade
>Your mission is complete, you did it.

###->Date ending in a rainy day<-

***

>It's a sunny day out, you were preparing for this for at least a week
>You finally had the courage to ask her out for a date
>Your heart was practically still, hoping you wouldn't get turned down
>To your surprise, you didn't. She said "Yes, I'd love to"
>Now in the present day, you're out together, walking in town
>You felt content, holding her hand, her by your side, smiling
>You point out a few places you could go, an arcade, a library, and a small cafe.
>She agrees to it all, and has a story for each place
>Her stories always captivated you, and others around you
>But just for today, those stories would be for you alone
>You're feeling giddy, you can't believe how this happened
>Your day has gone by blissfully and now you're sitting at the cafe with her
>She's sipping on some green tea while you're having a coffee.
>You ask her what kind of books she picked up at the library while you were there with her
>"Oh, just some murder mystery, and some psychological stuff, those always excite me!"
>You smile at her, and she smiles back at you, her smile leaving you feeling entranced.
>As the two of you exit the cafe
>Rain starts to fall down, it's heavy
>Your perfect date was going so well until this point
>Shiori then turns to you and apologize "Ah..anon, I only have a small umbrella, here you can use it."
>She hands you a small umbrella, there's no way both of you could use it
>You return it to her, then you take off your coat and hold it over your head with one hand
>"Huh? Are you sure?" she asks you, concerned about whether or not you'll get sick
>You smile at her and nod, then you take her hand again with your free hand
>She blushes a little bit, but accepts you
>Then the two of you start walking back to her home
>The heavy rain isn't letting up, but it doesn't bother you
>She looks at you a little concerned from time to time, but she still smiles, feeling a little comfortable with you
>The walk is long, a storm has even started, though none of that matters
>She decides to change the mood a little, and tells you a story involving a long storm
>You listen to her, you squeeze her hand when she gets to an interesting part, and she recognizes it and is happy, knowing her story is enough to distract you both from the storm
>You finally arrive at her home, where she leaves the umbrella with you
>"Thank you for today anon, you can use this to get home and you can give it back to me next time!"
>"Next time", the words resonate in your heart and mind, this isn't a one and done deal, there'll be a next time, and that leaves you smiling at her
>She then kisses your cheek softly and says "If you can make the next date just as exciting, then the next kiss will be here"
>She taps your lips, then heads inside
>She waves at you one last time
>And so, your almost perfect date, became perfect, as you now have the next one lined up.

###->Kouhai (and follow-up)<-

***

>You were always decent at everything in classes
>Not enough to call it straight A's, but definitely not enough to get F's either.
>Always in that C to B range
>Shiori comes up to you
>Tests are coming up
>You only know one reason why she's here
>"Senpaaaaaai" she calls to you in a cutesy tone, already you can tell that she wants something from you, but you can't resist the cutesy tone at all
>She knows you can't resist it as well, so she leans in closer to you
>"Senpaaaaai, I suck at geography and we have a test coming up..wanna help me study?"
>You don't even put up a fight, you just agree to it
>You start helping her study, pointing out different places for her in the US, Japan and EU
>She's surprised by all the different places, she tries to say them out loud but they all sound funny and mispronounced
>It doesn't bother you, her cuteness is something else
>She smiles gently at you and whispers to your ear
>"Hey hey senpai, if I don't fail this test because of you, I'll give you a little something!"
>Your heart starts to beat faster, a tinge of red appears on your cheeks
>"Uh..alright, do your best." You barely manage to utter this response, then the time for the tests begin
>After classes that day, you're ready to go home
>Your tests went well, the lecturer marked them all pretty fast
>Shiori runs up to you
>"Senpai senpai look look! I did it! You're so smart!"
>She puts her arms around you and gives you multiple kisses in a row, on your lips, cheeks, just all over your face
>You go red as a tomato instantly
>She then takes out a plastic easter egg, inside of it is some japanese candy, and a couple bugs
>She happily eats the candy and gives you the bugs
>"Hehe, thanks senpai! I'll see you tomorrow!~"
>She runs off gleefully
>You realize; "She's not going to eat dinner is she?" and then you start chasing after her, your moral compass will not let her skip out on a proper dinner.

***

>"Hey, Shiori, remember how I taught you geography?"
>She turns to you, her usual gentle smile plastered on her face
>"Hmhm, does senpai need myyyy help now?"
>Emphasizing the my, she likes the idea that she has some knowledge that you don't
>Her gentle smile turns into a cheeky smirk
>"Alright, senpai, how can I help you today?~"
>You're taken aback, her usual cutesy tone has been replaced by one of utter mischief 
>"Uhh..biology..I need some help with it."
>Her smirk only gets bigger, she pokes at your tummy gently
>"Hmhm, biology, yeah I guess I could help you out, after school right?~"
>Your face goes a deep red, you can't tell if this was just a hidden innuendo or not
>She leans in and whispers into your ear
>"I'll teach you allll about the human body..both male and female, especially female. Just meet me here after class instead of going home..okay?~"
>She drags her hand along your hip as she whispers that
>Your entire body freezes up but your heart's beating way faster than usual and you notice you've probably gotten horny over that display
>After classes are over, you stay back
>Shiori walks in with a lab coat and a mannequin
>"Alright senpai! I got permission to use this! I'mma teach you all about the female body with this!"
>Part of you knew that this is exactly what she meant, a small part of you is disappointed that it didn't lead into something more
>She sees your face and instantly sees everything you felt
>"Hey, I can't give you a reward unless you do well you know! Focus up on this and maybe those little thoughts in your head may not just stay as thoughts!"
>That line instantly snaps you back to reality, you're ready to focus on Shiori's lecture.
