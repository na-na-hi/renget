>place was called "madam saanvi's"
>you'd stumbled upon it by accident on GPS
>advertised itself as a gentlemen's club
>you knew what that meant
>initially you scoped it out from across the street
>trying not to be creepy or draw too much attention
>the place was over by the harbor, so close you could smell the salt water
>the exterior of the building looked like it remained unchanged since the 60s 
>not that it was in disrepair 
>on the contrary to keep it looking authentic must have cost a small fortune
>you'd never been in such a place so to find out one was in town this whole time was fascinating 
>right under your nose
>it was hard to imagine what the interior was like
>you'd heard horror stories from friends about such places
>dirty food, dirty seats, dirty girls
>still, you were curious
>worst case you leave 
>best case you get a drink and see "things"
>the offer was tempting so that's what had you on the street corner
>the building was two stories, classy everything down to the windows 
>after some inward debate you found your balls and walked across the street
>the music hit you first and then the smell
>it was a definitely not some contemporary band
>you'd thought maybe this wasn't correct on the GPS
>What place is playing live 60s music
>you felt like you were stepping into some sort of creepypasta
>as for the smell it was a sweet fragrance with a hint of spice
>what surprised you was when you entered
>you expected trashy strippers and an interior you'd have to clorox just to touch
>instead the closest thing he compare it to is some fancy steakhouse or something
>just with waitresses in lingerie 
>patronage seemed a little low but the night was still young
>the girls were nice eye candy of course
>all different types
>however when he saw the stage that's what changed his mind from mere curiosity to total obsession 
>to call the girl onstage a stripper is a disservice 
>a peacock built like a ballet dancer
>slender legs worked her around the pole
>practiced thigh and calve muscles flexed around the metal and you instantly knew where you wanted to be
>eye shadow and lipstick complimented the blue feathers
>delicate fingers worked the metal pole with a dexterity that made you blush
>green hair in a knee length ornate braid flowed like water around the dance
>a train of green and gold feathers right above the rump caught the eye
>had to stick out something like four feet
>her chest had the slightest bit of white plumage and was completely exposed
>that was such a simple thing to see so much exposed but so exciting
>venturing downward her waist was covered in a purple and gold corset
>when she pulled away from the pole that's when the other shoe dropped
>you remembered they were called "peacocks"
>that wasn't a she
>and you were still rock hard

>you couldn't take your eyes off the dance
>you swore like a minute ago you weren't gay
>that was before
>there were so many girls here yet there was a guy dancing on stage
>that was strange in itself
>the peacock thrust against the pole
>in one fluid graceful motion he flipped himself upside down
>his limber body was so tempting
>you ended up getting a closer view 
>taking a table as close to the stage as possible
>he smiled at your boldness
>granted, didn't seem like as many people were watching as intently
>he slowly descended and crawled toward you on the stage
>you couldn't go back to women after the look in his eyes
>here was this slender guy, a work of art
>all bright rich colors and grace 
>the urge to touch was strong but you had to remind yourself that was usually frowned upon
>holy shit you wanted to kiss up and down those legs
>"You're new here, handsome"
>the soft music blurred into the background as the room seemed to vanish
>it was just you and him
>he reached out and pushed your jaw shut
>soft fingers held your chin up
>that contact sent lightning through your body
>a smile graced his face, watching his beak made you want to lean in for a kiss
>then he released you and you were awestruck
>his face went lower and his ass stuck up higher
>it was already a nice sight but then he unfurled his feathers in a display that initially made you jump
>all the while he locked eyes with you
>this was absolutely mesmerizing and you were charmed
>your world was greens and blues and golds and nothing else
>after what felt like eternity he packed back up and slowly rose up
>when he broke eye contact and finished his dance then you came back to reality
>you had to be a regular now

>the rest of the day and the next day and week felt like autopilot
>you'd just watched the most gorgeous thing ever proposition and gyrate in front of you
>all to the Four Tops in the background
>it was surreal
>was all of that just for you?
>you'd heard horror stories of guys falling for women in that career 
>but couldn't this be different?
>though maybe you were led too much by your dick
>that peacock did just shatter your whole world in a short amount of time
>like some sort of siren
>you'd replay the memory in your mind over and over
>it was just too good to be true
>but you didn't even throw money down or what not
>still, he paid attention to you and even showed off
>after he'd left you just had this hole in your heart
>and a burning need
>so you started showing up every week
>just to watch the dance
>the times when you didn't see the peacock on stage you walked away
>he'd ruined you for any girls
>might have even ruined you for any guys
>the announcer wouldn't introduce him for his dances, letting his actions speak for him
>made catching the shows a challenge 
>finally after a few weeks you got lucky

>he was on the stage once more
>different attire
>this clothing reminded you of some sort of belly dancer
>less clingy like the first outfit
>instead it flowed with his braids and tail feathers
>every roll of his hips meant to attract the eye
>the occasional kick meant to show off his legs
>a twirl to overwhelm the senses with flashes of color and movement
>all this grace and misdirection was more in line with a magic show than some sort of strip tease
>the outfit was even clear in places and billowy loose sleeves swirled in whatever direction his arms swayed
>it was gold where it was opaque enough to see fabric
>that bulge that had first shocked you was a welcome sight
>a clear veil over his mouth twinkled in the spotlight
>eye shadow complimented his eyes and gave him a far more exotic presence 
>even something as simple as scanning the room was almost fantastical when he did it
>you were once more enraptured
>you noticed familiarity dawn on him in his eyes when he saw you
>that was actually kind of nice
>no one else sat close to the stage so you decided fuck holding back
>after all giving him an audience worked before
>you caught a smile before he dipped down to meet you
>he didn't touch you but held your gaze for what felt like forever
>his hips rolling over and over as he kneeled on stage
>his hands smoothly caressing his slim body for what felt like just you
>gliding over features you'd kill to touch right now
>you were at full mast already watching this
>you decided to try something
>you had five bills, fresh from payday the day before
>when you stretched out the handful in offering he deftly plucked them from your hand
>then leaned in real close
>enough you could smell the perfume on him
>all while he watched you from the corner of his eye
>a look of genuine mirth played over his features
>inches apart and you had to restraint yourself
>he slipped that money into the waistband of your pants
>after that he rose and twirled in one smooth motion

>his eyes watched over his shoulder as he headed backstage
>that wordless exchange swept your feet out from under you
>he was absolutely bewitching
>you decided to hang around this time instead of just bolting like usual
>in retrospect that was rude
>to your credit you wanted the peacock 
>it was hard to convey just the amount of desire was running through your body
>he turned down your money
>just shoved it in your waistband
>so very close to your dick
>but why
>you decided to get to the bottom of this
>or at least investigate a little
>as much as could be done
>OK you didn't expect much
>for once you decided to actually eat here
>ordering from one of the server girls, some wolf with an ample bust line, you asked her a quick question
>"who was that? The dancer on stage?"
>"that's the owner"
>what
>you mulled over the burger after she brought it
>that made you ask more
>you apologized for being nosy
>it's just you liked the place and wanted to know more
>apparently they'd been open since the 60s like you figured
>the dancers took money like most places
>and the owner was indeed a guy
>in case you hadn't noticed the dick straining his outfits
>yeah you'd need to be a regular here

>so you'd apparently met "madam saanvi"
>maybe
>the peacock knew how to work his hips and ultimately wasn't that what mattered?
>the other man was going to stay in your dreams 
>you were sure of it
>he was glorious for lack of a better word
>at least the place was relaxing to be in when you weren't ogling
>the music was nice
>the food wasn't that bad
>you just sort of wished the eye candy came back out
>oh well
>maybe another day you'd see him
>one of the other girls came by and presented you with a feather
>"he wanted you to have this"
>one of his pretty tail feathers
>even smelled like his perfume

>when you got home the feather stayed on your nightstand
>it was like he was in the room
>the smell was so unique 
>yet you didn't know his name
>what kind of game was the guy playing
>twice he did these displays
>yet he turned down cash
>he owns the place
>yet he dances for no one in particular 
>at least that's what it seemed like
>no one really crowded around the stage
>he was dancing for just himself 
>maybe
>that was your best guess
>more importantly you stared at this feather lying next to your head
>your thoughts trailed off as you picked it up and looked at it
>it had the faintest glitter on it
>bringing it to your nose instantly made you remember him vividly
>you couldn't believe you had stumbled into this
>you needed him rolling those hips on your lap
>losing yourself in that train of feathers while he rode you reverse cowgirl
>getting to hear that honeyed voice groan as you plunged into him
>you couldn't go back to girls now 
>he'd seen to that
>that night you ended up furiously jacking off while smelling that feather

>the days went by in a blur until you got the confidence to come back
>you were struggling with yourself 
>not even your exs got you feeling this way
>and this was a guy who barely touched you
>those pretty eyes watching over his shoulder though
>you'd fallen into the deep end and were drowning
>you got lucky the next trip
>this time it was a clingy Chinese dress that was cut right to the thighs
>it also puffed up the feathers of his chest just a little, giving the slight illusion of say, an a cup
>just barely
>the red dress shined in the light and swayed between his legs
>the rear looked to be cut short and his tail covered his ass in place of clothing
>to say you were intrigued was an understatement 
>this time his hair was in one massive braid the thickness of your fist
>slender hoop earrings a glimmer of gold in the sea of his thick green locks
>he wore red garters over his legs but no underwear 
>they helped draw attention to his taloned feet and somehow the rough texture of his calves didn't catch the soft fabric
>sleeves covered his arms up to the elbow
>he held a Japanese style paper fan 
>the outfit was sort of piecemeal Asian look but you couldn't lie and say it looked bad
>you had actually caught him out in the floor before the performance itself
>or perhaps this was after it
>he was talking to the server girls
>that did seem like a manager thing to do
>you didn't want to be a creep and just stare so you took a table 
>one of the girls, the wolf from the other day, pointed you out
>you felt like you might sink into your chair 
>he turned to look your way
>this felt like a completely different interaction than when he was on stage
>it felt a little riskier 
>like there was a degree of vulnerability 
>you weren't scared so much as anxious
>up there the peacock felt like he was on a pedestal
>so far away
>down here on equal footing you felt like some random weird mook watching his tail feathers sway
>yet there was that same seductive glimmer in his eyes as you two caught each other
>you tried to look away but he held your gaze
>then just as quickly it was severed
>his conversation with the girls continued for a moment 
>he grabbed a menu and made way for your table, hips swaying the whole way
>his tail threatened to sweep the floor with every step 
>all the while he watched your reaction

>he leaned over your table, making sure to show off the mock cleavage 
>all the while a soft smile on his face
>"so," he broke the silence between you, "what do you want to drink, handsome?"
>his voice was like honey but still had just enough baritone
>definitely a guy despite all appearances right now
>you tried not looking right down the dress
>the struggle was herculean 
>you stammered out the first beer you could think of
>he took your order and quietly retreated to the bar
>he brought back two beers
>and then pulled the chair out opposite from you and sat down
>he opened up both bottles and presented you one
>"word around my humble little place says you've been interested about a certain dancer here"
>you were still nervous and he encouraged you to drink a little
>"asking all sorts of questions. now why would that be?"
>the beer stung your throat a little on the way down
>you rarely drank and it showed
>initially you nursed the beer until he swigged his down in a very unladylike manner
>"you've got to live a little boy. the night is still young."
>that got you to finish the beer quickly
>he had a waitress bring two more
>"don't worry. these are on me. consider them a gift, like that feather."
>liquid courage may actually be a thing or perhaps the whole thing was a placebo 
>it did seem to loosen you up a little
>"that's a good boy. feeling a little braver?"
>you took a deep breath and finally decided to speak up a little
>nothing ventured nothing gained
>you explained you initially came here out of curiosity 
>that you never went into a place like this before
>or that you didn't expect to find yourself liking a guy
>he smiled at that last tidbit
>"well don't worry. liking guys seems to be something we share in common."
>you felt something softly rub up and down against your leg
>"so never been with a man before at all?"
>for a second you hesitated
>then nodded 
>"I saw the way you watched me. no one watches me."
>the rubbing went further up
>how was he that gentle with talons
>you gulped and he watched your face intently

>"for future reference though, I'm not for sale"
>he enjoyed your side glance
>"now now. that's not an insult. I was flattered. what I mean is I enjoyed your eyes more than your money."
>being with a guy was so much more different than a girl
>you'd never met a girl this flirty with you ever
>the bedroom eyes alone had you throbbing in your pants
>"truth be told," he confessed, "I didn't expect to ever actually bag a guy."
>the rubbing finally reached your groin
>"we both know how hard it is to need something, it seems."
>he rested his hand under his face and just watched you
>it was taking everything not to ruin your pants
>you remarked how you were drawn to him the instant you set eyes on him 
>"even with the fact that I'm tenting this cheongsam like crazy right now?"
>you dick twitched against his foot at that exact moment and his eyes lit up
>a tone of actual joy seemed to seep into his next words
>"you really are genuine."
>you gave your name and asked for his, somehow able to keep up a front of calm while being stroked
>"well 'madam saanvi' was my grandmama, you can call me Sally."
>Sally was definitely working magic on you
>you were definitely gay
>and you were definitely now coming back here every night now
>amazingly he coaxed an orgasm out from you under the table
>maybe his dancer's legs and feet were just that skilled
>"Oh no~, sir."
>mock surprise in his voice
>"we must have spilled something on your pants. clumsy wait staff."
>he clucked his tongue in his mouth as he pretended to mull it over
>his smile grew as he leaned in
>"I'll just have to compensate you next time you come in."

>the evening settled down after that
>Sally finished the beer and relaxed for a few minutes in your company
>ended up excusing himself to take care of the place
>"please, please, don't be a stranger."
>before he slipped away he wrote down hastily on a napkin
>he handed it to you and walked over to the bar
>the girls seemed to flock to him and they scattered just as quickly at his direction
>business was picked up due to the weekend
>you watched Sally without thinking about it
>this tall graceful guy had a commanding presence when he wanted to
>you opened up the napkin and saw a phone number 
>there was little doubt who's number it was
>at least you hoped it was his
>though it's not like he would lead you on after all that 
>you hoped
>it did seem all too good to be true
>that got you jittery
>you had a few more beers
>it did help with you nerves
>however, you ended up with one too many
>one of the girls must have noticed 
>you were in no shape to go home this late at night
>you expected a taxi 
>in a drunken stupor you lost track of what was going on
>there was conversation 
>you could make out Sally's voice in the other room
>you were just a little bit before puking levels sick
>the rest of the night was a blur
>the next morning the pain in your head was the first thing to greet you
>hurt like hell
>you woke up on a strange couch
>interior of the room was very… 60s
>wait
>as addled as your head was you put two and two together quickly
>you were somewhere in the club
>not in the actual business part of the place
>it hurt to look towards any light but you scanned the room
>you realized you were near a big comfy bed
>warm lamplight still felt like a dagger behind your eyes
>purple poofy blankets covered someone
>Sally
>he stirred and turned to look at you
>"gave us a scare last night. what got you doing something that wreckless?"
>OK so you couldn't hold your booze
>learning experience
>but at least this pushed you into the "he's actually genuine" camp
>if he was fucking with you he wouldn't go this extra mile for customer service 
>you noticed he still looked pretty even without makeup
>he got up to get a glass of water for you and you got a good look
>a pink nightie and a pair of panties
>good lord he was going to be the death of you
>a clock on the wall said 3 AM
>so it wasn't even morning morning
>he came back and gave you water
>"took a couple girls to bring you up here. hopefully you've gotten that out of your system."
>you gulped the water down and were going to rise before he halted you
>"no pushing yourself."
>then inspiration struck him
>at least that's what you guess
>he guided you up and put him in his bed
>he pulled you to his chest and hushed you until you passed back out

>when you next woke up you could see sunlight flood the room around the window curtains
>Sally had apparently woken up ahead of you
>the bed was empty but you didn't have to search long
>he came back into the room, a cotton robe covering him from the slight nip in the air
>"good. breakfast is almost ready. hopefully you won't be missed at work today."
>oh shit he was right
>you rushed to yank your cell phone out and called work
>you never took off but thankfully the boss didn't give you too much hell
>he said you sounded like shit
>which, with the hangover, you agreed
>head still ached like a son of a bitch
>well at least you didn't have to worry about getting fired today
>Sally sat on the bed next to you, making sure to clear his tail feathers before he did
>"so? how are we today?"
>you felt better than last night
>at least you were conscious 
>you thanked him
>it was really kind what he did
>"nonsense. I couldn't just let you stumble around out there. hopefully I get to see you in my bed under better circumstances."
>there was a mirth in his eyes
>he patted your leg under the blanket and invited you to breakfast 
>"word of warning, I'm not the best cook"
>you needed a second and after a short trip to the bathroom you felt better
>his bathroom was even girly
>breakfast was waffles, ham steak and potato hash
>coffee was brewing in the pot
>the kitchen smelled nice
>you realized from the view he lived right above the club
>"I don't get to entertain company much."
>he pulled out a seat for you 
>then gave you a plateful after the food had cooled
>the table was so small he had to sit next to you
>definitely not the worst arrangement 
>"hopefully I wasn't coming on too strong last night. I'd hate to be the reason you drank that much."
>it was true, you had been very nervous
>you'd worried this was too good to be true
>you said as much and his hand rested over yours
>"I assure you, I wouldn't just give anyone else footjobs under the table."
>well that was one way to assuage your fears
>but it did it
>you were a lot more relaxed during breakfast 
>he was right that he wasn't the best cook, however it was still good
>he enjoyed watching you finish your plate and took the dishes to wash
>you thanked him
>"oh think nothing of it. I usually do cardio today after breakfast but I think I may skip that."
>would explain how he stays in shape
>"however, I can't afford to skip yoga. I'll be doing that in the TV room if you'd like to join me."

>you'd be a fool to turn the offer down
>after all you'd seen him dance
>though you remarked you didn't know yoga
>"Oh its easy. hope you don't mind me doing it in my underwear"
>oh no
>how horrible
>he caught the look on your face and smiled
>then leaned in super close to your ear
>"usually I do it naked. don't quite think we're ready for that"
>you gulped
>he guided you down the hall to a small room
>much like everything else the interior was a throwback
>even had on of those massive tvs that weighed a ton
>he procured a DVD from a shelf and put it on
>a yoga session 
>well that seem easy enough 
>all you had to do was watch him stretch
>with that limber frame flex and release
>he slowly disrobed
>made a show of it
>wiggled out of it slowly
>he made sure to put extra emphasis on his bare shoulders as he pulled the nightie off them
>he tossed the robe and nightie to you and bud you sit down on the couch
>he started the exercise tape and sure enough just did it in barely anything
>you were just as entranced as before 
>his hair was loose this morning, a wild green cascade
>occasionally he'd have to flick it out of his face
>the yoga itself was a sight, he could nearly bend in half
>you were impressed but had to ask
>why worry about flexibility that much
>he seemed to work just fine on stage
>"well a guy my age can't be too careful."
>wait what did that mean
>you wanted to follow up about that last comment but decided not to

>so you lounged on the couch nursing your hangover
>you felt like such a pansy getting that fucked up from beers
>at least it worked out way better than expected 
>it seemed like Sally very much reveled in eyes on him
>all the while contortions this way and that
>downward dog was your favorite so far
>couldn't help but notice he lifted his feather train every time
>normally gravity would have claimed it and it would cover his ass
>it seems he wouldn't allow that
>perhaps this counted as a private show
>a little less formal of course but you couldn't complain 
>he definitely had a knack for showing off
>occasionally, he'd glance over his shoulder towards you
>no doubt checking for a reaction
>well you had a pillow over your crotch now for a reason
>so reaction achieved 
>"you know, I usually grab a shower in the morning after a work out."
>you snapped to attention
>"oh~"
>he grinned over his shoulder
>"down boy. already imagining fun in the shower?"
>well he was right
>very very right
>how was he good at this if his love life was as much a drought as yours
>hell how was his love life a drought with him being, well, him
>"thinking about all the naughty things you could do in there?"
>he was definitely checking your reaction while he continued stretching
>"shame you might just have to wait outside. unless?"
>you hid your disappointment changing to relief in seconds 
>"I mean," he continued as he continued his exercise, "there IS a reason I skipped cardio today. can you guess why?"
>you were floored now
>hadn't even gone on an official date yet
>"let me give you a hint."
> as he said that he smoothly rose and bent over in one motion
>his fingers hooked his panties and he wiggled out of them agonizingly slow
>didn't watch you this time 
>he could feel your eyes on him
>the brief view of his hole and balls was obscured by his tail feathers
>so he had been teasing you before
>he straightened up and briefly twirled his panties on his finger before tossing them to you
>"so now you can cross 'strip tease' off your bucket list. let's get cleaned up. maybe"

>you noticed he put extra emphasis on swaying his hips as he guided you
>all of sudden your hangover was the least of your thoughts
>his body was just as enticing as the first time
>only this time you were able to see everything
>nothing was hidden
>you even liked his cock
>months ago you'd never swear you'd have thought that
>thought you were straight as an arrow
>now you were watching how gracefully everything bounced on this other man as he moved
>and it was making you rock hard
>he knew it too
>since he grabbed your dick when you entered the bathroom
>"all this for me?"
>his smile was bewitching 
>"just to let you know ahead of time, no butt stuffing. not that kind of girl on the first date and all."
>well you couldn't win them all
>"mayyyyybe second date. now let's find out what we're working with"
>he at least unzipped your pants and undid your belt
>he gasped when he fished out your dick
>he ran his thumb over the tip
>his beak was awkward to kiss but you both managed
>you took the next bold step and reached for his manhood
>this was it
>no more girls
>hell, no other guys if you got lucky
>he bucked against you as he pressed you against the wall
>both your tips touch
>"so I'm your first man?"
>his breath was ragged as he broke the kiss
>you nodded as you both continued to jerk each other off
>"well tell you the truth, you're my first too."
>you remembered he said he had trouble with men but 
>a virgin?
>and he was saying that like it'd turn you away
>if anything it was a plus 
>you'd have to chit chat about it later
>for now there were more important things
>"years I spent learning how to please a man and I never got to use it." 
>you pointed out you were more than happy 
>all while your hands both pumped your cocks 
>this part was easy
>you knew how to jerk off and just applied it to him
>knowing what a man liked was actually easy
>he went back to kissing you
>he even tasted good
>how was that possible?

>you had several questions 
>while your head was swimming you figured with your pants down you couldn't be any more vulnerable 
>why you?
>how? 
>it was all so bewildering
>you liked girls a month or so ago
>"I didn't think I'd ever actually fetch a guy."
>he stroked faster
>you stroked faster
>"I've been at this for ages. I mean here I was, 30 years old, and someone like you came in."
>he stroked harder
>you stroked harder
>"and you actually watched me. actually sat there entranced."
>he gave your cock a soft squeeze and smiled as you bucked forward
>"maybe you just needed the right man to waken this beast up. maybe, forgive this for being cheesy, it was love at first sight."
>maybe he was right
>it was a better explanation than anything else
>it did feel absolutely magical
>"God only knows your eyes on me got me excited. The second time you came in I had to gobackstage and finger myself."
>well it was good to know it worked both ways
>"I know it's weird but doesn't it just feel so right?"
>you had to agree
>his kisses were so soft and inviting you to push back
>practically begging you to take charge
>"we both needed a man. I think it's that simple. I really like you. do you like me?"
>you nodded
>it was more than like but this was going so fast and you were so confused 
>but this right here was the best you'd ever felt
>how was this guy 30?
>he looked like he just got into college
>he purposely kissed the tips of your cocks together
>he whispered into your ear
>"you going to get my feathers nice and dirty? go head."
>that was like a switch going off in your head
>you both furiously started jerking off
>he'd made himself really vulnerable there
>maybe deep down he was still scared you'd turn him away
>so you did something crazy
>you found your balls again
>grabbed him with your free hand and spun him so he was back against the wall
>then as you both came across your stomachs you planted the strongest kiss on him
>practically feasting on the other man

>you had grown so very addicted to Sally
>his fingers ran through your hair 
>your hands rested on his back
>he was so soft to the touch
>like silk dancing under your fingertips
>"so, that wasn't so bad was it?"
>the wet mess across your stomachs and softening cocks said as much
>this felt right 
>he hugged you tenderly, stroking your hair
>his beak nuzzled up to your shoulder and he sighed
>"I don't know exactly how I won you over, honestly. but I'm glad. you'll like me more than girls."
>he nuzzled you softly as he relaxed against the wall
>there was a comfortable silence that passed between you
>occasionally you'd grind against each other again and send new waves of pleasure through each other
>"remember that first dance? I can't explain it but it just felt natural. my tail feathers are only unfurled for a mate."
>he was right
>you didn't exactly rebuff him either
>in fact it enticed you further
>so he was your boyfriend now
>and you were absolutely committed to every inch of this blue, green, white and gold temple
>not bad for only a couple meetings
>you kissed up and down his graceful long neck
>burying yourself in his hair as he clung to you
>he was some sort of magic
>and it had weaved its way into your mind
>as smoothly as his hips rolled on stage 
>the urge to continue was strong but you stopped yourself 
>it was difficult but you remembered what he said earlier
>he might cave and end up giving himself completely then and there
>however you didn't want to force it
>you wanted to make it special
>fighting against primal urges you broke contact and guided him to the shower booth
>at least you didn't hide your erection now

>the shower definitely cleared your head a little bit
>Sally was welcome company
>you felt like the feeling was mutual 
>he was always warm but now there was even more between you
>his feather train being flexible did help
>even if did hit you a couple times
>that was a risk you were happy to take though
>you didn't need to talk a lot now
>he just cleaned himself like normal 
>no real attempt to show off
>he was still gorgeous though
>you asked if you could touch him more
>"why I thought you'd never ask"
>he spun and you were resting chest to chest
>he ran gentle lazy circles over your shoulder
>the embrace was more loving than sexual
>not that it couldn't happen at the drop of a hat
>it was just more about the comfort of the act now
>he yielded to your embrace and you let the water hammer both of you
>after cleaning up it was surprising that he was the first to break the hug 
>"how would you like to help the club?"
>you were curious
>"I always need hands"
>he winked at you with that last word
>you'd have to wear yesterday's outfit
>he wore something different compared to his dancing outfits
>still a dress that clung to his hips
>he pointed out bits and pieces of the place
>the context gave you a better appreciation of the club
>it was history
>Sally was a part of all this

>over the day you did oddjobs here and there
>the place was already clean
>the horror stories you heard from friends definitely didn't apply here
>Sally ran a tight ship
>he wasn't a bad boss from what you saw though
>just really professional 
>the girls were friendly
>a few already figured out what was going on 
>they encouraged it
>while the whole bar wasn't playing matchmaker, a few offered congratulations 
>they did the same for Sally, which was met with a flustered bird
>he insisted they get back to work
>you worked on scrubbing the kitchen 
>initially he said you didn't have to work that hard but you insisted 
>this has been an amazing time for how informal it all had gone
>the peacock smiled 
>"well hopefully that's not the only work you're assertive about doing."
>he softly chuckled after he whispered that
>the morning work seemed to just fly by 
>the place opened around lunch
>the cooking staff and servers came in after the cleaning skeleton crew
>slowly, customers trickled in
>the club wasn't the most popular but there were loyal regulars
>some had come for years
>the club didn't lean too hard into stripping, fancying itself a classier establishment 
>at least this is what Sally explained
>sort of like just a regular nightclub but with waitresses in lingerie 
>the dance stage didn't push the girls to take it off
>"my grandmama started this place. lean in hard on the exotic oriental stuff."
>he was grabbing a quick bit before the shifts really started
>"I intend to keep the building as is. thank God she was wealthy." 
>to keep something like this running he had to be loaded
>he handed you half his sandwich
>"got to watch my girlish figure"
>he said that with such a sweet smile
>it felt kind of weird being around the place and not being a customer
>Sally still made you feel welcome
>"stay the night again if you'd like. I'm not dumb enough to kick you out of bed."
>very tempting offer
>you did have work tomorrow
>but work wasn't too far away
>so why the hell not
>you asked if he would be dancing tonight
>"I think I'm done dancing"
>he read the disappointment clear as day on your face
>"relax, relax."
>he gave you a little dismissive wave
>"I'm done dancing for them."
>he gestured out to the small lunch crowd 
>then gently poked your chest
>"you get private showings. scared you for a second didn't I?"
>relief did come over you
>yes that had spooked you for a minute
>private showings
>that sounded good
>might even abolish the whole "no touching the dancer" rule
>something to look forward to

>madam saanvi's started to pick up towards the night and you began to understand better
>Sally was right
>the place wasn't completely trashy like a strip club
>it was warmer and less in your face
>there was titillating sights and sounds to be had, sure
>but it wasn't to the degree you'd need hand sanitizer just from being in there
>this was different 
>as for the club you felt like a third wheel at the moment
>you asked if Sally would be ok with you hanging out upstairs
>he agreed 
>"don't go too far," he replied
>"I'll need my teddy bear tonight"
>good lord he was a flirt
>you lounged about on his couch in the tv room
>it didn't quite feel right to use Sally's room just yet
>and the couch was still cozy
>it was odd to see streaming on a giant monster of an antique television 
>you put on some show as background noise and took a nap
>you woke up to Sally offering you a dinner
>"I hated to wake you. but I don't want you screwing up sleep for your job tomorrow. Plus, pizza."
>he had indeed had the kitchen staff make you both a pizza
>it smelled pretty good, even overpowered his perfume despite him standing right next to your face
>before you got up to up him a seat he decided your lap made a perfect perch
>the top of his work attire was quickly tossed aside
>"you don't mind a topless server right?"
>he laughed a little at his own joke and offered you a slice
>"afterwards I got us a messy dessert. I was thinking if I happen to spill any of that one of us will have to clean it up. don't need chocolate sticking around, you know?"

>you ate like this pretty easily
>pizza was easy
>it was good 
>occasionally, he would deliberately wiggle down on your lap
>he knew damn well what he was doing
>you wanted to say room for dessert though
>when you asked about it he asked you to close your eyes
>you did as told
>he rose up and pulled you to sit up
>you raised your eyebrow and almost opened your eyes
>then he flicked your forehead
>"naughty boy. no peeking."
>you hear the clatter of a can
>then his hands deftly undid your belt and slid your pants down
>"as good as our lovely kitchen is, they didn't have what I wanted for dessert."
>your boxers were next to slide down
>"a banana split"
>a can rattled and you felt something cool touch your shaft
>now you couldn't help but peek
>he was decorating your cock with whipped cream
>next came chocolate syrup
>"aren't you glad it's my cheat day?"
>with that he took one slow smooth lick from base to tip
>all while looking you directly in the eye
>he ended it by flicking the tip playfully
>it took seconds for your cock to turn an angry hard red
>"oh did I do that?"
>coy as can be
>good lord
>his fingers played with your balls
>loving the fullness of them
>he pushed his face to your cock and inhaled deeply
>his tail feathers unfurled behind him at this
>"goddamn you're the man I needed."

>his tongue danced over your dick
>the whipped cream and chocolate was quickly lapped up
>the delicate fingers teased your manhood
>he wiggled his ass in anticipation 
>that impressive train displayed just for you
>"I hope you like it"
>there was genuine happiness in his eyes as he toyed your cock
>the beak made things different
>however he didn't let that stop him
>his fingers softly massaged your balls
>the whole time he savored your taste
>it was like he was getting drunk off your cock
>you definitely liked it
>when your hand brushed through his hair he moaned against your cock
>you gripped his head and just rode it out
>your hands on him enticed him further
>he started sucking you off 
>the underside of your cock lathered in his tongue
>soon he was gagging himself
>eyeliner running down his face while he looked up into your eyes
>he was pulling out all the stops now and you felt close
>you growled out as he sucked down every single burst
>after a moment he pulled away, his breath was ragged
>"not bad for my first time right?"
>holy shit
>holy 
>shit
>this was your man now
>and you were his
>you ran your hand through his hair affectionately 
>this was like a dream
>women were pointless now
>this beautiful dancer had saw to that
>you noticed his fidgeting 
>you knew exactly what that meant
>this was the deep end now
>no going back
>you pulled the other man up and sat him next to you
>before he could ask what you were doing you decided to return the favor 
>you had to know if you were really into guys
>no more bullshit
>no more on the fence
>you were stroking and licking his cock like he did yours
>it was weird
>but it was Sally
>that made it OK
>what amazed you was how he reacted
>he was a babbling mess just from a blow job
>in less than a minute he came across your face
>he pulled you up to his face
>"you naughty naughty boy

>he ended up licking your face and then kissing you
>well if that wasn't the final nail in the coffin for your heterosexuality
>you were kissing a guy with his own cum on him tongue
>you leaned in harder to the kiss
>he pulled you against him tight 
>the kiss was amazing as last time
>he broke the kiss first
>he was weakly smiling
>"you're definitely the man I've been waiting for."
>he tenderly ran his hands over your back
>"as tempted as I am right now, I want to go slow before you take this bird's virginity."
>you didn't want to push him to do it either
>"I want it to be really special. something we'll both look fondly on. after that there will be plenty of time to manhandle me."
>you cuddled on that couch for what felt like hours
>it was still a mystery how he was single
>your luck was amazing
>eventually though he noticed the time
>"come to bed boy. I don't need you being late to work because of me."
>like you had to be coaxed to sleep with him
>you decided to shock him though
>before he could get up you picked him up bridal style
>he was amazingly light
>getting picked up like that made him squeak
>he grew accustomed to it quickly though
>leaning into your shoulder as you took him to bed
>you placed him gently on the bed 
>his hair a sea of green on the black bedspread
>he smiled at you
>"definitely dreamboat material. trying really hard not to be impressed here"
>both of you chose to sleep in the nude, cuddled together
>his feathers were soft against your skin
>parting in the morning for work was like having to choose what tooth to pull from your head
>he had gotten you up and gave you coffee
>"good luck today, hope to see you again soon."
>he kissed you before you headed out, a simple peck on the cheek
>work couldn't be over quickly enough today

>a couple months had passed
>you were very much a regular to the club
>every night after work you'd come over
>Sally was happy to greet you every visit
>he even took off time from the club to spend time with you
>something that surprised the other staff
>he never took time off
>you relished in the company and did a couple informal dates at his club
>he had genuinely brightened up a lot, if the waitresses were to be believed
>occasionally 
>well ok, a lot, you both got lost in urges
>your preference was pretty clear now
>your dick worked for Sally and he worked for your dick
>once, after popping your cock out of his mouth he declared "I wish this right here was my full time job"
>you were both guys and it just came natural to be horny around each other
>he took a lot of pleasure in teasing you
>so after almost three months together, he surprised you with a special invitation 
>complete with lipstick mark
>in a first, he closed the club early for the night
>employees got paid leave for the night
>this bird really was loaded
>the only employee was the bartender 
>he was just there to open the door for you
>after you were in his shift was done
>you said goodnight
>he said to have fun
>it was very certain you would
>the club had been darkened except for the stage
>you took up a seat close 
>his entrance was impressive 
>he threw the curtain back and clung to the fabric above his head
>his eyes demanded your attention in the best way
>the tail feathers were open and gleaming in the spotlight 
>he was just as fetching as the first time you saw him up on stage
>this time his went with very basic
>a glittery thong was all he had on besides makeup
>he slowly walked towards you, deliberately putting emphasis on his hips
>he threw his braid back as he stood feet away from you
>"I told you I only dance for you now, so I'm making good on that."
>exclusive access was wonderful indeed
>with any luck dances wouldn't be the only thing you'd be getting exclusive access to tonight
>the feather train went down slowly as he moved, until it was completely tucked away
>he knew when to best use that particular weapon in his arsenal 
>Sally approached the pole and threw his ass out towards you
>his hand slid up the pole
>always watching over his shoulder
>the music he selected was something low and romantic
>you were going to get lucky tonight

>he twirled around the pole in slow circles
>all the while he watched you
>his leg extended out for balance as he just drew you in
>he was good at grabbing your attention 
>talented at it
>his grace all on display
>you had gotten lucky
>though he often said he was the lucky one
>neither of you could agree on that
>so it was just an agreeing to disagree
>he ended up climbing the pole, his legs flexing to hold him up 
>his flexibility was on full display as he contorted upside down
>his hands worked the pole behind him suggestively 
>all the while his legs flexed 
>he smiled
>after spinning around for you a little he let himself down and crawled towards you
>"you know what's special about tonight's show?"
>you didn't know
>"I get to select a lucky member of the audience for some participation"
>wow
>he hooked two fingers into your shirt collar 
>he pulled you up on stage
>he started grinding into you like he did that pole
>he thrust his ass against you, occasionally the tail feathers would emerge and overload your eyes with color
>how did he always smell so good?
>the urge to touch him was strong and he saw that
>"ah ah naughty boy. no touching the dancers until they say so"
>he twirled to face you and yanked your shirt up
>you weren't fighting that
>he rolled his hips against yours and traced his fingers over your bare back
>he purred into your ear
>"truth be told, we're both getting lucky tonight on this stage."
>he ground his dick against yours
>his leg hooked around your back
>"now be a sweetie and pick your boyfriend up. I swear you won't be disappointed."
>it was not surprise how light he was
>what was surprising is when he used you in lieu of the stripper pole
>a thigh was locked around your head as he threw up the other leg
>which meant you were face to cock with him
>he mimicked what he did on the pole and bent backwards
>he hooked his hands on your pants and wiggled them off

>your underpants were quickly tossed to the side
>you held onto his waist as he got comfortable 
>the material of his thong rubbed against your face
>even his crotch smelled nice
>he gently untangled himself and did a handstand that smoothly had him bend forward and plant his feet back on the stage
>he rose, giving your dick a quick glance before rising to meet you face to face
>"that flip was one of the first things I learned from grandmama." 
>he laughed as he embraced you
>"I guess I can't let you be the only one undressed on stage. do me the honors?"
>he fished a small bottle that had miraculously rode next to his narrow waistband the whole dance
>you had a feeling you knew what it was
>best invitation 
>his thong was easy to slide down
>fuck he was hot
>it finally hit 
>you had figured out after the first couple encounters you were gay
>but this was the big plunge
>the feathers were back out in full force
>he made you happy just like this
>somehow you were the guy of his dreams
>and you were taking his anal virginity on his stage
>he guided you to a regal chair he had set up on stage 
>no doubt just for this occasion 
>so you were getting a lap dance too
>tonight was a good night
>he set you up and decided to slide right into your lap
>the familiar feel of his cock to yours was just as special as always
>he rubbed your face into his fluffy chest and he swiveled against you
>"I've wanted this for a while. this is perfect."
>his hands grabbed your head so he could motorboat you properly
>every little move against him sent pleasure through you
>he was committed entirely to making this as magical as possible
>your hands gripped his ass
>"oh my~, you brute. planning to have your way with me?"
>even here, with how flustered and nervous he was still flirty
>he ground against your lap with a whimper
>his body thrust against you
>he was practically begging for it
>it took everything not to just grab him
>so you made due squeezing his ass
>something that made him gasp into your shoulder
>"do me a favor, pry my ass apart"
>his wish was your command
>your fingers pulled away his cheeks from his hole
>he bucked his hips at the sensation 
>"fuck, you know how tempted I am to let you go all caveman on me? but first…"
>he brought out the bottle and covered his fingers
>he ran little circles over his hole while he shuddered 
>his other hand slathered your cock
>"do me another favor, honey."
> you asked what it was
>"I don't want to be able to sit right tomorrow."
>you could manage that
>he made eye contact the whole time he lubed you both up
>his feathers were on display for his mate again
>precum leaked from the tips of your manhood
>"I've dreamed of this since I was a teenager. I need to give you all of me."
>satisfied he pulled himself up and guided your cockhead to his twitchy virgin hole
>the lube made sinking down on your cock easy
>the effort of filling himself slowly was enough to make him cum all over himself 
>his insides clamped down hard on you as his orgasm hit him
>after a few seconds he recovered
>"well that was embarrassing. I guess I was a bit excited"
>you pulled him into a kiss and he melted in your touch as he kept sliding down your shaft
>when he bottomed out he whimpered into your mouth
>his body held onto you like it didn't want to surrender it
>he was basically milking you just sitting there
>after he felt right and a minute or so passed you picked up his ass
>he whined and his cock twitched
>you bottomed out again
>picked him up and then bottomed out again
>he whispered into your ear
>"fuck I love you"

>you replied you love him too
>his asshole was just about the best thing possible
>maybe all the workouts he did
>somehow
>you didn't have time to ponder it
>instead you needed to fuck this man
>with your hands on his hips you picked him up
>out of the chair and everything
>he squeaked against your shoulder 
>he was light enough to use like like a fleshlight and you would be a fool not to try it
>after all he said to wreck him
>and you were dead set on making it memorable 
>he lowered himself and gripped your knees from behind
>"this might make it easier,"he groaned from between your legs
>you took the invitation and the sound of wet meat on meat slapping mingled with the slow romantic song
>his moans were almost a song
>you just couldn't help yourself now
>the guy that haunted your dreams and showed you how good men were was in your grip
>blowjobs, handjobs, hotdogging, frotting 
>all of that led to this most intimate of feelings
>he thrust to meet you
>all the while screaming your name
>he shocked you by contorting around you
>his leg hooked around you and he spun on your dick as it bottomed out
>again with treating you like a stripper pole
>you didn't mind at all
>his back faced you and he hooked an arm around your shoulder
>you hooked your own arms around his legs and behind his head
>"fuck fuck fuck I love you so much"
>his cock made a mess at your feet as you fucked him effortlessly in a full nelson
>he was practically a sex toy now
>there was love there too though
>he begged you to kiss him and you did
>this was amazing and everything you imagined
>you were his mate and you craved him completely 
>you made love like that for over a half hour before you couldn't hold back any more 
>you filled his ass with a messy load before you collapsed to your knees, careful to gently let him down
>you both laid down on stage for a while, cuddled up on the hard floor
>"you're totally cleaning up this" 
>then he laughed and buried his face in your shoulder
>he lost count of his orgasms 
>"I think this is the dirtiest this stage has ever gotten"
>it was your turn to say a declaration of love first
>he blushed and replied "I love you too"
>a year had passed 
>time went on and things got better
>the club seemed to perk up with its owner
>business was doing better
>his dances were just for you
>he liked having you around more than he could put to words 
>after your lease was up he offered you his place
>how could you say no
>as for work
>well, you'd taken a shine to bartending and the current guy was reaching retirement age
>you balanced work and bartender school 
>being able to breath a little money wise meant you could relax a little
>Sally encouraged it, even offering to pay for school
>but you wanted to do it
>he conceded as long as you made sure to use your experience as a way to do body shots off each other 
>damn near every night after work you couldn't help but get handsy
>your luck was unbelievable 
>on your nightstand was a momento, his tail feather, as reminder of that luck
