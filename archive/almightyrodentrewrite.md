# Almighty & Rodent Rewrite
It's a slow day at the Chaotix Detective Agency. With no work having come in days Vector lays back in his chair listening to music while Espio maintains his deep concentration at the side of the room.

Charmy suddenly comes flying in with an envelope in his hands.

"We've got work! We've got work!"

Vector promptly sits up in his chair as Espio walks towards the two of them.

"Let me see," says Vector, grabbing the envelope from Charmy's hands. He opens the envelope, taking out the note inside and reading it aloud to the other two.

"Dear Team Chaotix,

I am in need of your detective services for a personal problem of mine. For the past month my projects have been persistently interrupted by the same two creatures, a fake armadillo and squirrel."

Charmy butts in, "What's a fake armadillo and squirrel? A turtle and chipmunk?"

"Let me read th- how's a turtle look anything like an armadillo?"

"Because of their outer shells."

As Vector and Charmy begin to endlessly argue with one another about how similar a turtle and armadillo are Espio swiftly takes the letter from Vector and begins to read the rest of it.

"The two work awfully well together. Provided in the envelope are the coordinates to where I last sighted these two nuisances as well as photos of what they look like. If you manage to capture both of them you will be paid handsomely. In good faith, I have provided you with a quarter of your paycheck. You will receive the rest when the job is complete."

Hearing about money, Vector leaves his argument with Charmy unconcluded as he tips the envelope over, having his desk now flooded with money.

Immediately Vector's and Charmy's eyes shoot out big dollar signs.

"We're rich!" Charmy exclaims.

Vector adds on, "and this is only a quarter of this job's paycheck? We have enough money to never worry about rent again. Heck, we could even buy our agency now."

As Vector and Charmy fawn over all the money on the table Espio grabs the envelope from the floor, his eyes focused on the other contents of the envelope.

"I don't feel so sure about this case. It seems suspicious, especially considering these photos showing the two people we're supposed to track down."

Espio throws the photos in the air and hits them both with his kunai, nailing them to the wall.

Of these photos only two show the armadillo and squirrel by themselves in an autumn landscape, the rest all being photos of the two close together in various other settings, all taken at night."

Espio points at the armadillo.

"Doesn't he seem awfully familiar?"

The other two feel a strong sense of deja-vu overcoming them.

"Now that you mention it, I swear I've seen him before," responds Charmy as he tries to recall why that armadillo looks so familiar.

Espio tacks another point onto his previous one, "something else that makes me deeply suspicious about this whole case is that money you two have been incessantly eyeing since the start of this. If this much money is considered only a quarter of this job's paycheck then there must surely be more to this case than it lets on. I checked the coordinates and the only piece of information I was able to get was that it's located in that autumny forest shown in those photos. Besides that, we're going in completely blind."

Vector responds back to Charmy's assessment of the situation. "Though I do agree with you on how familiar that armadillo looks and the coordinates do seem fishy, we can't say no to this job. We've already received a portion of this job's highly pleasant money and it wouldn't be right to just scam this mystery person. It's part of being a detective Charmy, we have an obligation to take the cases that no one else would."

"Yeah! it's part of being a detective!" says Charmy.

Having convinced Espio of their moral duty to solve this mystery, Team Chaotix heads out to solve the case of the fake armadillo and squirrel, unaware of what awaits them.
