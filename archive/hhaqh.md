##### `The Servant and the Prince`
==(Part 1)==
>Tonight was the night of the royal ball. Diana had since been sent home for the day, but despite what happens to her every night, she couldn't stay away.
>Security was extra tight around the castle for this occasion. Being that she was one of the royal servants, she knew her way around like the back of her hand, or paw rather. Diana was able to expertly sneak past everyone and climb up to the ledge of a window sill where she could peer inside and search for one man in particular.
>She scanned the partygoers for awhile until her eyes rested upon him. Her heart nearly skipped a beat when she found the prince, but immediately felt disheartened when she saw who he was with. Prince Charles was dancing with his soon to be wife, princess Suzanne, the cold-hearted witch who's cruelty knew no bounds. In spite of her anger towards Suzanne, Diana focused intently on Charles. She leant against the window and let out a small sigh as she witnessed everyone waltz.
>"If only I could be there, my prince. I don't even know how to dance, but maybe you would teach me. Maybe I'm not wealthy, but I know I can love you unconditionally better than that bitch. *sigh* If only you knew I existed outside of being your clumsy servant girl."
>The dance went on for awhile, and eventually, the prince took his leave and left the ballroom. Diana wondered where he wandered off to, until she heard the opening of a balcony window just a few feet below her. Out stepped the prince, who walked to the edge and leant on the railing. He drooped his head down and let out a loud sigh. Diana sat upright and remained silent, hoping the prince wouldn't spot her.
>"Everyone's here. Everyone is here to celebrate and be cheerful, but why do I feel so empty then? Is it because of Suzanne? Perhaps she's pretty, but I find her actions to be so cruel and unforgiving to people. If only I wasn't being forced into this nonsense by mother. *sigh* If only I could find my true love."

>Diana's ears immediately perked up at that and began to listen more intently. The alluring mixture of the prince's cologne and scent became more apparant to her sensitive nose. She loved that cologne he wore, practically growing accustomed to it with how often she's near him. She wagged her tail swiftly as a large smile spread on her face.
>("Could it be true? The prince doesn't love her? Then maybe I do have a chance... Oh who am I kidding, even if I went to him and confessed... would he ever love someone like me?")
>Diana snaps out of her train of thought when she realizes the prince went back inside. She releases a sigh she didn't know she was holding and sits down. It's only now she realizes when she plops down in a small puddle that she was dripping arousal. She groans in a mixture of annoyance and embarrassment.
>"Oh you sexy man, look what you do to me. Just your scent alone gets me all worked up and bothered. Thank goodness human noses aren't so strong. I think I'd die of embarrassment if he saw me like this. That tears it, I can't go home empty handed. I need a fresher reminder of my love while I fall asleep."

>With that, Diana gets up and works her way around the castle to find the prince's chambers. She opens the already unlocked window and makes her way inside. She follows her nose to the prince's clothes hamper and pulls out a shirt he's worn today. Her mind is immediately flooded with the afternoon scent of the prince, putting her mind on cloud nine.
>A random creak from the floor boards snaps her out of the trance. She turns around to the source of the noise, and sees none other than prince Charles himself, standing by a bookshelf. Neither of them say a word, only staring at each other wide eyed in bewilderment.
>Diana was expecting him to scream and call for help, but he just stands there, not really knowing what to do. Diana in this situation would normally awkwardly excuse herself and run away, but the realization that she wasn't some ordinary servant girl right now made her smile deviously at the prince.
>She steadied her shaking legs as best she could, and walked slowly towards the prince. Trying to be cool wasn't Diana's strong suit, as she nearly trips over assorted books and clothing. She makes her way to the shelves and stands before the prince, puts a hand next to his head to keep him from leaving and merely stares at him.
>("Oh god I can't believe I'm actually doing this!") she said internally.
>"Well, you are much more handsome than I heard, your highness."
>"Y-you, know of me?" said Charles, still unsure of the wolf girl's intentions.
>"Of course I do. We forest creatures know all about the handsome and fair prince of the castle."
>"What do you want with me?"
>"Oh nothing much, just a souvenir for the road or two." said Diana, as she lightly glides a claw from her other hand across the side of Charles face.

>"The gold is on the counter... if that's what you want" replied Charles, a part of him hoping deep down that isn't what she wanted.
>The offer was tempting, but Diana had other ideas in mind: "Oh you are too kind. But I want something much simpler than that. I'll be keeping the shirt, but I want a kiss to remember you by."
>"A k-kiss?" Charles' breathing had begun to catch in his throat from the excitement.
>"Yes, a kiss. Don't worry, I won't bite... much."
>Diana began to slowly move her face to his. The prince closed his eyes, puckered up, and moved his head.
>("Ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh, he's really going to do it!") Diana's mind was practically racing with happiness.
>The two closed the distance and joined in a kiss. Diana's eager tongue had slipped into Charles mouth and eagerly began exploring him, the taste of fine wine and champagne overly abundant. Charles merely submitted to the eager wolfgirl, content she wasn't here to hurt him. The two shared in a long and sloppy kiss, the first kiss Diana ever had.
>They break off the kiss and pull back from one another, a long trail of saliva still connecting them. They both are panting trying to catch their breaths. Diana wipes the saliva from her maw and stares at the prince, with an overly pleased smile on her face. Charles stared back at her, amazed that anyone could have such power and desire for him.

>Diana gives a peck to the prince's forehead and says: "You are incredible, your highness." Not wanting to stick around any longer, Diana takes the shirt in tow and heads for the window.
>"Wait!" Charles exclaimed.
>Diana turned around, slightly afraid at what he would say.
>"I, uh, don't suppose we can see each other again, madame."
>Diana's fears are immediately put to rest. ("Madame? Now I can get used to that.") "Fret not your highness, I have a feeling we'll be seeing each other again. Very very soon."
>And with that, Diana exits through the window and out of sight. Charles runs towards the window to see her, only to realize she has since disappeared into the cover of the forests.
>("What a lady.") Charles reflects on fondly, as he leans on the window sill, in a much better mood now tonight than he's felt in a long time.
>As for Diana, she was running back home as fast as she could. With the freshly worn shirt in her hand and the immediate memory of her first kiss, she had plenty to use to pleasure herself to sleep. And what's more, the prince was eager to see her again. Maybe, she did stand a chance after all.

==(Part 2)==
>"Oh, darling, you look absolutely splendid!" proclaimed Madame Dufraine.
And splendid she was. Diana could hardly believe how beautiful the yellow dress looked on her. It complimented her complexion well, even accentuating the loveliness of her eyes. At least, that's what Madame Dufraine said when the two met in secret for the dress.
>As Diana stood in front of the three tall mirrors, occassionally giving a little twirl to look herself all over, she couldn't help but reflect on everything that led her here. It must all seem like a fairy tale, a dashing and compassionate prince, falling in love with his werewolf servant girl. Totally peposterous, and yet, it was all too real.
>Many nights of sneaking in and out of the castle, learning more about one another and their aspirations, all the while realizing that despite how different they were from one another, they were the only ones that truly cared for each other.
>And one night, prince Charles had sprung the question that led Diana here: "Would you like to attend the ball with me?"
>Diana merely froze with a wide eyed expression on her face. Externally, she may have looked fine, but inside, she was screaming at the top of her lungs in excitement and anxiety. Without even thinking, she replied: "Of course I would!"
>Diana quickly hugged Charles with all her might, which wouldn't have been an issue if she didn't nearly hug the air out of him. Sometimes she got carried away, but he was used to that by now, and after apologizing, the two merely laughed it off in good fun.
>It wasn't until she went home that night that the horrible realization dawned on her: "Where am I supposed to find a dress?!" Diana was by no stretch able to afford the fanciest dress possible to impress Charles, and it would be way too awkward to ask him if he could help with that.

>Of all the dressmakers in the kingdom, there's no way any of them could make a dress fit for her. And there's no telling if they would run away screaming and crying for help when she transformed at night.
>With the ball just 2 nights away, and options running thin, Diana sat outside of a bakery and sobbed silently to herself.
>"Whatever is the matter, darling?" a familiar, feminine voice said.
>Diana looked up slowly through her strands of brown hair and tearful eyes to see a older woman before her. It was none other than Madame Dufraine, who was practically like a sister to Diana's mom.
>"Oh nothing, it's just that I need an amazing dress for the ball but I can't afford one" Diana replied, a little more relaxed seeing a familiar face.
>"Really? Considering the event, I'm sure there might be a last minute sale in at least one of these stores."
>"It's not that simple Madame. I.. I don't think they can make a dress specifically for me."
>"Nonsense, darling, if none of these stuck up charlatans can help, then leave it to me." said Madame Dufraine as she helped Diana out of her chair. "Have a tissue, dear, a pretty face should never look so distraught. Now tell me, any 'special boys' I should no about?"
>"Uhm, well, the prince asked me to go with him."
>Madame Dufraine stopped on a dime, looking at Diana in disbelief. "T-the prince a-asked you? Oh this is fantastic news!" Madame Dufraine took Diana's hand in hers and began sprinting faster than anyone her age should be capable of. "Your in good hands, darling, with God as my witness, I will not fail you!"
>As the two made their way down the street, Diana noticed the sun was beginning to set at an alarming rate. ("Oh no! Have I really been out that long? I can't let her see me after dark! But... I need that dress.") Diana's stomach began to turn in anxiety about what may happen.

>Inside Madame Dufraine's boutique, Diana began to shift uncomfortably in her seat. Madame Dufraine may have closed all of the curtains to ensure no one would walk in the store, but Diana could tell she was running out of time. It didn't help that Madame D was humming to herself as she slowly picked through the large assortments of dresses.
>"Uhm, I don't mean to be rude, but is it possible we can go a bit faster?" Diana asked as she began to fidget in her chair.
>"You can't rush art my dear. Besides, this is the prince we're talking about. A girl's gotta look her best in front of royalty."
>Diana shuddered as a tingling sensation ran up and down her spine, with a strong sense of warmth coursing through her. Diana couldn't resist much longer, she had to get out of there
>"Beg pardon, but I have to go now." said Diana, as she quickly made for the exit. She tried to jiggle the door, but Madame D had locked it with her key.
>"But darling we haven't even tried your dresses on."
>Diana crossed her arms and began to pace side to side: "I know I know, but now's not a good time anymore."
>"Darling, are you ok?" asked Madame Dufraine as she reached a hand out to Diana, who quickly slapped it away. "Please, you have to get away from me before...."
>Through the boutiques skylight window, the rays of the moon shined down in the center of the store. Diana's eyes glossed over and her heartbeat audibly thumped in her ears, a low growl began to emanate from her core. In her last few moments, Diana quickly stripped down and prepared for the inevitable.
>An indescribable feeling of discomfort surged through Diana's whole body, accompanied by groans and growls, and all the while, Madame Dufraine merely watched as quiet as a mouse.
>Where once stood a fair skinned girl with brown hair, had now been replaced by a brown wifwolf of greater height. Diana covered her face with her hands, or paws rather, and tried to hide from Madame D.

>Diana was expecting the worse, to hear her scream in terror, or even worse, die from such a startling display. Instead, Madame Dufraine walked slowly towards Diana. Diana could feel two soft hands caress her own and move them away from her face.
>Diana was staring right at Madame Dufraine, who had a smile on her face. "You're much taller than I remembered you, little cub" said Madame D.
>Diana was perplexed: "Y-you knew?!"
>"Oh pisha, darling. Your mother used to pull all kinds of pranks on me when we were young. I always knew the best parts of her would get passed on to her little angel." she said as she gently caressed Diana's face. "Besides, I had a hunch this was why you were having trouble finding a dress."
>Diana merely blushed in embarrassment. Madame D continued: "Ya know, I had to tailor make suits for your mother too. You may be shorter than her, but I have a feeling I know the perfect fit." The two walked to the 3 mirrors and began trying on different designs.
>Fastforward back to now, the extravagant dress looked incredible on Diana. She was a little worried the sleeves had torn a bit, but when she turned to see Madame Dufraine, she saw her clasp her hands together with a smile and tears running down her face.
>"You truly are beautiful, darling. Oh goodness, I told myself I wouldn't cry but you look simply divine." said Madame Dufraine.
>Diana walked over to her and they both shared in a hug. "Thank you, Madame Dufraine. How much do I owe?"
>"Oh darling please, after everything your mother's done for me, this is the least I can do to return her kindness." Before she can even continue, she excuses herself to walk off and calm down.
>Diana merely looked back at her reflections, a solitary tear running down her own eye as well. She could hardly believe things were finally going her way, and the love of her life was in for a surprise on such a momentous occasion.
