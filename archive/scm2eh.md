#####Outer Wilds: 
Outer wilds is puzzle solving space exploration with a vr mod.
You explore a solar system and try to uncover its secrets.
Game progress is your knowledge of the story and puzzles, you could beat the game in 20 min if you have played it before or looked it up or it could take you 12 hours on a fresh playthrough.
Because of this i can't really say much about the game without spoiling except its good and you should pick it up.
