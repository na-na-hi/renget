Evalina Makarova is the spoiled daughter of Cheslov Makarova(Gun Runner, Owner of a Drug Empire, 4 time mayor of several towns on Dunwich's outskirts) and his 7th wife, who was instructed to teach Evalina to "become a princess" by her husband.  She took this order literally, homeschooling the girl until she was the most feminine and gentle thing in any room, them enrolling her in an all-girls private school where she learned how to dominate another person with and obligation.  
After she was educated, she was to be shopped around to be married to another prominent crime families son, but one day a rival cartel conducted a brutal assassination on Cheslov which sent the vehicle careening into one of the incomplete subway tunnels.  A kill squad slaughtered rapelled to slaughter everyone who survived the crash, but after mag-dumping into Cheslov and attempting to evacuate is his corpse, Evalina witness shadowy monsters tear the armed and armored men apart.  She survived only by abandoning her high-heeled shoes and sneaking out to the nearest station on blind luck and a refusal to die in such a gloomy place.
She took over the Makarova Cartel with the powers had gained, cursing men to die excruciatingly painful deaths for daring to even offend her ladylike sensibilities.  Even simply getting close while she is angry could break several bones and cause internal bleeding.  She is feared and coddled at the same time, her chief objectives being:
>Find a worthy "prince" to marry
>Recover her Father's corpse, and find a way to bring him back
>Find out which cartel killed her father and bring as much pain and grief on them as possible
