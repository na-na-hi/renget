**Prologue ~ Concealed Chaperone**

"Mhmm... H-huh?" I opened my eyes, "I-I'm drifting away...?" From what I could see, only darkness shrouded me, with no specks of light to be seen. Despite that, I can feel something pulling me somewhere, at least.

"B-but why...?" Fear grew more and more as I could think of only one possibility, leading to the same conclusion no matter from which angle I looked at it: "Could it be possible that I-I... no..."

My mind is hazy on what has happened. I clinch on the silver lining as I begin to recall my memories. However, with every passing second, I'm starting to forget more and more of my memories...Â 

What could have possibly happened? How long was I even here to begin with? Hours? Days? Or was there any such concept as time in this void? Far too many questions stack up with no answer...

I could at the very least feel my body, so I tried to wriggle around; that isn't where this invisible force is taking me! Yet at the end, nothing has changed, I'm still drifting in this dark void.

"If this is all true... please, I want to... go back..." I tried to hold back, but I'm at my limit, and my chest begins to overflow. "I don't want to..."

"I want to leave this place!!" I could feel droplets of tears dripping from my eyes in this darkness, knowing full well that this is all futile and I'm going to be stuck here until who knows what will happen to me. Though I'm still trying to be hopeful that this is all just some bad dream and that I actually didn't lose my life...

"...Anointed, you shouldn't be awake this early," a voice says from the back of my ears, then a vivid light fills up the dark space, "A-anyways, I finally found you! This path of light is the link between our two worlds..."
