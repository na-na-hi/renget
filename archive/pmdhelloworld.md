###->Hello, World!<-


This dream was different to my usual, half remembered ones. Contrasting to fantastical environments and nonsensical situations, this one was nothing but slowly scrolling text on a black background.
In the back of my mind, there was a slight recognition that I oughtn't be able to read in a dream, yet I could parse the words in front of me perfectly.

```
A cool breeze swept across my body, pulling me from my unconscious state and pushing away the last bits and pieces of the dream that I had been having into the inky blackness. As my mind slowly crawled into a state resembling awake, it eventually came to the conclusion that something was very wrong. I generally made it a habit to avoid sleeping on the floor - especially *dirt* ones.

My eyes flew open, and I beheld the scene that met me. Sunlight broke through the loose leaf cover of the canopy above me, making small pools of light on the dirt and leaf strewn floor. I attempted to push myself off the floor, to no avail. Looking down - instead of the human body I was expecting,  a bright pink and blue mess of geometric angles greeted me - a surprise to say the least.

It looked very much like I was in the body of a Porygon. It seemed that despite our long relationship, reality had given up and left - leaving me in a forest as a Pokémon.

`THIS MUST BE A DREAM.`
The sound of my voice shocked me. Staccato, scratchy and monotone, as if a bad recording was being played through 30 year old speakers, barely recognizable as my own. Still, my voice sounding strange was the least of my worries. If this *wasn't* a dream, I could think of a few options for things that could have happened.
1. I'm still in the real world, but a Pokémon.
2. I'm in the world of the main Pokémon games, as a Pokémon.
3. This is a Mystery Dungeon world and shit's going down somewhere.

None of those ideas seemed particularly reassuring. Either I'm going to be experimented on, caught and battled with, or expected to save the world from something.

Lying around on the ground seemed like a bad idea no matter which one of the three it was. No point in sitting here waiting for anyone to come by and gawk at and/or try to capture me - I pushed my doubts about reality aside and postponed my impending existential crisis - instead redoubling my efforts to try and move my new body.

***

A little while later, attempting to move my body seemed a futile endeavour. All I could seem to do was waggle the blocks that could be generously called feet, which was getting me nowhere fast. I wracked my brain. How did Porygon move? As best as I could recall, they just sorta floated about the place. How was I meant to get that to work?

I glared at a nearby tree I had set myself the task of getting to. This was insane - whatever or whoever turned me into a Pokémon couldn't be bothered to let me to know how to move? It wasn't even that hard of a thing to want to do! I just wanted to ==MOVE== to that tree!
```python
Destination set.
Beginning pathfinding. . .
Route found; moving.
```
I saw the words pop up in the corner of my vision. A faint green line seemed to extend from my centre, the other end inside the tree.
My body picked itself up from the ground, and floated towards the tree. As I reached the point I had been looking at, I began to hover in place.

`OH WHAT FRESH HELL IS THIS. I HAVE TO PLAY A FUCKING POINT-AND-CLICK ADVENTURE GAME TO MOVE AROUND.`

Idly floating next to a tree, I looked towards a different tree a little ways away, and concentrated on ==MOVING== there.
My body complied, hovering over to the other tree, automatically moving around the rocks and trees along the path.
Well, it seemed like I had figured out moving around at the very least. I wasn't going to be a sitting duck if somebody picked a fight with me - although it wouldn't be too difficult to catch up with my leisurely pace, and I had no doubts about being unable to defend myself from attacks.

I kept at it for a little while, moving between trees and rocks, experimenting with how my movement worked. Thankfully, it looked like the 'commands' - for lack of a better word - were fully interruptible. I won't have to worry about hovering off in a direction I didn't mean to go in. After making sure I had a little more experience with moving around, the sky had begun to turn dark. Being alone in the woods after the sun had gone down seemed like a bad idea - I had no idea what the natural predator of the Porygon is, and I had very little desire to find out.

Trouble was, I had no clue whatsoever where I was. I could be anywhere in the world (whichever world that it was) - and Porygons didn't seem to come with a GPS system built-in, sadly. Still, any where's probably better than a random clearing in the forest at night. While I was weighing up the chances of finding the nearest village/town/city and ending up in a Pokéball or a government test site, my thoughts were interrupted by a loud roar echoing throughout the forest.

With the decision of staying here or leaving made up for me, I headed out in the opposite direction to the roar - hoping that whatever I stumbled across would have some resemblance of civilisation.

***

I was utterly lost. Wandering through the forest in a single direction had gotten me nowhere - all the trees, rocks and small clearings had started to blend together into identical areas with no land marks. And to make matters worse, night had fully fallen, shrouding the whole area in an eerie darkness - only the full moon gave off any semblance of light. Actually - as I looked a bit closer at the night sky, there was no sign of the man in the moon, or any other recognisable stellar object. 

`I CAN SCRATCH THAT HOPE OF STILL BEING ON EARTH I GUESS.`

At least I'd managed to not stumbled into anyone in the darkness. I had the feeling that if anyone with even a single working eye was nearby, I would've been spotted instantly - I stood out like a sore thumb in the woodland environment; pink and blue were never the best colours for camouflage, unless you were hiding in an eraser factory.

I hovered silently over the forest floor, listening out for any noises that could be another creature. Thankfully, it seemed that none of whatever denizens lurked here were nocturnal, as the only sound I could hear was the wind rustling through leaves and the soft creak of branches swaying. I figured that I'd lucked out - however long this journey took, at least it was so far uneventful.

Perhaps thinking that jinxed me - as the next clearing I came up had what appeared to be a set of stairs slap bang in the centre. This cemented it. Either I was living out a creepypasta, or I've been shuffled off into a Mystery Dungeon game. Hopefully this was one of those games where it turns out the partner was the chosen one and not me. No way I'd be able to do anything like what happened in those games, considering it'd taken me this long to learn how to move. 

Still - I had a basic understanding of how these dungeons worked (if they worked the same as the games, that is). Manoeuvring myself closer to the incongruous masonry work, I got a much better look at them - perfectly made stone steps leading down, with the bottom shrouded in darkness. Looking at them, I knew that I wasn't getting out of here without an escape orb or reaching the bottom of this dungeon - and since I hadn't found any escape orbs on this level, the only way out of here was downward.

***

For a Mystery Dungeon, it was surprisingly empty. I'd not seen a single Pokémon while I had been floating my way through the level to the next staircase. Weren't these places supposed to be swarming with mad beasties attempting to beat the snot out of you? Not that I was complaining - if I could see the day out without encountering the Pokémon equivalent of a homeless crackhead, I'd score that as a win.

Figuring that this was one of the safer dungeons, I made the (perhaps questionable) decision to explore the floor a little more. After all, these places were usually full of loot, right? Getting out of here with some cash and items would be pretty nice if I ever made it to a town.

Soon enough, while wandering around the level, I eventually found something. A small glass bottle filled with some sort of liquid, sitting on the ground. I moved over and went to grab it- ah. Hm. I had nothing to put it in. And for that matter, no hands or hand equivalents to pick it up with. I really should have seen that coming. It looked like I wasn't going to be able to ==GET== anything until I found someone with limbs to help me.
```python
Get item: Max_Elixir ?
Y/N
```
More of that text floated in front of me - hovering next to the glass bottle.

`UH. YES.`

```python
Beginning digitisation.
Stand by. . .
```
I watched, utterly dumbfounded, as the bottle seemed to shrink and pixilate - before shooting straight towards me. I flinched in anicipation, squeezing my eyes tightly shut. There was a unpleasant feeling of pressure on my front, which quickly faded into nothing. Opening my eyes, I could see that the bottle had disappeared, replaced with more floating text under the first set.
```python
Digitisation complete.
Max_Elixir was sent to C:\Porygon\ItemStorage !
```
As the text blipped out of existence, I fixed my gaze on the spot the bottle had been sitting. I experimentally waggled a block-foot-thing through where it had been - it was certainly gone.

`WHAT WAS THAT. WHAT WAS ANY OF THAT. AUGH. WHAT IS MY LIFE.`
