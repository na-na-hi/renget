###->Hello, World!<-

This dream was different to my usual, half remembered ones. Contrasting to fantastical environments and nonsensical situations, this one was nothing but slowly scrolling text on a black background.
In the back of my mind, there was a slight recognition that I oughtn't be able to read in a dream, yet I could parse the words in front of me perfectly.

Hello, World!

```
A cool breeze swept across my body, pulling me from my unconscious state and pushing away the last bits and pieces of the dream that I had been having into the inky blackness. As my mind slowly crawled into a state resembling awake, it eventually came to the conclusion that something was very wrong. I generally made it a habit to avoid sleeping on the floor - especially *dirt* ones.

My eyes flew open, and I beheld the scene that met me. Sunlight broke through the loose leaf cover of the canopy above me, making small pools of light on the dirt and leaf strewn floor. I attempted to push myself off the floor, to no avail. Looking down - instead of the human body I was expecting,  a bright pink and blue mess of geometric angles greeted me - a surprise to say the least.

In the back of my mind, a spark of recollection fired off. It looked very much like I was in the body of a Porygon. It seemed that despite our long relationship, reality had given up and left - leaving me in a forest as a Pokémon.

`THIS MUST BE A DREAM.`

The sound of my voice shocked me. Staccato, scratchy and monotone, as if a bad recording was being played through 30 year old speakers, barely recognizable as my own. Still, my voice sounding strange was the least of my worries. I'd woken up in an unfamiliar place, and I was quite literally a sitting polygonal duck, splayed out across the cold, hard ground.

Lying around seemed like a bad idea no matter where I was. I pushed my doubts about reality aside and postponed my impending existential crisis - instead redoubling my efforts to try and move my new body.

***

A little while later, attempting to move my body seemed a futile endeavour. All I could seem to do was waggle the blocks that could be generously called feet, which was getting me nowhere fast. I wracked my brain. How did this body move? As best as I could recall about Porygon, they just sorta floated about the place. How was I meant to get that to work?

I glared at a nearby tree I had set myself the task of getting to. This was insane - whatever or whoever turned me into a Pokémon couldn't be bothered to let me to know how to move? It wasn't even that hard of a thing to want to do! I just wanted to ==MOVE== to that tree!
```python
Destination set.
Beginning pathfinding. . .
Route found; moving.
```
I saw the words pop up in the corner of my vision. A faint green line seemed to extend from my centre, the other end inside the tree.
My body picked itself up from the ground, and floated towards the tree. As I reached the point I had been looking at, I began to hover in place.

`OH WHAT FRESH HELL IS THIS. I DON'T EVEN HAVE DIRECT CONTROL OVER MY OWN MOVEMENTS.`

Idly floating next to a tree, I looked towards a different tree a little ways away, and concentrated on moving there.
My body complied, hovering over to the other tree, automatically moving around the rocks and trees along the path.
Well, it seemed like I had figured out moving around at the very least. I wasn't going to be a sitting duck if somebody picked a fight with me - although it wouldn't be too difficult to catch up with my leisurely pace, and I had no doubts about being unable to defend myself from attacks.

I kept at it for a little while, moving between trees and rocks, experimenting with how my movement worked. Thankfully, it looked like the 'commands' - for lack of a better word - were fully interruptible. I won't have to worry about hovering off in a direction I didn't mean to go in. A while later - after making sure I had a little more experience with moving around - the sky had begun to turn dark. Being alone in the woods after the sun had gone down seemed like a bad idea - I had no idea what the natural predator of the Porygon is, and I had very little desire to find out.

Trouble was, I had no clue whatsoever where I was. I could be anywhere - I didn't seem to come with any sort of map system built-in, sadly. Still, anywhere would probably be better than a random clearing in the forest at night. There was no sign of any path leading in any direction - so I did the next best thing. Choosing a random direction, I struck out, hoping that I would stumble across any sign of civilisation.

***

I was utterly lost. Wandering through the forest in a single direction was getting me nowhere - all the trees, rocks and small clearings had started to blend together into identical areas with no land marks. And to make matters worse, night had fully fallen, shrouding the whole area in an eerie darkness - only the full moon gave off any semblance of light. Actually - as I looked a bit closer at the night sky, I was struck with the uneasy feeling of something being wrong. Of the stellar objects that I could see, I recognised none of them.

`I CAN SCRATCH OUT THAT HOPE OF STILL BEING HOME. I GUESS.`

At least I'd managed to not stumbled into anyone in the darkness. I had the feeling that if anyone with even a single working eye was nearby, I would've been spotted instantly - I stood out like a sore thumb in the woodland environment; pink and blue were never the best colours for camouflage.

I hovered silently over the forest floor, listening out for any noises that could be another creature. Thankfully, it seemed that none of whatever denizens lurked here were nocturnal, as the only sound I could hear was the wind rustling through leaves and the soft creak of branches swaying. I figured that I'd lucked out - however long this journey took, at least it was so far uneventful.

Perhaps thinking that jinxed me - as the next clearing I came up had what appeared to be a set of stairs slap bang in the centre. Another memory flickered into the back of my mind. Mystery Dungeons. Areas of the world that had been affected by an odd phenomena, causing strange effects within an localised area - with the only way out being to get to the end. 

Pausing, I shook my head to clear my thoughts. Where had that come from?

Still - I had a basic understanding of how these dungeons worked (*How* did you know that? a quiet voice in my mind asked). Manoeuvring myself closer to the incongruous masonry work, I got a much better look at them - perfectly made stone steps leading down, with the bottom shrouded in darkness. Looking at them, I knew that I wasn't getting out of here without reaching the deepest part of this forest.

***

For a Mystery Dungeon, it was surprisingly empty. I'd not seen a single Pokémon while I had been floating my way through the level to the next staircase. Weren't these places supposed to be swarming with feral beasties attempting to beat the snot out of you? Not that I was complaining - if I could see the day out without encountering a Pokémon trying to kill me, I'd score that as a win.

Figuring that this was one of the safer dungeons, I made the (perhaps questionable) decision to explore the floor a little more. After all, these places were usually full of loot, right? Getting out of here with some cash and items would be pretty nice if I ever made it to a town.

Soon enough, while wandering around the level, I eventually found something. A small glass bottle filled with some sort of liquid, sitting on the ground. I moved over and went to grab it- ah. Hm. I had nothing to put it in. And for that matter, no hands or hand equivalents to pick it up with. I really should have seen that coming. It looked like I wasn't going to be able to ==GET== anything until I found someone with limbs to help me.
```python
Get item: Max_Elixir ?
Y/N
```
More of that text floated in front of me - hovering next to the glass bottle.

`UH. YES.`

```python
Beginning digitisation.
Stand by. . .
```
I watched, utterly dumbfounded, as the bottle seemed to shrink and pixilate - before shooting straight towards me. I flinched in anticipation, squeezing my eyes tightly shut. There was a unpleasant feeling of pressure on my front, which quickly faded into nothing. Opening my eyes, I could see that the bottle had completely vanished from my sight, replaced with more floating text under the first set.
```python
Digitisation complete.
Max_Elixir was sent to C:\Porygon\ItemStorage !
```
As the text blipped out of existence, I fixed my gaze on the spot where the bottle had been sitting. I experimentally waggled a block-foot-thing through where the Max Elixir had been - it was certainly gone, and from the sounds of things, I'd stored it. Somewhere.

`WHAT WAS THAT. WHAT WAS ANY OF THAT. AUGH. WHAT IS MY LIFE.`

While thoroughly disturbed by the whole experience of... whatever the hell that was, at least I knew that I could collect items. Didn't have any clue on how many, or how I get them back out of myself, but that would be a problem that I would have to figure out in the future.

***

I continued to explore the dense forest, continuing down another couple of floors. The last set of stairs had led me into a large, grassy clearing - the "walls" of thickly packed trees and plants parting, their canopy of leaves and branches pulling back enough to reveal the night sky in all its glory. The full moon shone brightly, illuminating the empty glade with a silvery light. I hovered over to the centre, my lack of footsteps preserving the absolute silence of the clearing.

Surveying the area around me, it was evident that there was no path forwards - there was no doubt that this was the deepest part of the Dungeon. Was leaving it going to be as simple as turning around and walking out? I could see that there was a smaller passage snaking out into the darkness, starting from where I had entered the clearing.

Turning to leave, I paused for a moment. 

All alone in this empty, silent clearing - the gravity of the whole situation I was in hit me. I had been dragged from my old life, transformed into another being, and left all by my self in a strange place. In the back of my mind, a nagging feeling told me that this must have all been for a purpose. Would I be sent back after (*if*) whatever my purpose is was fulfilled - and if so, how long would that take? Would I be put back exactly when I left? Or would I poof back into existence right where I was after being missing for who knows how long? What would I tell people? "Sorry I've been away for a few weeks/months/years, I'd been transported to another dimension"? I had the sinking feel that such an excuse would not go down well.

Or I might fail whatever it was I was brought here to do. I'd never get sent back. Nobody would ever know where I went - one night I just dropped off the face of the earth, never to be seen again. I couldn't bear think as to what my family would go through. Could they would every truly accept that I just *disappeared*? Would they give up on hoping that I'd ever come home? While it was perhaps selfish thought, I hoped they wouldn't. That'd they would think I wouldn't have *chosen* to up and leave without a trace, never to return.

I glanced up at the unfamiliar night sky. Why me? Was it random chance - did the cosmos align and cause me to slip through some gap in reality? Was this a cross-dimensional kidnapping was ordained by someone, and if so, what was going through their head to pick me out of all the others to rip out of my world and send me to another?

This barrage of questions I posed to myself hung there in my mind, unanswered. It was more than likely they would be unanswerable entirely.

Letting out a sound that *could* have been a sigh - had it not come from ancient sounding speakers - I turned back to the path. Whatever the reason I had been brought here was, be it random chance or providence, sitting around moping in a clearing at the bottom of a dungeon wouldn't help. I shoved those thoughts to the back of my mind, and pressed onwards.

By the time I had left the dungeon, light had just begun to outline the mountains in the distance. The faintest rays of light caught the tops of the trees as dawn broke across the landscape, slowly illuminating the land and pushing back the darkness. As I made my way out from the treeline, I took a look around using the new morning light. In the distance, maybe two hundred yards away from the Mystery Dungeon's exit, was what looked like a dirt path, winding off through the woods.

`OH. YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN HELPFUL TO FIND LAST NIGHT. OR AT ANY POINT YESTERDAY ACTUALLY.`

Idle sarcastic comments to the air aside, I was incredibly relieved to find a sign of civilisation. Paths don't just spring out of thin air - roads had to go somewhere, or come from someplace. Sure, this one might look barely travelled, but at this point any trail would be better than blindly stumbling through a forest. Adding to that fact, it would - hopefully - be unlikely that I would stumble into another Mystery Dungeon while on a footpath. All in all, it was a simple decision to attempt to follow the track to its terminus.

***

Travelling along the road was safe and quiet, if a little tedious. It had wound its way out of the forest a while ago, and I was now hovering through scenic countryside. Grassy rolling hills to my left and right soaked up the midday sun as I silently bobbed my way onwards - I was rather glad that my method of movement was... unconventional. The prospect of hiking across the countryside for a couple of days on end - without supplies - would have been challenge. Now, with only the worry of making sure I had set the destination to the end of the visible path, travelling was a breeze, allowing my focus to drift and my thoughts to wander.

In this case, my thoughts centred on my biology. Or, rather, my lack of it. By my best guess, it had been near enough two days now since I awoke in the forest. I'd been on the go since then, and not felt the slightest pang of hunger nor the call of sleep. It was concerning realisation - while it made my travelling much easier (and would no doubt save a bundle on provisions in the future), it hammered home just how much I had changed. I'd unwillingly made the leap from a biological body to a digital one, with all the philosophical quandaries that came with it.

Was I alive?

Or was my mind just a collection of wires and code that had been deluded into thinking? Was that any different than being a flesh-and-blood being, driven by electrical pulses through a brain? What did it mean to be *alive*?

In the back of my mind, a phrase pushed itself into the forefront of my mind.

*Cogito, ergo sum*. 

I think, therefore I am. The fact I was able to question if I was alive proved that I was. This was fairly basic philosophy, but even the fact that I had remembered it helped quell a little of my existential fears nonetheless. At least, it was enough for me to put a pin my ennui for the time being, and shift my focus back to the road.

I wasn't sure just how long I had been stuck in a funk, but it seemed that it had been long enough that I was approaching civilisation. A town seemed to rise out of the ground, the buildings carved out of the trunks of massive trees, rope bridges crossing the gaps between them on the upper levels. Honestly, the place seemed like it would be an absolute nightmare to navigate.

Considering that all I had seen from the last two days here was the empty wilderness, however, it looked like paradise.

As I began floating my way towards the town, I noticed that another small text prompt had popped into existence in corner of my peripheral vision.

```python
Incoming transmission from UNIT/PRG2. Accept?
Y/N
```
I stopped in my tracks. Incoming transmission? The fact I was getting a strange communique before I even managed to get into town felt off. Something was definitely up, but my curiosity overtook my common sense as I accepted the transmission.

```python
>Y

```
The words faded from my sight, leaving me alone - hovering in place by the side of the road. The strange conversation with what I knew to be my evolved form certainly smacked of something important - in fact, they'd plainly told me that they needed my help. Unfortunately, they neglected to let me ask them to explain what the issue was- and as far as I could tell- there was no way to give them a call back to get more information out of them.

However, they *had* forwarded me a set of co-ordinates. While I didn't have a clue how this place was laid out, I could see the faint image of a marker overlaid on the landscape in the distance, a little ways out of the other side of the town. At the very least I could get a lay of the land while on my way to wherever this Porygon2 was - or where they claimed to be.

***
>(wip needs *drastic* editing)

Making my way through the trunks and across the bridges, I made mental notes of anyplace that might have been of importance in the town. A shop here, what looked to be an inn of sorts there - all of them with a large amount of different Pokémon milling about. This town was turning out to be quite was quite hub of activity. 

While I drew quite a few stares while making my way across town, it seemed like the Pokémon here thankfully weren't the type to confront a strange-looking newcomer heading through town. 

Porygon2's co-ordinates led me to one stumps that were dotted around the outside of the town itself. This one was one of the larger ones - if the windows that dotted the outside were any indication, this place was at the very least three stories tall, and a little wider than it was high. The wood looked fairly well-worn, a darker shade of green to the others I'd passed by, with another trunk seemingly merged into the side. 

Looking up at it, the whole building was a pretty imposing sight. Still, this was the only lead that I had, and probably my best bet to get any answers.

Skirting around the strange hole in the ground that lay outside the front door - while it was covered up by a grate of sorts, I didn't fancy testing how my hovering would work with a surface with big holes in - I moved up to the curtain that covered the front door. And pushed my way through.

I was met with the sight of what appeared to be a relatively large lobby. Two large boards dominated the room - posters and notes adorning them as they hung off a wall, presented as the most important thing there.

The room was totally devoid of life, however. From the sounds I could hear coming from one of the rooms that shot off from the lobby - arguing and eating, from what I could tell - I realised that I must have dropped in during the occupant's lunch break.

Glancing around, I could see the waypoint that Porygon2 had set for me was pointing up the spiral staircase that sat in the centre of the room. I lingered for a moment, waiting to see if anyone would come out and meet me in the lobby. After a couple of seconds had passed - with no signs of a welcome party - I made for the stairs, heading up to meet Porygon2.
