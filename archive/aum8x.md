LOFTER ART GUIDE

this is for the app only because it's what i've always used

planet icon is explore and it's where you'll find the search function. for EN livers their tags are all in english, you can look them up by name or ship. traditionally ship art/fic won't be tagged with the name of the character as well but i've noticed for nijiEN they tend to add all the tags

after you hit search it'll suggest tags for you, click on the one you want and you arrive at this page. i used shugur as an example. circled in red is newest on the left and then hottest on the right.

if you click hottest you can filter by
>all time
>today
>this week
>this month
i've circled those in this order

once you click into a post, if you click on the image and then the three dots on the top right, you can save the image by clicking on the option i circled in red. artists can choose to protect their images and not allow them to be saved. also, downloading an image from the app will leave a watermark on the bottom left. i've been told doing so from a browser doesn't, but i've never tried it myself.

lofter has a multitude of other features like collections and bookmarks but those get a bit complicated to navigate if you can't read chinese. accessing smut fics can get extremely convoluted because you can't post porn on any chinese social media, so you have to jump through hoops like joining a QQ group or finding mirrored images on weibo. if you're lucky they'll be posted on AO3 instead and you can MTL those. i think the weirdest shit i've done so far in order to read smut is run a bunch of animal onomatopoeia through a translator on wechat. at least it was easy
