Hello!, I want to talk about this game that was in a computer already installed, an old Apple, those that have a keyboard included, a customer asked me to move the information from that apple to a little more modern for the standards I guess, since the keys had been screwed and there was no replacement, and by that time that computer is not even for home use, pass data, files, photos and ect, but I noticed that there was a game inside, on a disk, the floppy port is not even useful so I tried to get the data on another old computer in my workshop, the only thing inside was a game called ''Ananke'' I opened it to see and it instantly took me to the menu, there were no graphics, it was text, it was text trying to form an image, I decided to close it and make a copy of this file and return the floppy along with its owner.
After that on a Saturday I decided to play the game, I decided to take pictures of it and then post the game and let people see its content, for the record I searched and searched and did not find any physical or registered games.
I opened the game in the same computer, you will see and hear my trip that I did in ''Ananke''.

I know that before in old games like ''ROGUE'' they used text as art and represent things, like that game they are making ''Dwarf Fortress'' although the art is well done for the time.
If you're wondering, I named myself Abraham Lincon in this game just for the fun of it.
Upon entering the name I was introduced to a text-based art, a normal basic face, ''Abraham Lincon, you will be controlling the entity called ''Oliver Lewis'''.

A face of a guy made in text appeared at that moment, I guess that was my face, well the face of Oliver.
There was only the text option ''start'' with ''Y/N'' and I typed ''yes'' when I started my adventure it was pretty straightforward.

The screen went completely black until an art that covered all my screen appeared instantly that made me recoil in fright, it was an eyeless deformity dressed in a poncho and hat that welcomed me after the presentation of my character, the name deformity fits because i still cant decipher his face.
???:''I present myself fearful Oliver, I am the Judge, I judge and observe, I come to give you a news, your destiny was written by the great Scribe but the great Scribe made a fatal mistake, your destiny had a beginning and an end but the end was not concrete, I was personally entrusted to warn you that you have 3 more days.''
Judge:''You can return to the earthly world.''
After that the art disappeared and the frames appeared, the game described me that I was in a pile of dead, a specific common grave, the game specified the corpses that were closest to me, three men with spiders, a woman and some children, I wrote to inspect this normal I would have survived a fever but it seems that the common grave of corpses was for something, I took the time to think and decided to inspect the grave, the pit would not be so big, the corpses would have occupied enough space to be able to climb out of the pit, I asked how my state was, I would say that I was on my back and barefoot, after that I left the pit, at that moment I did not think much about who was the ''Judge'' I was not interested sincerely I had already seen many role playing games where there is someone who introduces you or welcomes you to the adventure.
After the game was figured out I would say.
''When you get out of the common pit you will see your little village empty, as if it was stopped in time, there is no one or a being in your presence, the color of the pit fades every time you get out of it, when you get out.... what will you do?
I wrote down the locations that I can see with the naked eye, he told me a local bakery, an abandoned house or continue down the street.
I decided to go to the bakery for resources, when I entered the game it told me that inside it would be totally empty only crumbs, rats would be around the place but dead and the few that are alive would be resorting to cannibalism, out of curiosity I wrote a description of the building, in short a mud and stone chosa thatched roof, it would be in the middle ages or similar, Oliver would have survived the black plague apparently deduced that the situation would not be better and it would be better for me to leave there because if not I could get infected again, I decided to leave the village on my journey through the meadows I saw a castle in the distance I tried to access there but the game warned me that I come from a northern village, the village closest to the castle, most likely that there already know about the plague and most likely to kill me at first sight I wrote the action I decided to look over the horizon and saw a carriage approaching, I wrote put me in front of this and make signs, this would stop and the merchant would ask along with an art of his face.

Merchant:''What are you asking for? ''
I explained and I had to lie that my horse died when his leg broke in a puddle, the game told me that he saw me in a suspicious way. 
he said to me
Merchant:''"Unfortunately... No... my answer is No, you look horrible, even if what you say is true, as soon as people see you they will think you are condemned they gonna think that you have the plague 
and they will execute both of us, I cannot take that risk''.
I tried to implore him but he kept his posture and prepared to leave towards the castle.
I really needed a shelter at that moment, the village is full of corpses and it was a matter of time before the rats would eat me, I wouldn't last a day, sleeping in the open meant dying of a cold, it seems funny but at that time a cold was a sure way to die, any current disease that is easily cured with a pill or just taking the day off at this time means dying, at that time I wrote that my action is to look for something on the ground, just rocks, that's what I needed, I simply made the action to grab the biggest stone and throw the stone to the merchant this would fall and the horses would stop, I wrote go fast go to the back of the carriage and look for some object that would be useful to me.
There were only basic supplies like water and others but there would be a sword covered with some sheets, I grabbed that sword and prepared for combat.
The message that nothing happened would appear, I decided to inspect the carriage, the merchant would be on the floor trying to stand up, because of the proximity with the horses they would give him a mortal kick in the head, it was clear that the merchant would have died.
I took no notice and took possession of the carriage, I had new clothes and money, but I needed a roof over my head and a place to treat me, I would have to go to the castle. 
I went to the castle, the merchant didn't lie, they let me in so I wouldn't look like a vagabond, I spent the time there shopping and looking for lodging and an inn, I decided out of curiosity to see where the sun was, the game would say ''it's getting dark, it's almost two days away''.
I kept looking for my travecia to get an inn, I would have got it and I would go to rest there.
I put oliver to rest there
the game would show me a countdown ''2 days and 6 hours'', ''2 days and 5 hours'', because that would be the way it would be a countdown, if I didn't press any button he would continue sleeping I suppose, when I made him sleep his respective 8 hours, when he was almost done the game said the following message.
''There is a knock on your door.''
I woke up the character and grabbed the sword and told Oliver to say.
"Who's there?
The door bangs louder, the sound of armor shudders the similar scream of the merchant would sound calling us ''Thief!'' literally I am against the sword and the wall, I wrote the action to inspect the room and see if there is an exit other than the door.
the only option was the window, every time I took the time to write something the text appeared saying that they hit the port harder, it's as if the game was in real time, I decided to jump from the window as soon as I saw the text that the door opened, the game punished me by not specifying that I opened the window but I still destroyed it when I jumped.
Oliver would fall to the ground with several scratches from the impact and the fall, the game details how the passersby look at me and move away when they see that I am armed, I decided to quickly run to the front towards the nearest curve to be able to lose those medieval armored guards, this sword will not work miracles, I inspected the area, the game detailed a possible exit a sewer I would try to go there and run as much as I could, I repeated the action several times until the game stopped and said that I was exhausted.
''The stench of death is near, slow and steady footsteps sound behind you in the distance''.
I softened my sword ready for the fight.
''The darkness of the Sewer does not allow you to distinguish its form, but as you get closer your eyes can identify it.''

Judge:''You're stupid Oliver''
Judge:''You ran and ran''
Judge:''The more you ran the more the pain spread, because of the adredaline you don't notice it but...''
Judge:''When you jumped out of that window pieces of wood are in your body and you have one especially in your leg near the thigh.''
Judge:''The effort has destroyed your muscle, Oliver, you can't run anymore, even if you wanted to, you are already exhausted.''
Judge:''You could have easily died in this little sewer but you have shortened your destiny.''
Judge:''the scribe has already written the verdict of your fate.''
I tried to attack him but the game did not allow me to do so.
While I was doing my actions metallic footsteps were getting closer and closer, they would have followed the blood trail.
They would have looked like medieval armored soldiers, I just wrote that I threw my sword and surrendered, a knight simply hit me with his sword specifically the part of the pommel and the countdown.
''2 days and 5 hours'', ''2 days and 4 hours''.
It would be clear that I would be unconscious only two hours would have passed until the character wakes up.
''You have a bag over your head, a crowd of people is murmuring.''
"Someone forces you to get up.
''Someone pulls the bag off your head.''
''You would be face to face with your executioner''.

anonymous executioner:''Any prayers before being judged?''
It took me a long time to write before, I tried to make a text lying that I am innocent but the text appeared.
''The executioner put the noose around your neck, he got tired of waiting for you.''
''A moderately well-dressed person with a handkerchief covering his mouth approaches you''.
https://files.catbox.moe/lrmwe8.png
???:''You have been accused of breaking the commandments, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not lie and you almost broke the sacred commandment to NOT KILL, but it's the attempt that counts, may God judge you.''
I wrote that oliver tried to struggle but it would be in vain the executioner would pull the lever choking oliver's neck, the play details horribly of how Oliver gets short of breath, How your vocal cords break and your neck starts to creak as he tries to hold your dead weight.
You see in the audience the judge, everything goes black, everything goes dark except him.
The only thing the judge said was: ....
Judge:"Your destiny...
Judge:"has always been to die...
Judge:"HANGED....''
