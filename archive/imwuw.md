##Clara (lucario)
##-> Lawful/neutral ->
- Clara was born as a riolu in a pack of lucarios (not savages, but also not the most civilized)
- Her mother was the lowest ranked member of the pack, & so they both were constantly harrased and bullied by the others
- One day in a moment of weakness, she tried to escape, but was unfortunate enough to step right into where a human would be isekai'd
   - She became enveloped in light, and the 2 souls merged into 1 body, Clara's body
- Had to learn how to take care of herself after she was banished for lashing out
- Keeps an stoic facade to hide the fact that she's very akward and a very bad socializer
- Doesn't understand the nieches of communication, like subtlety or double meaning, sometimes coming off as blunt or rude
- Some days, she doubts if the voice she hears is really a human or her just becoming insane
- She's the one that named the human "Smoke"
- Having to feed *way* more EXP than normal to her 2-souls-body, she spent half her life training just to keep up with others
- Every time she gets to relax is a blessing for her
- Hates people who manipulate or beat down on others
- Deep down, fears losing those close to her
- Self teaching aura expresser and fighter

##Smoke (human soul)
##-> Neutral/Evil ->
- Came from another world, has some form of amnesia since he doesn't remember his name (or any kind of name from his past life, or how humans used to look)
- His first conscious days were spent being dragged around against his will, watching through Clara's eyes, trapped inside her body
- Took weeks for him to learn how to speak, and months until he could move on his own
  - They don't talk through telepathy, they have to physically say whatever they want the other to hear (though only one of them can be heard by others)
- His presence can be felt by a feeling of creepyness and uneasiness coming from dark places in a room or shadows. Lots of light (natural or artificial) mitigate this effect
- If a room is already dark, he suffocates any lightsource he's near, rendering them quite weak, if not outright useless
- Rather lonely, since only Clara can see or hear him. He can't touch or feel things normally (only through Clara)
- Incredibly bitter at the world (for his predicament) & hardly trusts other pokemons.
- Can help Clara by using a move at the same time as her, or help her control her aura, or scout ahead as an invisible ghost spy (range of a couple dozen meters). Mistery dungeons heavily restrict this last technique
- Fears that one day Clara will wake up and he'll dissapear, or that he'll wake up in Clara's place
- Self teaching aura senser
