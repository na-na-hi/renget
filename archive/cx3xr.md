#Avalanche lookout
>Your monthly food supply is running thin and you aren’t expecting a resupply for another week.
>Couldn’t hurt to call HQ for an early delivery.
>Sitting up and looking around the 64 square foot room.
>Not a lot of space accounting for the bed, a desk, a small fridge, and a wardrobe separated by a short countertop with the only storage being underneath it.
>Things wouldn't be so cramped if not for the centerpiece, an Osborne fire finder.
>You’ve never even used the thing since you can eyeball the distance to any pillar of smoke in the valley.
>There's a message for you on your phone.
>You let it play while getting into uniform.
>”Anon, it’s April, we sent some supplies up early with a new volunteer. We’ve been a lot busier lately and figured you could use some help.”
>Great, a roommate.
>”I know it’s short notice but can you be down here at noon to pick her up?”
>Your heart skips a beat.
>Noon?
>According to your watch it is three in the afternoon.
>Ignoring the several other messages, you scramble into your uniform and run out the door.
>Walking down the sixty feet of stairs, you run through excuses.
>Fire scare?
>You’d be chewed out for not reporting.
>Troublesome teenagers?
>Nobody even walks this trail…
>No excuse is gonna do you any good.
>Reaching the ground you break into a jog.
>You’d like to be home before sundown, and you aren’t gonna be running back with forty pounds of food and toiletries.
>Rounding the corner around the public bathroom you’re stopped in your tracks.
>Standing before you is an anthro in a uniform identical to yours.
>You examine her reddish gray fur mottled with black stripes.
>Her uniform is tailored to prevent her bust from being crushed, but clearly not enough.
>A lynx based on her longer fur on her cheeks.
>Her blue eyes are squinted in a look of annoyance.
>On her back are two of the forty pound supply bags for the FLOs.
>Your thoughts are interrupted when the lynx speaks.
>”You must be Anon.”
>Break the tension, be cool.
>>“Yep, that’s my name, don’t w-”
>Your words are choked out by the weight of one of the cumbersome bags.
>Stumbling backwards you barely regain your footing.
>”Thanks for the help.”
>>“Sorry… I worked late last night.”
>”Good, you can take care of this for me.”
>She holds a piece of paper in your direction.
>Surely you can take care of some work for the newbie that brought more supplies for you.
>You accept it and she walks past you toward the lookout before stopping at the first step.
>”I’m Valerie, by the way.”
>Valerie turns and walks up the stairs to the tower.
>Returning to the paper, you find a short list.

>pick up trash from delta (north and south)
>check basin for visitors
>check falls for visitors

>All of it is clearly to get her familiar with the area.
>Heaving the bag of food over your shoulders, you start up the stairs.
>She should be cooled off by now, maybe you can convince her to come with you.
>Walking into the cabin of the tower you find Valerie face down on your bed.
>She’s taken the liberty of kicking her boots off and stripping into her undershirt as well.
>You throw your bag on the counter and prod at the lynx.
>>“Valerie!”
>No response.
>Groaning, you turn to look out of the windows.
>Admiring the blue sky and green trees.
>You hear the lynx, breathing deep and slow.
>You smell her musk, not quite unpleasant, but new.
>You need air.
>The northern delta isn’t far, five minutes maybe.
>It’s a very popular spot for photos.
>Many people don’t bother going to the other side as they already walked 2 miles from the campgrounds.
>Sometimes people will try for your blessing to camp out there, but you aren’t going to take a strike from HQ for them.
>Approaching the delta you see no trash whatsoever.
>People who are willing to walk this far are better than that.
>What you do see isn’t on the ground, but in the sky.
>A small thin column of smoke.
>A campfire.
>Maybe twenty feet past the treeline.
>Walking into the treeline you step through the foliage for a short while before breaking into a clearing.
>Two tents with a small campfire in the middle.
>Taking one last sip from  your water bladder, you extinguish the still smoldering core of the fire pit with what's left.
>Looking around you don’t see the owners anywhere.
>Tents, bags, open food, but no people.
>Taking note of this, you leave.
