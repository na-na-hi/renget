### Fixers:
>Mirra the Executioner
This one has great capacity but it cuts to many ways, felling friend & foe alike in the end. An interesting path of crisscrossing choices, always returning back to the inevitable choice to play executioner once again, ultimately choosing to keep themselves from being on the block. This of course only delays the inevitable, not diverting that ever approaching moment when the disastrous blade finally falls. 
Don't run from the End Embrace It. 

>Ji Jeong-Hui
Another unfortunate *youth*, squandering his potential on fabricated fictions. Worse he doesn't even make an effort to apply himself to coming up with his own distractions. He'll wear that yoke till it drowns him.  Maybe his light will yet win out, become something to surpass his roots. 

>Shiina, the Black Cat (Color Fixer)
A shy killer of necessity with an overwhelming desire to be free. A relatable urge. She's smart enough to enjoy the simple things, & has shown the wisdom for when certain fights ought not to be picked.  Still has a spark of goodness despite all the cruelty, crumbling & distress the city lays at everyone's feet.  We hold a rare optimistic outlook for this one. 

>Alm Claude “Penumbra” Faith
A stubborn holdout, fighting to resist being changed by any & all external forces. Pinnacle in virtue, staying true to oneself, commendable; if not for the forces she must battle requiring her to be at the mercy of butcher corps, cutting away parts of herself in pursuit of power.
How much of herself has been traded or worn away after all these years?  Where does it all go?

>Mars Valentinus, the Scarlet Slaughter (Color Fixer)
A wonderful flurry of activity, cast in a perpetually drying haze, chasing after that simple & visceral Red. The storm is ferocious, the carnage seemingly just, but to what greater ends? At least he is unconcerned enough to enjoy himself. Gratefully he understands everything has it's place of the food web, eat or be eaten.  Imagine what other colors might be achieved with this intensity? 

>Casey Jones
A delightfully absurd existence that manages to shelter a soul under all that metal. Worn sharp by years of travel through danger & insanity, hopefully it hasn't left him to brittle to truly make something of himself with all that time now that the shackles have been cast off.  Wonderful acoustics even if they are clearly imperfect.  His appreciation & care for his feline friend speak to the potential for his future.  Perhaps he would also enjoy a spot of gardening.
Perhaps someday he might even believe again... 

>Natalie
Not much to say, given she has yet to track through many spores. Hopefully her tireless pursuit of an older legend won't keep her from achieving her own distinct narrative journey. Shameful, if history repeated once more.  She probably expects that We exist to be dismantled as a Threat. 
Perhaps that is true, perhaps she will truly come to see.   


### Syndicates:
>Ava, Lady Luck
A rare sort, here in this *fair* city. She doesn't just leverage her power for herself, but for the better of those around her. Admirable even, despite the illicit nature some tasks require, but every problem has its own solution after all.  Taking out the refuse is a tiresome business, it is good to know that others have such similar concerns. We wonder what kind of Tea she might enjoy... 

### Artificers:
>Milo, Back-of-a-Van Workshop
A precocious sort, but We applaud the ambition. His wide scale of activity is also quite industrious. Most of all his ability to connect, resonate fascinates Us most. Would he be open to working alongside Distortions? The stuff of dreams that might be realized... 

### Feathers:
>Wilfrid, W-Corp Enforcer
For one that sacrifices everything to sustain their lofty & inherited position they certainly take a lot of chances trying to recruit instead of purge.  
We will watch this hard climb or rapid descent with a morbid curiosity.

>Azrael, X-Corp Enforcer
Bucking the trend, for a feather to be this borderline rebellious & still successfully employed, remains fascinating. 
If they ever decide to break free or claim the zenith it will make for an interesting tale nonetheless. 

>Haneul Vierordt, W-Corp Enforcer
Her many acts of *charity* are remarkable, as is her desire to clean up District-23's most unsavory of practices. Perhaps a *certain* strain of fungiculture might prove the be missing link in her ambition's chain.  Unfortunately she's far to entangled upon that lofty & thorny vine of rule, that having any conversation seems unlikely. Even were it to be between two celestial representatives. 

#### Fellow Distortions:
>Emma, The Shadow Queen
Our; fellow wanderer in the darkness, Noble Peerage, Monarch of Light, clad in Distortions upon Distortions. 
Your lonely vigil need not always be so, where the darkness precedes so must the light follow. 
The bio-luminescence mycelial pathways are always open to a kindred soul.

>Funeral Rites, What Fun
Here is another who holds together a precarious balance, teetering on that final threshold. How far beyond do they truly see?
Softest edge, drawing the sharpest of scores.
Flowers freshly cut down, to only be offered in grief. 
One more life cast away after another & another. How many does it truly take?
Cut threads that will be woven but have yet not been spun? 

>Xibalba, Burning Man, Flayed One, Love & Hatred & Burning
Simplified in the exponentially extreme, depletion as its most brutal expression. 
What unforgiving momentum must be achieved for an end to arrive that might still satiate such reckless hatred, such fathomless love?
Does the future have or hold any promise of forgiveness, or will the reason to reduce continue to claim, as a Calamity.
