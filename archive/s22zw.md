##### `Winter Cuddles`
>it's cold as sin during the winter time. Waifur is built to handle it with her bountiful fur. As a human with hardly any body hair, you can barely stand it.
>it's time for bed, but when you head for bed, waifur is already laying there, and the covers are no where to be found.
>"Don't be ridiculous, hubby. You have all the warmth right here" she says, motioning to herself. "This soft, warm, and delicate fur is more soothing and comforting than even the finest covers."
>"As for pillows, well, I can think of two for you to rest your head on" she says, with a hint of a blush as she rests a hand on her well-endowed bosom.
>Can't argue with that now can you. You make your way to bed and lie on your back right next to her.
>She in turn sprawls over top of you, enveloping you from head to toe in immediate warmth and comfort, shutting out all previous feelings of frigidness.
>She hooks an arm under your head and pulls you in close, turning you into a human sized body pillow.
>As time passes by, she had since drifted off, occasionally giving tender and gentle licks to your face. She has you completely boxed in, with no means of leaving. But honestly, why would anyone want to leave?
>The cold has passed, your laying in the embrace of your lover, all topped off with loving licks to your face.
>If this is what winter may bring, then I wouldn't have it any other way.
