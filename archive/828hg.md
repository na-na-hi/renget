>Well, it's official
>I've been a married woman for the majority of my life
>Kami, it feels like a lifetime ago that I met that nice American exchange student who swept me off my feet
>Everyone says I look really good for my age
>I admit, I take a bit of pride in how strangers often get surprised to learn how old I am
>My oldest daughter's current boyfriend thought I was her sister when he first met me
>My husband likes to tease me
>He says I'm gonna be a silver vixen
>I always blush when he tells me that
>He still looks great too
>Somehow, he still has those washboard abs
>Yeah, he's got some gray
>But it just makes him look more distinguished
>Just the other day, at the store, I came back from talking to the butcher to see two girls half his age (if that) blatantly hitting on him
>I admit, I was a bit insecure
>He didn't see me, so I watched from behind him
>He told them he was married
>And they should go after guys their own age
>I never thought he would stray, of course
>I just wanted to see how he'd handle the situation
>"I'm back, honey" I say
>He turns
>"Oh, there you are"
>I see the girls' faces fall
>"Trophy wife", I hear one mutter contemptuously
>I see his face change
>He's calm, but clearly not happy
>Turns to them
>"Do you really think I married her just to stroke my ego? We've been together since high school."
>The girl who insulted me realizes she messed up
>"And she didn't marry me for money or status. She married me because she loves me as much as I love her. So be careful judging people you know nothing about."
>The girls leave, clearly chastised
>"Kids these days..." he sighs
>I walk up to his side and kiss him on the cheek
>"I don't know, you still know how to make me feel like a blushing schoolgirl."
>He smiles
>"And you... you make me feel like I'm twenty years younger."
>I blush
>"Guess that explains why you haven't had a midlife crisis."
>He laughs
>"Well, I'll never trade you in for a younger model."
