We are an Empire forgotten to time. From the glorious city of Antiocheia, we ruled an Empire that stretched from the Heavenly Sea to the Kizuna Sea. What is called Indeia by foreigners and barbarians is what we called Githantheion, Land of the Divines for those who do not speak our high tongue! But those days are long past, and we are simply the last remnants of true civilization on this blasted continent.

To our west, lies the pretenders, who claim our own glory as their own. They use our language, use our architecture, and the same cities we once prospered in! Even our namesake, Glorious Anitocheia itself, is the seat of one of the pretenders. Ayakkayolia and Synedoneia, both claim our right title and claim to be Autokrators of Githantheion and Ouranion! These barbarians however will never hold our throne! Many times, they have tried, sometimes together, to take our current home, but have failed! The Divines will always prevent them!

To our east, lies the degenerates, blasphemous and most depraved of all nations in the world. They call themselves "veeshojoi" but we know them simply as Akolastos, debauched to those who do not speak our high tongue. We can tolerate the eastern fools, for they at least try to respect the traditions of our former lands but to these, the worst of all barbarians, they have forsaken any morality, wisdom and honor for the vices of the world. They destroyed all of our legacy in their lands and replaced it with the wickedness of the flesh. The self-acclaimed "Champions of Freedom and Diversity" are neither in reality. Invaders, like all the rest of them; they came to plunder and mock our divines, our traditions and our way of life that has existed since the beginning of record history. But like the westerners, these degenerates have never been able to destroy us like they have wished and never will. They will fall like the rotten husk of a nation they are one day!

We do not forget our past, nor do we forget the true old and righteous states that exist. The memory of the Ailivian Empire and the Tsukinode Empire are fresh within our minds. The former's fragments have forgotten of us, but the latter hasn't, but doesn't treat us with the honor we deserve. But one day they will be reminded of our presence.


We, in the South, shall rise again! For according to legend, from the Great Leukos Mountains, a man shall be born that we know as the Megas Sotiras. He shall be a man from the Divines themselves, a man totally devoted to the ways of the divines and the *Prototype Tropos*. A man of immense skill in all things, from the Military to Theology; truly a blessed man. When he comes, we shall have our revenge on our neighbors finally. This day, we have long prayed and prepared for. Let no one say that our nation is dead and gone, for Ouranion lives and marches on!
