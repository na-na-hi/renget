#Kichōna Jutsu List
***

I doubt she would say any of these but it's fun to make names for them like how they would be in the Storm games.

##Weapon Art + Machina Ex

Kichōna has several main weapons she uses.

>Metal Pin Puncture
She extends metal spikes through her skin. She can make long and spear-like ones, small ones that are like thorns, or both at once. Small ones are used for grappling and defense, while the long one is used for stabbing and parrying.

>Metal Tail Vein
She extends flexible metal tubes through her skin. They can be used as ropes or for grappling, but she typically uses them as a base for other Jutsu.

>Metal Flash Sun
She extends a small cannon that can fire chakra blasts. Typically used at range, occasionally used when close.

Other weapons, like blades or shields, can be made as well. However, she just doesn't like them, and has Weapon Art expertise in using the above.

She typically extends multiple arms for use in combat, for a total of 6, but prefers not to make multiple faces or facial features unless needed. 

##Chakra Flow + Sound Style

>Pretend Lightning Surgeon: Puncture
A technique similar to the Chidori, and her strongest one that just uses chakra, she typically has to double her eyes before using it to better focus, which she doesn't like. She courses electricity through a long spike, and it can be swung like a sword to do a large amount of slashing damage. She also needs to have one arm be the spike, while another arm grabs it and produces electricity. Self-taught, copied from watching Osamu.

>Pretend Lightning Surgeon: Vein
Extending metal tubes, she electrifies them, and then uses them like a net. Wide range, but not particularly powerful. Built off of the Puncture variation to hit faster opponents. Uses a small amount of chakra.

>Crying Whale
She forms a speaker in her hand, and then focuses chakra into it. Upon making contact with the opponent, she unleashes a burst of sound, focused on causing a large amount of internal damage. High risk, high reward. Not her technique with the most raw power, but can do more damage than all except one. Typically uses Body Flicker to get in close range for this. Uses a large amount of chakra.

>Shrieking Whale
Forming speakers in all hands, she lets loose a wave of sound in all directions. She can try and hit everyone around her, or just try and keep in a cone. Uses a large amount of chakra.

>Crying Leech
Similar to the previous techniques, she instead forms small speakers in metallic tubes, and attemps to attach the tubes to the opponent. Then she lets a large amount of sound through the speakers. Focused on causing internal damage, but safer due to higher range. Still not particularly powerful. Osamu came up with it. Uses a small amount of chakra.

##Homonculi Clay

>Storm Doll
The typical shape her Dolls' take is bulbous and uneven, reminiscent of poorly drawn clouds, but then with limbs. Pear-shaped, with small black eyes on the skinniest point. They are all weak to Air Release techniques, which causes the Lightning that gives them power to dissipate. She typically carries clay in hidden compartments on her arms and legs. These techniques typically use less chakra than her others due to cutting into her clay resource, which she needs to restock after use.

>Storm Doll: Crackle
Small Dolls that look like clouds with bird wings. Focused on homing and harassing opponents, and then converting into harmful electricity. Uses a small amount of clay and chakra.

>Storm Doll: Rumble
Similar to the above, they instead detonate into sound. Can be used to pass on short messages, as they do little to no damage; they can only disorient at worst. The messages come out in a strange, high pitched voice, which Kichōna enjoys. Uses a small amount of clay and chakra.

>Storm Doll: Windy
A large Doll with either wings or four crab-like legs, used for movement. Has holes on the sides that can release smaller versions of itself, that convert themselves into electricty to do damage. Kichōna enjoys riding on it, and it can support one other person. Uses a large amount of clay, but a medium amount of chakra.

>Storm Doll: Pour
A large, limbless Doll that Kichōna throws at the opponent. Upon landing, it loses shape and collapses like a snowman. It then converts into electricity. Inspired by Nodao's Lava Release. Uses a large amount of clay and chakra.

>Storm Doll: Gloom
Extending out air-tight metal tubes, she attaches them to an opponent if possible, and removes the air from them. She sends incredibly tiny Dolls through that attack the surface the tubes are attached to. If they can get into the bloodstream, they can cause a small amount of cellular damage, and paralysis in the area. This is designed to minimize the chance of them being affected by Air Release before their conversion into electricity. Inspired by Shimabukuro's Kidaichu. Uses a small amount of clay, but a large amount of chakra.

>Storm Doll: Mist
Kichōna sprays out tiny Dolls as a mist. They do damage to whatever surface they land on, or can be converted midair. Hard to see, even when converted, but they only do a low amount of damage. Can cause choking and slight paralysis if inhaled. Also inspired by Shimabukuro. Uses a small amount of clay, but a large amount of chakra.

>Storm Doll: Sunny Day
A technique Kichōna can only use when berserk, and uses all of her clay and chakra. Forming a large, hollow Doll with an opening on the back, and a net of lightning inside, she shoots a Machina Ex chakra blast inside. The blast mixes with the electricity of the net and Doll, shrinking to a point, and then creating a large explosion.

#Osamu Jutsu List - Bonus

>Criminal Style: Puppet Gang Up
All available combat Puppets in the area where this is used will try their hardest to attack the target. Osamu invented this technique during his youth as a scientist (at 19), where he and a bunch of his peers beat the tar out of some rival scientist while wearing masks because he slighted them. The Ame science scene is hardcore. Osamu can never show his face there again after some of what he pulled. Osamu's not even his real name, actually.
