- Adanas / (Kevin Meier)
One of the three major 'troublemakers' on the dev team for the largest portion of the games post-release history, and now ex-Game Designer (or as he put it, *Master of Balance*, unaware of the irony) for Paladins (leaving for Valorant Character Design in May 2021). OVersaw an extremely unpopular reign; including (but not limited to) quite obvious favoritism, the removal of 3rd Person and the horrendous 'rework' of VGS. Often saw in odd costumes, such as a frog onesie, a tiger-man hat + makeup and a pirate costume.
 - Alice #2
One of the *good ones*, outsourced artist generally seen to be the best artist working on Paladins and brought in to work on occasional splash arts. Responsible for Io's and Mernos Jeno's card arts. Is named Alice #2, as she became known after Alice #1 (RaeveOfBladez), a somewhat odd, but well known and long-term Paladins fan artist.
 - Alyssa
*Tell me lies, tell me lies, tell me sweet little lies*. Ex-Community Manager, would lie constantly
 - (Thomas) Cheung
 Purple-headed Asian pedophile and ex-Community Manager at the LoRez Offices. Busted in 2019.
 - Drybear
 - Erez (Goren)
One of the two founders of LoRez, generally seen the ex- top dog of LoRez and known based autist.
Clearly knows what he's doing - as he founded Radiant Systems in 1985 - a Point-of-Sale development (shopping till) company in the hospitality sector. 7 years later it was a $1m corp, 7 years again it was a $130m corp. Erez left in 2004 with multiple awards under his belt, including more Microsoft Retail Application Development Awards than any other person in history (and after him leaving, in 2011 Radiant Systems was acquired for $1.2b). After leaving, with a seemingly large posse of lackeys from Radiant, founded LoRez in 2005 - and the rest is history.
Is often pointed to as a case study 
Leddit hates him with an absolute passion, and blacklisted from the entire site after one such leddit janny rulesfagged him out of existence (*can't use upboats to gauge community response on an AMA!*). They still seethe about him to this day.
Roughly in his 50's-60's now, retired and easily has enough money to retire to the Caribbean with enough blow and hookers to last him the rest of his natural lifetime. Member of the tribe.
 - (Thomas) Holt
Ex-Art Director for Paladins, for much of the Open Beta, from at least 2016 to 2018, passing over during a transitional period of Khan and Furia. Generally looked back upon with very high regard, especially compared to his *replacement*. Possibly left before being 'let go' / fired for links to the complete shitshow that was OB64 / Cards Unbound (take the current cards system, make the limit 50 Points instead of 15, and make it extremely grindy / P2W). Personally liked Sports and Dinosaurs, though it wasn't reflected in his direction (his pet lizards might have got in via Mal'Damba however)
Sells houses now, founded a housing company that does custom 3D modelled housebuilding for the more consumer sided market.

 - Martini
 - MasterMRL
Autistic ESL Twitter Furry Pedophile (or 'Cub' browser). Common within the thread. Despite all this, probably one of the best dataminers / modders etc the game has.
 - St. Terminus
He blesses us with bugs. Throughout the games history, has been consistently the most broken and buggy Champion in the game. There was once a point in 2018 when a dev was soley assigned to fixing Terminus bugs. In less than a week, he quit without as much a letter of resignation.
 - Stewart (Chisam)
Current CEO / Director of Lo-Rez, and general tard wrangler since January 2019. Hasn't got up to much trouble as of yet, likely got his role as a lackey of Erez, coming from RadiantSystems to LoRez with him.

 - Tribes: Ascend / Global Agenda
The two major games in LoRez's catalog that aren't around any more, and were killed almost as a result of mismanagement. Indicative of the fate that will befall the others.
Global Agenda was an MMORPG-Shooter (not too dissimilar to Planetside 2) and the first game on the LoRez catalog, which, while successful, was slated for a sequel. The sequel never came (with the unused assets and gameplay elements being repurposed into Paladins). Servers shut down in 2018.
Tribes: Ascend was a hugely popular and truly unique shooter that without-question held the title of 'Fastest Paced FPS in gaming history' (that established it's own genre of FPS-Z, named after the Z-axis you'd naturally be flinging up and down on), and can be best described as a cross between CSGO Surf, Quake, Sniper Elite and Sonic the Hedgehog playing Capture the Flag, with teamwork most resembling that of fighter jet formations. Every weapon in the game was projectile based, every class in the game had gravity-based 'skiing' movement, with the result being a game which both rewarded high mobility skill (for the surfers who would perfect build up momentum for about a minute to approach light speed to steal a flag) but also gave rise to huge trickshots plays (as a sniper's bullet would quickly chase the plucky thief) - or memes like a Juggernaut (living wall) artfully positioning themselves so a lightseed Thief would \*splat\* into them. As it began to pick up steam in 2012, it was completely abandoned in late 2013 as LoRez chased their other projects (at the time, SMITE and Paladins in their infancy) - after such amazing ideas as putting a harsh cap on top speed and removing a map from the game *as punishment* for not liking it's rework. 3 years later, LoRez returned to it for a few patches; where they went out of their way to destroy everybody's personal account progress and revert all purchases in good intent, driving a final nail into it's coffin. To this day, the servers are still 'online' with a small bastion of an oldguard (some probably being some of /ours/, given it's huge popularity on imageboards during it's peak), but the game is functionally dead, and you won't be seeing it go opensauce any time soon unless it gets hacked, given LoRez's signature greed. RIP
 - Thunderbrush
One of the three major 'troublemakers' on the dev team for the largest portion of the games post-release history, the current Art Director for the game, since a handover phase during Khan and Furia (look at their default splash art to get an idea). Generally very talented at high quality sketches, metal sheen and  - however struggles more with facial proportions and non-metallic / matte occlusive lighting (tl;dr cloth light reflection)
Seems to have extremely disproprtionate sway in the team for his role, with his fingers in the pies of 
Personally likes essentially every breed of Furry (Fur, Scale, Feather and even Fish), Warhammer, Angels vs Demons (especially Demons), Corruption / Edge (especially spikes) and Ninjas (and maybe their known rival, Pirates) - and it heavily shows in the direction during his reign.
Despite all this, is somehow married.
