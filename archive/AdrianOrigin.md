#A New Life as an Umbreon

Day 1
 
Life had finally been going good for Adrian. He was finally going back to the gym, his job was working well, and he was expecting to hear from a recruiter at the police academy soon. Of course, all these good things couldn’t be happening without some cosmic force making all of his efforts in life totally pointless. This cosmic force finally showed its hand on the day that Adrian awoke in the middle of a forest in the middle of the afternoon.
 
Now, Adrian had gone camping before, but he usually remembered to bring some equipment with him. He also usually remembered planning the camping trip. This was certainly odd, but no matter. Probably a rough morning. His head was a little fuzzy. He just had to get up and figure out where exactly he was. Everything will start coming back surely, and he'll figure out what's going on.
 
It was at this precise moment, when trying to stand up on his two legs, that Adrian realized what was going on. He couldn’t balance himself on his two legs anymore, and he fell over spectacularly. He landed very hard on his tail before rolling on his back. He didn't realize what had really happened until he noticed that actually had a fucking tail to land on.
 
Now things made perfect sense. Waking up in the middle of nowhere, not remembering what had really happened, and his body wasn’t even his own. He was in the body of an umbreon. Yeah, he knew exactly what was going on.
 
“GOD FUCKING DAMMIT!” He shouted into the uncaring sky.
 
Day 2
 
Adrian spent the previous day figuring out how exactly to move as a quadruped. He also had the lovely experience of learning that he was now naturally nocturnal, meaning all of that effort he’d spent trying to fix his sleep schedule was worthless too. His frustration just continually grew. This might’ve been a dream come true for him during his childhood, but he hadn’t even played a Pokemon game in years. He’d grown out of that. He had responsibilities as an adult, and this stupid fantasy world was taking him away from that.
 
Had to focus on the present, though. Adrian’s second day of wandering through the woods did eventually yield some results. He managed to find a road, all while successfully evading any wild pokemon. He was, however, surviving entirely off of foraged apples which had started to rot since Adrian can't reach for fresh ones off of the trees. Those got sickening after a while. He also had no method of carrying stuff beyond holding things in his mouth, so he couldn't take any of the items he found with him.
 
Loneliness was starting to set in as well. He hadn’t seen anyone except the wild pokemon that he did his best to avoid and a traveling merchant he couldn’t buy anything from. He missed his family. He missed his friends. His simple job, and his warm bed. He didn’t value them as a human, but he desired them so much now.
 
Day 3
 
Waking up to the sight of the sun setting wasn’t the best feeling. Still, Adrian had to get up and get moving.
 
This was the day he finally stumbled on a small town, and finally figured out a game plan. There were small jobs posted on the board of this town that he could finish and get payment for. They mostly involved fetching lost toys that kids left in local mystery dungeons, or picking up some snot-nosed brat that ran away from home. He finally gathered enough money to feed himself, as well being able to afford a small satchel and a defense scarf.
 
He was also able to pick up a few skills in fighting as well. His umbreon form was starting to feel much more natural. While he was usually outnumbered and not very skilled, the wild pokemon were usually pretty stupid or too slow to catch him. Adrian also wasn’t taking bounties, so he wasn’t facing anything too high above his current grade.
 
Day 15
 
Adrian now had a pretty decent income and a small, but decent reputation with some of the local villages and towns. After spending some mornings in the local inns, he’d heard mention of a guild in a place called Capim Town that was hiring explorers. Apparently, the pokemon in this guild were a little odd though. Constantly made weird inside jokes, used words that only they understood. Still, this guild was offering more consistent work than local bulletin boards and bartenders.
 
Adrian pooled some of his money together, purchased some supplies for the road, and set out for Capim Town to find this strange guild.
 
Day 18
 
At last, Adrian had made his way to Capim town. These past few weeks had been so lonely for him. Hopefully here, he could get a little bit more revenue and maybe find a way back? It’s a long shot, but he’d do what it takes to get home.
 
Adrian asked around the town for any information, but kept getting odd looks from people whenever the guild was mentioned. Adrian was getting the vibe that people from the guild probably were as strange as the rumors were saying. Eventually, he was able to find the guild.
 
Upon entering the guild, there was a Meowstic already there, seemingly waiting for him.
 
“Welcome to the guild,” the Meowstic introduced himself. “My name is Lliam. What would your name be?” 
 
Lliam was the first human name Adrian had heard in almost three weeks. Hearing this, along with all the rumors about the odd behavior of the guild, he was able to put the pieces together relatively quickly.
 
“Excuse me, are you okay?” Lliam asked. Adrian had actually lost himself a bit in the revelation, and he was just standing there staring at him.
 
“Sorry, my name is Adrian. I just realized what’s going on with the guild here,” Adrian was about to explain.
 
“That most of us were humans? That hasn’t exactly been the best kept secret if we’re being honest with ourselves,” Lliam said.
 
“Oh…” Adrian felt kind of stupid.
 
“So… I imagine you’re here looking to join?” 
 
“Uh, yeah. I’ve been doing some small jobs in some of the nearby villages. I’ve gotten pretty decent at this whole ‘rescue’ gig.”
 
“Well that’s definitely more experience than most of the mons here when they joined. Glad to have you on board!” Lliam remarked to Adrian.
 
“Thanks, I guess,” Adrian replied. “So, what are the other people here like?”
 
Around that time, two pokemon behind Lliam started sprinting down the stairs, laughing while a third pokemon threw a glass bottle at them and sprinted towards them. He yelled “Get back here, you worthless faggots!”
 
“They’re… usually pretty chill people,” Lliam said while trying to keep a straight face.
 
This was gonna be a real fun time for Adrian.
