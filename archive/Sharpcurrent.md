### Sharp Current ♀
 An orphan abandoned to the wilds as a Sobble, she would not rise to the rank of Noble until much later in life when by chance she would come across a member of the nobility about to be ambushed while detouring through a dangerous trade route. Immediately seeing an opportunity and with seconds to spare, she intercepted the attack and struck down the would be assassin in one shot. So impressed and grateful for this she would be brought into the family and given some of the best training money could buy to serve as body guard until the day he would pass away and title of Noble pass on to her.
