#Sunny eat steak.

"Here you go, Sunshine!"

Mari's voice hit Sunny's ears - which was laced with happiness and excitement. Sunny's eyes sparkled as he looked upon the piece of meat. The brown skin, cooked to perfection. The small cut tomatoes and spices that laid on the steak made it look extra appetizing. Mari walked towards her little brother, a smile on her face as she did. Placing down the steak, the scent of heavenly food, entered Sunny's nose. Picking up the knife and fork, Sunny stabbed the steak to keep it in place. Using the knife, he cut off a piece, revealing the rare, pink meat inside. Sunny opened his mouth, and bit down on the tender slice of steak.

Sunny's eyes became wide with surprise as the juices hit his tongue. The flavor was amazing. Mari watched with a smile as Sunny chewed the small slice before swallowing. She couldn't be happier when she saw him quickly cutting off another slice and quickly shoved it in his mouth. Mari clapped her hands as she watched Sunny indulge himself in the heavenly meat. Sunny ate so fast, he was disappointed when he looked down at his plate and saw the steak was all gone.

"I'm glad you loved it, Sunshine!"

Came his sister's ecstatic voice.
