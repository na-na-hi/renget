Name: Red Queen Effect
At will can summon the Vorpal Blade, a translucent sword that treats all matter equally absurdly, including manton particles, allowing for it to cut through just about anything and deflect bullets real and imaginary.
[Revenant Blade+Deflect+Counter+Pain Inducement(Reduced)]
'The vorpal blade went snicker-snack! He left it dead, and with its head. He went galumphing back.' 


Summoning the sword summons the crown, which alters his perception, enhancing his sixth sense, as well as giving the reactions and speed necessary to keep up with anything within a 30 foot radius. It may also cause hallucinations.
[Peak Condition+Presence+Ultra Instinct+Powersight(Reduced)+Clearhead(Reduced)]
'Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place.'
-Someone original, probably

>Power Definement
Limits the effects to the blade and the crown, he can't counter anything with his hands or deflect bullets with his hands, and he doesn't have ST UI without the crown. Also limits his revenant blade shape to one thing.
The crown also coincidentally does causes halucinations. [The definement on clear mind is that it effects OTHER masters, not his own power which causes his hallucinations.]
After killing Butcher, he gains pain inducement [random on hit with sword] and Powersight [can see the veins and arteries of people he's cut when the crown is on, nothing to do with powers unfortunately]
This allows him to fight both with nonlethal and extremely lethal methods which I think fits the theme
I figure that power definement already worked with his build and I introduced a lore friendly way to rebalance some points.

>Vigilante Type
Ambivalent +4/+4

Alexi is a reclusive poetry student with a voice in his head that spurs him to go get into fights with other shard carriers. He turns out to be pretty good at it. Good enough to attract the attention of heroes and villains, which in turn leads to more fights. Tends to spend his time like many other liberal arts college students, doing psychedelics and pulling all-nighters with various chemical assistants.
Yes he is a jobber wearing a crown, that is the joke.
