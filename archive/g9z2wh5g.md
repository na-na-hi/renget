"Hm. My classmates haven’t seemed to notice me… good,” a white-haired girl spoke from the top of a tree, her speech a little better than the last time she spoke in class. She was hiding from the others… those people in the school.

She went to school, but hers was nothing like that; it was not that big, and it was not that crowded. It was a little daunting to stare at so many people, even when she hid on the top of a tree.

Kyoko cringed, holding her body tightly, almost curling into a ball as she stared at the cafeteria. The sight of it was enough to send chills up her spine and make her hungry. Normally, she would go to her hidden stash or use her tunnel to get into the teachers’ room and raid their fridge, but it was not an option now.

She had seen a ghost lurking in the teachers’ room last night. It was like the vengeful ghost that roamed the mountains. The ghost her mama and papa warned her about was in the school.

She was with a strange and evil snake person, a bigfoot like her mama, and people she failed to recognize. They were in the cafeteria too. “Screeeech…” Kyoko held her legs tight, feeling the fear seep into her mind, her fur standing up as her whole body became that of a bigfoot like her mama.

Shiketsu was scary. The big Insect classmate was nasty. The snake classmate was mean, and the legged snake classmate was strange. Shiketsu was too scary. She couldn’t go to her stash and eat. What if the ghost got her winter stash?

She was stressed. She curled into a ball and threw herself at the ground. Kyoko knew one thing: when in doubt, dig or eat. She couldn’t eat. ‘I need more tunnels to run away from the ghost.’ Her tunnel in the teachers’ room was compromised. It was time to make a new one.

Kyoko rolled her body at ludicrous speeds, using her ball form as a drill.
