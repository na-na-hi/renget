Unnamed Lui OneShot.

I felt my head getting lighter as my drink went down. An almost empty glass of whiskey stared back at me from the bar’s counter. Little bits of chatter and smooth jazz reververated across the room. I toyed with my glass, spinning it on it’s bottom, turning it from side to side, swirling the last bits of ice inside in an attempt to make time go by faster. I couldn’t stop feeling my phone inside my pocket, it felt incredibly heavy as a wave of anxiety kept washing over me. Finally, I decided to take it out to check the time, an excuse I made for myself. Ten forty-two. Thirty-two minutes late and no new messages.
I put it back in my pocket and asked for another drink. I didn’t touch my glass for a bit, waiting for something, anything. Then, I got a message.

“I wont be able to make it soz soz ;(“-D.

There it was. I got stood up. A faint smile brushed my face for a bit, at least, I got over the grief of thinking about my date not showing up, often, once the anixety of a bad omen climaxes into said omen, you’re glad it’s over.

Not much to do on a night like this one, I thought. I began drinking my whiskey once more, and before I knew it my glass was down to two ice cubes. My mind was floating around from thought to thought, chewing itself out in a mixture of pity, disappointment and a little bit of anger. Surely, she knew beforehand that she wouldn’t show up, so couldn’t she tell me earlier? Perhaps she had something more important come up, I shouldn’t pester her about it. As time went by I decided to check on her social media and saw a picture of her hanging out with other people, and with that, the last bit of my self-worth had been crushed.

I was lost looking at my hands, my empty glass, the space between my legs showing me the floor, how a piece of the bar’s table was chipped, how one of the floor tiles was misaligned. and other small details of my surroundings. I heard the sound of a running liquid, which snapped me back to reality.

My glass had been refilled by the barman, although I didn’t ask for it, before I could ask him what that was about, he tilted his head towards a lady sitting across the bar. Her eyes were a beautiful shade of blue and her hair was a rather elegant pink. She slid over to my side and I got a glimpse of her outfit, a plain office lady uniform, but it seemed like so much more on her, as if her clothes were enriched by her.

“Hey there” Said a friendly voice, which I had to process for a few seconds before I realized she was talking to me.

“Oh, h-hey” I managed to mumble out.

She held in her hand a glass of wine, and took small sips in between the awkward silence I had left.

“My name’s Lui.” She said.

“I’m anon, pleased to meet you.” I replied, trying to calm myself each bit.

“You were looking a bit sad, Anon, waiting for someone perhaps?” 

A spear pierced through my heart, bullseye. I took a sip of whiskey, and exhaled.

“I was, I got stood up” I said almost shamefully.

“I see” Lui said.

More and more people were around the establishment, the sound of footsteps, clanking glass, a few giggles and chatter here and there overtook the jazz that had been playing.

“Thanks for the drink, Lui” I said while drinking a bit of my whiskey. I had to be grateful to her in some way.

She giggled to herself for a minute, drank her wine and then turned to me.

“Don’t mention it anon, everyone needs a little something” She said leaning in closer to me.

My heart started beating fast, but I didn’t want to think anything funny. She was probably just being nice to me since I had been sulking all this time. 

“Besides, why should a young man like yourself worry about such trivial things? There’s plenty of fish in the sea, you know” Lui broke my train of though with her voice.

I felt something on my leg, all this time I didn’t notice Lui’s hand slowly going up my thigh, maybe because of the alcohol, the atmosphere, the shock of seeing such a beautiful lady take interest in me.

Lui didn’t say a word, while her hand gently gripped my inner thigh, making her way closer and closer to my crotch. I felt shivers down my spine just as I felt my body burst into flames. I heard her whisper something into my ear. I’m not sure what. All I know is that after that I downed the last bit of my whiskey and we left the bar. She called a cab and I felt dizzy. We got in the backseat and she started kissing me all over. It was a fleeting moment, it flashed before my eyes like the streetlights shinning through the taxi’s window, shortly revealing the woman whom I was with, then sinking her image back into the shadows of the night, she was as visible as light allowed her to be, but she made sure made sure I wouldn’t find myself alone in the dark. We stopped at a hotel and took the elevator to her room.

Once inside, she pushed me onto the bed, took her shoes off and got on top of me, unbuttoning my shirt, biting my neck, as I ran my hands up and down her back, not very sure what to do.

I felt like my chest was gonna burst, how was I supposed to tell her that I…?

“Lui!” I called in the midst of passion.

“Hm?” I heard in confusion, probably wondering why I stopped her.

I couldn’t find the strength to say it out loud, so I went around it.

“I-I’m just starting out, ok?”

My heart sank, feeling as if I had just put myself out for shame. I felt I should’ve just shut up and go with the flow, but then again, I would’ve come up short. I felt as if I had killed the mood and Lui would back down.

Or so I thought.

Looking up at the woman on top of me, her expression shifted. Short, hot breaths escaped her mouth rhythmically, and her once calm blue eyes, shined with lust.

“Oh Anon, don’t worry” She said almost to herself, before coming up close to my ear and gently biting it.

“You just lay down, and let me do the work”


My vision shifted from her eyes to her breasts, she drew her hands behind her back and undid her bra, letting her breasts hang down. She took my wrists in her hand and slowly guided them to her chest, I took some initiative and gently grabbed them, squeezing them and rubbing her soft, pink nipples. Her breasts soft, her skin inmaculate, Lui was a Goddess who decided to play with a mortal.

Lui smiled at me with joy. I kept playing with her tits while she took off her skirt, revealing to me her bare legs and some sexy black underwear. She took my hands again and left them on her buttocks, soft like a bubble, yet so firm. I didn’t notice when she undid my belt and took down my pants, she then stared at me playfully, and began grinding on top of my dick.

I was squirming with pleasure, and all she could do was look at me, smiling and giggling all the while.

I felt her hand under my boxers, I raised my hips a little bit and she took them off. On my bare crotch, I felt something hot and wet. Lui kept grinding on top of me, lubing my dick with her love juices. She grabbed my erect penis with one hand and slowly rubbed it, I watched as she lined it up with her slit and took me in. I let out a moan, followed by another one. Lui came down to my face and gave me a deep kiss, drowning out my sounds.
She squeezed me hard with her warm, wet insides, I felt her swinging her hips in a circular motion as she took me all the way in, the way my penis scraped her walls was driving me insane. She gave me a soft kiss on the nose and got down from me and put herself on all fours before me. She spread her pussy lips open and looked from under her own body. Her expression was inviting me to take her, and I did so.

I grabbed her plump ass with both of my hands and tried to put my penis in, but I had some trouble, not wasting any time, Lui reached out to help me with her hand and lined me up once more. I pushed in slowly, and she let out a moan of her own. 

"Hnng, just like that Anon!" Lui exclaimed. 

I moved back and forth, the sound of flesh slapping flesh became music to my ears combined with heavy breathing coming from me. Lui started pushing back at me, making loud slapping noises, moving from side to side, brushing me up against her walls.

I let out a loud moan and came inside. Lui must’ve felt me go soft, as she pulled away from me, I saw my cum leaking from her pussy onto the covers. I fell down on the bed completely exhausted and she lied next to me.

“So, did you like it, Anon?” I heard her say.

I can’t remember my answer, for I fell asleep.

Next morning, I woke up after her, she was already dressed in some casual clothes. She invited me to stay for breakfast, but I politely passed her up on the offer and I got dressed as quickly as I could to walk out. She opened the door for me and gave me a soft goodbye kiss.

Once I made it back home, I got in my bathroom immediately. Did all of that really happen? Was it too rude for me to just walk out like that? Overall, there was one thought that wouldn’t stop bothering me:

Was I good enough for her? Did I even make her feel good?

I felt like curling up in a ball, even now I couldn’t stop these stupid trains of thought.

I took off my shirt and saw a little surprise in the mirror. I had two hickeys on my chest. Did Lui make them? When? When I was asleep? Why? What does it mean?

I took a quick shower to calm down, and came out feeling a lot better. The hickeys remained on my chest. I pressed on them, touched them, squeezed them to make sure they were actually there, and indeed, they were.

Still, I couldn’t let go of the feeling that I had been a chore to Lui, instead of someone she had fun with.

Before I could start drowning in my own self-pity again, I got two text messages from an unsaved number.

“Hi Anon”

“Want to go out for a coffee one of these days?”
