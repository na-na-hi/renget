->Diary of Conquest<-
->DO NOT READ OR RISK PERFORATION FROM 1000 ARROWS<-
>Vampires
The classic scheming, bloodsucking shitheads: just as liable to backstab themselves as they will you, which is very likely.  Better to purify them and leave the redemption to their thralls.
	>Quentin King
	The usual Immortal with a god complex, more of a schemer than a fighter.  Right now, I wouldn't be suprised if he was gunning after the crown.
	>Alicia de Ville
	I pray every night that Pestilance gets chosen to figure what her and her clique do, because I cannot stand vapid sluts like her.

>Werewolves
A scarier proposition than most because of their ability to tear people apart in close range and close that range quickly, not even bringing up their flanking and ambush tactics.  Not _evil_ in the sense a Cthulid is, more like trying to fight or negotiate with a Mountain Lion.
	>Caroline Hayward
	Another "Roastie Squad" slut: See Alicia de Ville for my thoughts on them.
	>Olaf Goodwinson
	Scary motherfucker, not much else to say.  Never met him, hope it stays that way unless all of us in the same place to take him on.
	>Scott Caledonia
	Seems to be some kind of enforcer for the werewolves, keeping their rouges in check.  Seems as relaxed as a wolf man can be.

>Fae
While not the greatest fighters, they match vampires in scheming prowess combined with a mages knowledge and power.  At the very least, they tend toward diplomacy first and are probably not too interested in forcing an apocalypse.
	>Emelia Shadowsong
	A fellow archer, though one with elemental powers and disarming beauty: It'd be a rough sniper duel, but I could win it.

>Cthulid
Monsters of the highest caliber that are looking to do our job but without the "redemption" part: KILL ON SIGHT.
	>Greed
	Some combination between youkai and cthulid: probably the one behind all of this if I had to put my money on it.

>Fallen
Where we technically fall(though Death and Famine have weirder traits that put them in the catch-all).  Allies for the most part, since the other voices in my head tell me I can see heaven if I do good enough in my work and that must be a good incentive.
	>Zander Merrick
	A blow hard who I heard was trying to buy an ammunition factory to prosecute a war against the dragons.  Could be a good ally if his info is good.
	>Joshua Morningstar
	He comes around the boarding house alot, though something about him makes me want to punch him in the face with brass knuckles.  Maybe its cause he's the one who coached War to be a shithead.
	>War
	A smug fuck who I've had to suffer working with for years.  He's immature, slow, and relies more on playing people against eachother than just sweeping the competition off the board.  I'll admit its nice when he gets me a new dress or something, but that does not make us friends.
	
>Demon
The threat we know the best, and the one I get the best kick out of shooting at.  Its hard to have pity for a being which only seeks to drag humans down to their ashpit so they can do unspeakable things to them. 
	>Cherie Fonesca
	The Roastie's resident slutty demoness, probably loaded with more STD's than Pestilence can cook up with her magic.

>Zombie
The most numerous group, and the one we can actually save, though Death is better at that sort of thing than I am.  Their not immune to fucking around and finding out though.
	>Natalie Windsor
	Is there a marriage market for bloated, diseased sluts?  I guess so.
	>Sweeney
	Likes to talk to a big game, but is around for a reason other than his catchy name: while I don't like him as a person he's too valuable to just kill.

>Dragons
The Raid Bosses of supernatural monsters for a reason: even their lesser offspring are serious threats on par with angry trolls.  Combine that strength with ruthless cunning and magic and you get a dragon.  Require careful planning to even take one on.
	>Senna Netherclaw
	More of a legend than person from what I hear: runs a bank in the shitty part of town that supposedly has tons of dirty money going through it, but I'm not in a position to topple that.  Even then, some of the other Conquest's are pretty insistent she's more useful alive than dead.

 >Experiments/Catch-all
Essentially everyone thats clearly supernatural without being easily defined.  My english teacher would call this bad organization, but one of the conquest's in my head says he's a lying dumbass when it comes to grammer so I guess I'm right after all.
	>"Tom"
	I know almost nothing about that guy other than the fact he might be connected to organ harvesting rings: If he's keeping a low profile he's either very weak, very smart, or very strong.
	>Evan Harker
	An abomination that needs to be put out of its misery.  Nothing else makes sense for something so dangerous and pitiful.
	>Death
	The closest thing to a parent I have nowadays, and even if she can be cold at times, she's sobering to have around.  Calling her "mom" still feels awkward though despite everything we've been through and social waffling isn't really what I need to focusing on now.
	>Mister Smith
	Might just be an urban legend, but knowing this city, it could be out there: GOD knows what it wants or why its so insistent on secrecy.  I'm scared of it/him/whatever the hell this thing might actually be.
	>Famine
	An older brother of sorts.  Or he used to be after we got him back and he started mumbling about creepy shit.  I can't just treat him like normal the way War seems to try: Something corrupted him, something were going to have to face.  But he's still family, in a sense.
	We have to save him, or least the shard of Famine.  He still cooks tasty meals.

>Humans
Meddler's and fools alike, but some manage to survive in the supernatural world.  One of the quotes I had to learn in school was that if you put 6 humans in a room, you get 12 opinions: and based on my life before this and seeing things from a wider perspective, I'd agree with the old guy who wrote that.
	>Crow
	Seems to be a college kid who knows healing magic, along with some offensive magic: I've had to use her services before when I was in a bad spot: 
	ALWAYS PAY ON TIME
	>Owen
	A psycho who I can respect since he uses a shotgun and a cross to fight fucking vampires: alone.  Might be half-way turned, or maybe a demon, but I get the feeling he's the type who would piss Death off for using senseless violence.
	>Cleaner 7
	Another urban legend, a mage who supposedly cleans up after supernatural incidents to keep things from "scaling up".  The only consistent thing I hear is that their female, so their might a little truth to it.
	>Pestilence
	A human who seemed to learn magic just to join us: I have no idea how she figured out I was more than just a weird albino who cut class alot.  At this point, Death lets her hang around since she isn't a weight on our necks and she even has rights to the boarding house's couch if she wants to crash with us.
