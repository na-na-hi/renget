-> I had a bumpy beginning with Wart. I was first distressed but accepting. I claimed that he could be worse. <-
-> He grew on me like lichen on a tree! I said in late 2020, "like. not even wart jr is ugly to me hes actually adorable and i cant get enough of him hes so small". <-

-> He was ascending in my favorites among my villagers. Something about him captivated me. <-
-> I stated that Cube, Wart, and Phoebe, of which Cube and Wart would stay with me in New Horizons, were the only things I was staying alive for. <-
-> I called him my baby boy! <-
-> After cataloging many times with him and others as my 3Ds broke, I handmade his amiibo and brought him into my world on my Switch. That was very special and fun to me. <-
