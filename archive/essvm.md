“Look, it’s all very simple. You didn’t pay your taxes this month and your house is being given to 
someone who actually earns a profit.”
He started up at the wolf, if they where the same size he’d have smacked this kid upside the head 
three times over by now. Unfortunately he’d been affected by the mass shrinking and was left at barely 
an inch in height. Whats worse, this wolf showed up out of nowhere and declared himself and 
proclaimed that he’d bought the entire settlement he’d been relegated to. Apparently the state official 
that was in charge of guarding the settlement had sold them away for a measly 300 dollars….to this 
wolf.
The first thing he did was declare that the entire settlement was to become his new company and that 
everyone living there was to start mining cryptocurrencies for him or else. Nobody really cared much 
to find out what they meant by ‘Or else’ They remembered what it was like when the shrink pandemic 
first occurred. It wasn't like anyone had access to tiny guns or anything, and the wolf could...and did 
quell any resistance with a few steps.
“Look, my-”
“Look what?” The wolf interjected, his smirk somehow growing wider.
The badger sighed. “Look sir. My computer broke. I cant mine crypto for you.”
The wolf leaned forward in his squeaky computer chair, looming over the older male, sending the 
badger on his back foot in fright. “Then you buy a new one.”
He grimaced. “I cant afford a new computer.”
“What?” the wolf scoffed, leaning back in his seat. “You cant be serious. How can a grown man not 
afford a single computer?”
Again, the urge to beat this annoying prick up surged. “All the computers in the settlement have 
skyrocketed in price. Maybe because somebody demands that everyone have a computer to mine 
fucking cry-”
The wolf rolled his eyes. “Excuses excuses. Bottom line, you’re not making me any money so you 
don’t get a house.”
The badger sighed. He’d heard the wolf do something like this, shift people around the settlement, 
top earners got better houses. He called it trickle down economics which was so demonstrably wrong 
but it wasn't like anyone dared correct him. “So what, do I get an apartment?”
“Nope.” The badger put his hands behind his head, reclining back further. “Apartments are for 
earners.”
He cocked his head. “Then what?”
A wide smile spread across the wolfs face. And he leaned in closer again. “Well, I can still squeeze 
some profit outta ya. Go a buyer lined up who always wanted a micro of his own.”
It was like he just got dunked into cold water. His knees felt faint and his vision blurred. He’d heard 
the rumors but he didn’t think the wolf was actually selling them off. “N-no!”
“I wasn't asking your permission.” The wolf scoffed. “Think of it from my perspective. Cant have 
any lazy money drains living here. You’ll bring the entire settlement down.”
He looked around, trying to find a means of escape, but due to his small size, something as simple as 
a desk proved to be a massive inescapable platform. He looked up to the wolf. “P-please!” He begged. 
“Anything but that! I-i can get the money! I’ll do anything!”
The wolf raised an eyebrow. “Hmm. Anything you say?”
“Y-yeah!” The badger nodded. 
“Well.” The wolf leaned his head to the side, pulling his seat closer to the desk, looming over the 
little badger even more. “I am in the mood for some...personal services.”
A chill went up his spine at the tone in the wolfs voice, he’d heard the description ‘like a spider 
regarding a fly in their web’ but had never actually heard anything that could be described like that so 
aptly. Swallowing, he forced himself to meet the wolfs eager gaze. “A-anything.”
Before he could react, the wolfs hand shot out and a thumb clamped down on his torso. He was held 
up to the wolfs massive face, the wolfs focus on something else. A loud tearing sound came from 
below, as the badger looked down, the fingers parted, sending him falling down, shrieking all the way. 
Instead of a quick death against the cold hard floor,, he landed on something soft, and warm...and 
very strongly scented. The badger opened his eyes and looked down, under him was a large mass of 
thick, dark fur, somewhat damp and radiating a very thick scent. A throb at his back drew his attention 
to his rear.
Rising up at his back was a monolith of pink flesh, several times his own height, thicker than he was 
tall, pulsing in the air looming over him. He couldn’t tear his eyes away, while he’d gotten somewhat 
used to the idea of how much smaller he was than the normals, it didn’t mean the realization that he 
was barely even a fraction of the size of the wolf cock felt any better.
“Don't just stare at it. Get to work.” the wolfs voice chattered from above him.
The badger snapped his neck up, looking up at the wolfs face past the young canines massive torso, 
staring down at him with the same, punch-able smug face. “Y-you cant be serious!”
“What? You said you’d do anything.” The wolf scoffed. “Now get me off.”
“I cant-” the badger looked between the wolfs massive face and huge cock. “H-how?!”
The wolf shrugged. “Improvise.”
The badger swallowed and turned around, stepping up to the monolithic cock. The smell was intense,
he could feel his heart race with each inhale, the young canines musk strong enough to affect his mind. 
He put his hands against the soft flesh, feeling the rush of blood coursing through it with each of the 
wolfs heartbeats. Planting his feet, he kneaded his hands into the shaft.
A low rumble was felt through the wolfs body as he let out a soft moan. “Haah… kind a tickles. Put 
some effort into it.”
He pushed his hands into it as hard as he could, not really sensing much change from the wolf.
“Use your tongue.”
He snapped back to the wolf, as if hoping the massive capitalist would tell him he was just kidding, 
instead he had the same smug stare, through very hungry lidded eyes. Grimacing, he took a deep breath
and leaned his face in, sticking his tongue against the warm flesh. A salty, sweaty flavor invaded his 
mouth, almost forcing his head back from sheer instincts.
“Mmmh, that's good.” the wolf mused. “But not good enough.”
Before he could do anything, thick, gray furred fingers wrapped around the cock...and himself. In an 
instant he was caught in between the wolfs palm and his cock, the throbbing flesh squeezing and 
crushing with each pulse. Then the wolf started pumping his fist up and down, starting slowly. 
In what felt like an eternity, the badger felt the wolfs cock drag across his face, from the base to the 
softer, more sensitive flesh of the wolfs tip. The hand shot down again before moving up once more.
A clear liquid started too ooze from the tip, a mixed blessing for the Badger. On one hand, it provided
lubrication to save him from the burning friction each movement imparted on his body, on the other he 
could barely breathe past the thick miasma of the wolfs musk, and the pre coating his face in gallons.
The hand sped up, oozing more of the wolfs juices, the grip becoming tighter, the heat building up 
more and more. The badger couldn’t get a breath in past the wolfs seed pouring into his mouth, his 
attempts to catch his breath resulting in a mouthful of the wolfs juices.
The cock throbbed and he felt the hand stopped. His vision cleared just in time to see where he was. 
In front of his was a small, fleshy hole, leaking a milky, thick liquid from him. The badger made the 
mistake of opening his mouth to scream, just as the wolf climaxed.
A torrent of white hot seed shot out from the tip, blasting the wolf in the face, filling his mouth and 
coating his face. Another rope shot out just as he tried to gasp for air, mouthfuls of cum going down his
throat. The hand shifted in order to smear the rest of the badgers body in the wolfs cum, the last trickles
losing power, simply leaking out.
Gravity shifted around him before he felt himself falling...or rather leaking from the wolf palm, back 
onto the desk.
“*huff* That- *haah!* that felt great…” the wolf panted, using his underwear to wipe of his dick.
The badger snapped up, using his hands to clear his face, sputtering and gasping for breath. He was 
coated from head to toe in the wolfs cum, sitting in a small pool of it. “A-*Hurp* Am I done?!” He 
gasped.
“Yeah.” The wolf sighed. “I’m gonna have to charge more for you guys, that was great. The buyer is 
gonna love you.”
His eyes went wide. “B-but you said-”
The wolf plucked the little badger out of the white, sticky puddle and shook a bit of the cum off, 
wiping him off on the outside of his underwear. “I said if you got me off, and you couldn’t do that. I 
had to do all the work here.” 
He held the badger to his face, the micro was waiving his arms around, as if trying to attack him. 
Cute in a sort of pathetic way. With a smirk, the wolf grabbed an empty matchbox from the desk and 
slipped the badger inside, snapping it shut.
 Maybe he could charge the client extra by saying it was tested and quality guaranteed?
