**We're your relief. Get outta here.**
Little late, aren't you?
*Would you rather we not be here?*
Hey, hey, just poking fun. Enjoy looking out at nothing for the next few hours.
*We'll try.*

**Hey.**
*Yeah?*
**You ever wonder why we're here?**
*...*
*You mean like why we're standing out in the blazing sun, rather than inside in the cool?*
**...
Well, I was sorta asking in the philosophical sense, but yeah, that too.
Y'know, considering that there's security cameras everywhere, it doesn't feel like we're really needed.**
*It's because they mostly face inwards. We're here to look out and try and spot anything approaching the base.*
**...**
*Also, because we're being paid to stand here.*

**Okay. Three. Two. One. Go!
Rock!** *Paper!*
**Auugh, how do you keep doing that?!**
*You've literally picked rock the last five times.*
**Yeah, but you're mean to pick paper at some point! It's reverse psychology or something!**
*Well, now I'm definitely not picking paper.*
**This game is stupid anyway. You could totally beat up some paper with a rock.**
*That's not the point of the game. It's meant to be a...
Do you see that?*
**See what?**
*There, off in the distance. What is that?
Looks like it's getting closer.*
**Hold on, I've got a set of binoculars.
Oh, shit.
That's a fast fucking robot.**
*Oh* \*fuck\* *he's moving fast.*
**More behind him too!
What are you waiting for, call Control!**
*Y-yeah.
