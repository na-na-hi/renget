!!! note Update - 12 Dec
	->I've updated my Furbo preset to no longer end with retrospectives/summaries, along with minor edits to what the codeblock generates. Slight changes to the Temp, Frequency, and Presence penalties. ~~Seed value is set at 10, but it may reset to -1 randomly. Be sure to verify it's set to the correct value.~~ Made a small edit to how the selected writing styles are chosen and how it would affect aspects of the response.<-
