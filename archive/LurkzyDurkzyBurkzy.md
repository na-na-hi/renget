!!! note Update - 13 Dec
	->Added my bias preset that discourages the usage of certain words. Restructured where specific instructions are placed to reduce the mess. The chosen author's should be more in-line with the type of scene and response needed, so it doesn't remain static throughout all the various genres/dyamics your chats may contain.<-
