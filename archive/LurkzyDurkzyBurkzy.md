Changelog:
12 Oct - v1.3 is public. Wrote instructions that prevents Assistant from rehashing established aspects already written 
in previous Assistant: responses within <chat>.

13 Oct - v1.4. Adjusted "Manipulate 1" to identify the genre of the current scene, encouraging it to modify <objectives> to 
better suit the identified genre. This theoretically should make the narration more in-tune with the scene (NSFW or SFW).
Removed "Quick Coom" prompt item. Temp has been increased, however feel free to tune it down if it gets schitzo.

15 Oct - v1.41. Very minor changes, aimed at minimizing how much Claude tries to advance the scene.

16 Oct - v1.5. Further refinements in <objectives>, telling Assistant to focus on 1 or 2 micro scene advancements rather then 
multiple, and then reinforcing this.

17 Oct - v1.6. Added a NSFW enhancer prompt item that can be toggled on/off.
