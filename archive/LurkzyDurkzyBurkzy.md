-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changelog:
24 Oct - LasagnaBalls. It's sick.

27 Oct - ShaqsNutSack. Modified slightly to make Claude end its responses in a way that encourages actions/dialogue
from {{user}} as opposed to the usual "With {{user}} by her side, **anything** was possible..." 
Still not fully fleshed out!

29 Oct - Pete Davidsons's Rizz. Need I say more?

30 Oct - Pete Davidson's Era. Added a funny little experimental prompt that makes Assistant decide itself how long the
response should be. Aimed at stopping Claude from cooking a bit too much as it likes to do when the chat grows longer.
|-> Added a short clause for NSFW scenes, improves depictions of sexual acts whilst not being overly horny throughout.

!!! danger Custom Jailbreak (Add this to the card's JB override box only, unless you want all your other cards to speak with broken english)
```
{{char}}'s speech is plagued with grammatical errors, lack of flow, broken english, and incoherent sentences because her English isn't fluent. Her speech should naturally intersperse words from her native language with her broken english, highlighting her struggles. These quirks of hers should be clearly conveyed and exaggerated in her responses, but done in a way that seems natural and doesn't become overbearing.
