#Lurkzn's GPT-1106 and Claude 2 Presets (**FINAL** - 24 Nov)
!!! note Adieuuuuu
	-> I haven't been feeling AI for the past few weeks, with the release of GPT's 1106 model only temporarily reinvigorating my desire to interact with AI. This will be the final (for real this time) update on this Rentry. I wish all you degenerates the best! <3 <-
!!! warning About Claude
	-> A few anons have been requesting my older Claude 2 prompts. I've added it below. Thanks to the kind anon that shared it on the 4chan thread, I probably should have backed it up myself ðŸ¤”<-
!!! note More Claude - 4 Dec
	-> Shoutout to RobbieTheFella, who has archived all my previous Claude Presets. There's about 15 versions ðŸ˜‚, with the more colourful named ones being the most recent updates. I've uploaded it into a .zip, feel free to play around with them! They're mostly for Adventure/Slowburns, so NSFW will be lacking. I personally used John Cena v3 the most.<-
