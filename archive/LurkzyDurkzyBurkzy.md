	->[#Logs](https://rentry.org/LurkzyDurkzyBurkzy#logs-updated-17-oct) has been reconstructured. I'll be posting long form chats with different cards covering a wide variety of scenarios, from Saviorfagging, Slowburning, Exhibitionism etc... to highlight my presets strengths and weaknesses. If you would like to submit your card to be displayed here, send an email with the card and I'll showcase it here along with credits. **NO SLOP** ;)<-

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changelog:
12 Oct - v1.3 is public. Wrote instructions that prevents Assistant from rehashing established aspects already written 
in previous Assistant: responses within <chat>.

13 Oct - v1.4. Adjusted "Manipulate 1" to identify the genre of the current scene, encouraging it to modify <objectives> to 
better suit the identified genre. This theoretically should make the narration more in-tune with the scene (NSFW or SFW).
Removed "Quick Coom" prompt item. Temp has been increased, however feel free to tune it down if it gets schitzo.

15 Oct - v1.41. Very minor changes, aimed at minimizing how much Claude tries to advance the scene.

16 Oct - v1.5. Further refinements in <objectives>, telling Assistant to focus on 1 or 2 micro scene advancements rather 
than multiple, and then reinforcing this.

17 Oct - v1.6. Added a NSFW enhancer prompt item that can be toggled on/off.
