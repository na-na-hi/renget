#Lurkzn's GPT-1106 and Claude Preset (**FINAL** - 24 Nov)
!!! note Adieuuuuu
	-> I haven't been feeling AI for the past few weeks, with the release of GPT's 1106 model only temporarily reinvigorating my desire to interact with AI. This will be the final (for real this time) update on this Rentry. I wish all you degenerates the best! <3 <-
!!! warning About Claude
	-> A few anons have been requesting my older Claude prompt. I've added it below. Thanks to the kind anon that shared it on the 4chan thread, I probably should have backed it up myself ðŸ¤”<-
