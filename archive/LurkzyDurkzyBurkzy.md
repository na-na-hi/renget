-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changelog:
24 Oct - LasagnaBalls. It's sick.

27 Oct - ShaqsNutSack. Modified slightly to make Claude end its responses in a way that encourages actions/dialogue
from {{user}} as opposed to the usual "With {{user}} by her side, **anything** was possible..." 
Still not fully fleshed out!

29 Oct - Pete Davidsons's Rizz. Need I say more?

30 Oct - Pete Davidson's Era. Added a funny little experimental prompt that makes Assistant decide itself how long the
response should be. Aimed at stopping Claude from cooking a bit too much as it likes to do when the chat grows longer.
|-> Added a short clause for NSFW scenes, improves depictions of sexual acts whilst not being overly horny throughout.

1 Nov - KanyeBallsInMouth. Fixed a few contradictory instructions.

**User Info**: Input your chat specific persona here! 
```
Example persona:
{{user}} is a quiet, introverted teen who recently lost their mother, 
father, and son to zombies. Whilst clumsy and seemingly incapable 
at first glance, {{user}} is fiercely loyal and protective, and will prioritise 
others' safety over himself. He has a muscular body hidden under his clothes, 
after years spent gymming in secret.
```

##->My personal procedure and settings for slowburns<-
I use the Summarization module whenever I do slowburns, configured to automatically summarise every 10 messages, in 200 words. After 50 responses, ensuring the summary is updated to account for the fiftieth message, and the LAST {{char}} response is copied, I start a new chat, replacing the intro message with the copied response, and then navigating over to the summarization module and pasting the latest summary. Below is the custom prompt I use to summarise. Usually I have to manually modify the summary to include/remove certain details, which I encourage you to do the same.
```
Human: Pause the roleplay. Analyse the story in its entirety, and update your memory with key events and interactions that have played a part in shaping the current story and relationship dynamics between {{user}} and {{char}}. Using what is stored in your memory, write a {{words}} word summary based on this, and if a previous summary has already been generated, modify it as appropriate, using it as a base (The {{words}} word count limit still applies). Your response should include nothing but the summary.
```

!!! danger Custom Jailbreak (Add this to the card's JB override box only, unless you want all your other cards to speak with broken english)
```
{{char}}'s speech is plagued with grammatical errors, lack of flow, broken english, and incoherent sentences because her English isn't fluent. Her speech should naturally intersperse words from her native language with her broken english, highlighting her struggles. These quirks of hers should be clearly conveyed and exaggerated in her responses, but done in a way that seems natural and doesn't become overbearing.
