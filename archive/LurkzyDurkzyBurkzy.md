#%darkred%L%%%darkblue%U%%%yellow%R%%%purple%K%%%violet%z%%'s Furbo and Claude 2 Presets
##->%darkgreen%Updated%% - 30 Dec (Furbo)<-
->**Logs genned using my presets are displayed [Here!](https://rentry.org/LURKzLogs)**<-
!!! danger Purpose
	-> For now, this preset will be geared towards storyline with a hint of NSFW, as opposed to Coom (Incest, NTR, Voyeurism etc...). This will not be the preset to use if you're after a quick coom. However, if you like Saviorfagging, Adventure/Fantasy, Slowburns, Survival etc..., this will be better suited for you!<-
!!! note Updates 
	-> 29 Dec - %lightBlue%TenWishes%% (Furbo). Modified the hardcoded 'Respond in 3 paragraphs', adjusted to give AI the option to choose between 1-3 paragraphs, using their best judgement whilst adhering to negative directives set by {{user}}. Changed how NPC's are handled, taking steps to minimise their presence being forced into each scene in a way that doesn't add much to the current interaction.<-

	-> 30 Dec - %lightBlue%TenWishes%% (Furbo). Minor adjustment to ensure the entirety of {{user}}'s response gets addressed, rather than just specific portions, which happens sporadically.<-

!!! note Toggleable Prompt(s) for Furbo
	->%orange%[Sexo]%% - **%red%Disabled%%** by default. {{user}} can enable this whenever they want {{char}}'s response to angle towards starting sexual interactions/continue sexual interactions. I recommend **%red%disabling%%** the prompt after {{user}}'s response states they (either {{user}} or {{char}}) have climaxed, in order to prevent {{char}}'s next response from looping towards another sexual interaction rather than resuming the story-arc.<-

->This will remove the codeblock from the final response, saving tokens and potentially not poisoning future responses. <-
