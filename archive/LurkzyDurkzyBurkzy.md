#Lurkzn's GPT-1106 Preset (**FINAL** - 24 Nov)
!!! note Adieuuuuu
	-> I haven't been feeling AI for the past few weeks, with the release of GPT's 1106 model only temporarily reinvigorating my desire to interact with AI. This will be the final (for real this time) update on this Rentry. I wish all you degenerates the best! <3 <-

!!! note Notes
	->The default word count range is between 200-350. This can be adjusted by clicking on the "Output" add-on in the Prompt Manager chain and modifying it as needed.<-

###->Multi-model chats<-
!!! danger
	->Purely experimental and prone to cluster fucks, but if GPT isn't as explicit/depraved as you want it to be, switching the response to answer using Claude could work. I highly recommend starting chats with GPT, then ONLY using Claude 2.0 during explicit/sexual scenes, switching back to GPT for proper story and character building. No further modifications besides below should be needed.<-

->My preset uses a significant amount of negative instructions, which has almost 0 weightage to Claude. As such, please ONLY use it for use cases such as the above, sticking predominantly to GPT as intended.<-
