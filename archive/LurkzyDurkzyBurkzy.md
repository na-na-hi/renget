###->Multi-model chats<-
!!! danger
	->Purely experimental and prone to cluster fucks, but if GPT isn't as explicit/depraved as you want it to be, switching the response to answer using Claude could work. I highly recommend starting chats with GPT, then ONLY using Claude 2.0 during explicit/sexual scenes, switching back to GPT for proper story and character building. No further modifications besides below should be needed.<-

->My preset uses a significant amount of negative instructions, which has almost 0 weightage to Claude. As such, please ONLY use it for use cases such as the above, sticking predominantly to GPT as intended.<-
