######Graveyard Shift.

The child runs, he really should know better than to hang out around a graveyard deep during the night, still, sometimes your neighbours challenge you to stupid shit and momma didn't raise no bitch.
"Moss grows from the weeping of the trees~"
"When time sleeps the specters of the past haunt us dreams"
"Primordial soup of chaos we were all"
"The world spins round enveloped by the void"
"Nothing but observers of the universe~"
And so sings the gravekeeper to the gravekeeper, not much to do during dark nights when even the owls are sleeping, still, the hunt is on, there's no wonder what one of those psychopaths might do to an inoffensive child who has commited a transgression against the dead.
"Come on kid, I'm not gonna eat ya" The gravekeeper cackles to herself. She keeps swinging the shovel around, she's walking, but still somehow catching up to the running child, in fact, the child has no escape as he has unfortunately tripped over the mud and right into, well, more mud. The gravekeeper almost instantly picks the child up. "Well hello there, kid, had your fun didn't you?" The gravekeeper's honey eyes shine in the dark. Years of patrolling the graveyard showing themselves in an instant. "You know kid, you could get me in some real trouble, what would my employers think about a child making a mess in MY graveyard! I'll have to take you in custody, Ha Ha Ha! Don't worry, my good buddy knows how to handle kids, he has 5, after all".
The child, at this point, passed out, wasn't capable of hearing about his fate, and as far as he knew, he basically teleported into the cold room of the undertaker, or rather, the warm part of the cold room, an aged man in a raincoat, who looks about 50 years old is the one taking care of him.
"Look who woke up, what's your name kid?"
"Uh, am I dead? Are you death? I thought it was Lady Death, not old man death" He replies.
"Ain't you a curious little thing, you are not dead, I am not death, and yes, Lady Death is quite the voluptous lady, from what I've been told"
"Oh, then who's you?"
"Just your local undertaker, not a god damn baby sitter"
"Hey, I'm no baby! I'll have you know I'm 12! Basically an adult!"
"Har har, an adult would know better than hanging out around the graveyard, what gave you the idea? A bet?" The child looks shocked at the surprising insight shown by the old man, he correctly guessed what was up.
"Y-yes! I would've gotten some pretty nice cash from it"
"You dumb kids and your dumb challenges, you really remind me of my oldest child, now about 22, real pain in the head that kid, once he stole a horse and he couldn't get down, ran around the entire town until we caught the dumb ass, what was I saying? Doesn't matter, you'll have to stay here until morning, that girl outside is very zealous about her job, no rule breaking on her watch"
"Guess I'm pretty lucky, then, I'll have a neat story to tell tomorrow, err, today? How long until morning?"
"Hmm, about 4 hours, you did pass out for a while, guess I'll let you out into the break room, it is going to be a long night, or maybe not"
The Undertaker gets up and stretches, the bones cracking indicating a long work session. He slides his graying hair back and stands still for a bit, then he steps towards the door of the room and goes outside, the coldness of the room is slightly colder than the outside, somehow.
"Oof, it's windy, come on kid, get up"
The gravekeeper stands at the top of a building, presumably where the breakroom is supposedly located, her location only being given away by her calling out to the Undertaker. "Oi, ya fucking imbecile, the hell are you doing!?" The Undertaker replies with a strong shout "You left the kid on the coldest room in here! What the hell are YOU doing!?". Clearly annoyed, the gravekeeper jumps down and catches up to the Undertaker quickly.
Finally illuminated by the small candle light the Undertaker was carrying, the child could finally see the supposed figure of terror that protected the dead. A tall woman wearing a long coat and carrying a shovel on her shoulder, towering over the Undertaker, her baggy pants looking warm and protective, with multiple patches to reinforce it, and boots that cover a part of the lower pants. Most of her face is covered up by an ushanka and bandana combo. Only the aforementioned honey colored eyes are visible.
"So, what's the big idea?"
"I'm taking the kid to the break room"
"It's dangerous, didn't you hear? I took him to ya for a reason"
"Oh really, and that being?"
"Wendigo"
"Shit"
"Yeah now ya get it, fucking cunt"
"Oh back off, you should've told me first"
"I did, and the Mayor is pissing himself o'er it, you know they like to go for children"
The intimidated child speaks up, for once "Wh- what's a wendigo?"
"Oh you don't know kid? It's a real scary thing, there's a few theories on how they come up, greed overtaking a human, messed up rituals from the druids, cannibalism, but what's for sure, is that they are very hungry creatures, and the worst part is that they take over warg nests"
"But wargs aren't real!"
The gravekeeper scoffs "Maybe, don't think of them as the human looking things you hear in legend, see them as the bastard dogs they are, well, I'm getting a bit off the point ,innit? I'll take you fellows to the break room, you'll be bait"
"Ah goddamnit" Exclaims the Undertaker, he gets an old pistol handed to him by the Gravekeeper.
"Alright kid, I'll try to keep you safe, but I'm not promising anything"
The Breakroom is quite warm, incredibly cozy, however, by far the most stunning view when entering it, is the large amount of weapons there are, spears, swords, and rifles.
"Oi, old man, what's that square looking knife there?"
The Undertaker while lighting up the candles in the room replies. "A bayonet, no wait, probably an executioner's sword... thing's too long to be a bayonet, althought, I do recall seeing some designs for square bayonets"
"You were in the army?"
"Nah, contracted medic, had to take lots of jobs to pay for my family, my wife and I have a lot of kids, hell, even had to take care of that gravekeeper outside"
"But she's really tall, can't be that young"
"Haha, you'd be surprised kid, she's in her 20s, incredibly young for a job like this, but some people are just marked by death, the other gravekeepers are older and more experienced, so she's got good mentors" The old man looks at the kid "Your parents are gonna be worried when they wake up, eh?". The child thinks about what to say. "Eh, maybe not, they're not exactly light sleepers, and I get to be outside a lot"
"Alright, if you say so, I'll put some coffee on"
"Oooh, can I have some?"
"I'll warn you now, it's not the best quality you'll find on the market"
"That's fine, we're all used to bad coffee"

On the top of the building, the gravekeeper observes with her shining eyes, waiting, the first sign of a wendigo attack is a warg rush, the wendigo wants to feed the wargs to solidify the hold over the wargs, then it can expand its territory and run off all other wild life.
The rumbling and howling indicates it, they are here, ready for feeding, coming in from the east side of the graveyard, they jump over the iron fence and start digging graves as quickly as they can. However, that makes them easy pickings.
The gravekeeper jumps and uses her shovel, sharpened for stabbing, to land on top of an unaware warg, cutting off its head. To keep up the momentum, the shovel is swung into another warg and it is split in half under the weight of the swing, the third and fourth wargs jump to assault from the left and right, and both of them are hit by another swing using the solid part of the shovel. As they're thrown to the ground, the finishing blow is granted to one of them by the crushing of the head by the heavy boot of the Gravekeeper. The fourth has wisened up to the ambush and won't be such easy prey now. It stands up and bares its horrid fangs and howls towards the silent gravekeeper, its knifelike fingers curling in anticipation.
The gravekeeper thrusts the shovel into the body of the warg, pushing it to the wall, but it jumps over and lands on the shovel instead. The ward is met with a swift punch into its nose. The crushing sound of its cartilage incapacitating it for a key moment, and it gets a rock right into the face. The gravekeeper pummeling the head of the warg multiple times until its brains are visible.
Once the damage is clearly done, the next step begins, as the first party is dismantled, the wendigo will instead show himself to investigate, and as warg nests are precious things, it is common for the wendigo to appear alone to mantain the potential attack force.
The Gravekeeper stands up and grabs her shovel, ready to face the terrifying wendigo. Fortunately, the traps she set weren't wasted by the warg attack, but if she's lucky, she'll be able to solo the wendigo with minimal damage.
All of a sudden, she hears the approaching steps of the wendigo, bones cracking, and trees snapping. The stench of rotten meat making itself known. The Wendigo appears, a tall monster of an impressive height, this specimen seems to be about 3 and a half meters long when standing, it is thin, and it looks as if it doesn't have muscle mass, but don't be fooled, its strength is undeniable. It's face is shaped by the skull of a deer, long horns and the bright eyes of a hunter shine throught the exposed skull.
"Come on, ya rotten piece of meat, I'll cut your guts off and use them for sausage"
The wendigo awakens, seemingly insulted by this taunt, althought, it is impossible to tell if they can understand speech, smart creatures such as them are dangerous.
It extends its long limbs and swings them around, but they get dodged by some clever movements and the wendigo further enters the graveyard, where it is met with its first trap. A wire which snaps under the weight of the wendigo, failing its goal of knocking the monster down. As it was unpercievable by the monster, it suspects nothing and the second trap can go on. A cacophony of rifles is heard, its incessant popping blasting the wendigo's exposed body. Clearly hurt, it is time to exploit the moment, and the Gravekeeper rushes forward, swinging the shovel from the inside out, a leg is cut off by abusing the parts hurt by the rifle fire. This drops the wendigo to the ground where it keeps swinging blind, the gravekeeper keeping her momentum and doing as owls would do to large prey, she rips out the eyes of the Wendigo by hand, proving herself the superior hunter. She then goes for the kill, cutting off each limb until she gets to the head, which she crushes with the shovel.
The wendigo is down. Filled with bullets, and cut off from every limb, but finally dead.
So, she sets up a small perimeter with some fences, and goes to call out the undertaker so he can examine... whatever the wendigo is supposed to be.

BANG BANG BANG
"Oi, open up, I killed the thing. Do your job now."
"Hoho, see, I told you kid, nothing to be scared of"
"Old man, you were the one who dropped his cup when he heard the pops"
The door is open and the gravekeeper enters, covered in blood and guts. "Greetings, the situation has been resolved, this blood ain't mine by the way"
"Yeah no wonder, smells too rotten for it to be yours" Says the Undertaker. "What's the kill count?"
"4 wargs, 1 wendigo" The Gravekeeper replies "Yo kid, you should check out how he works on anomalous entities, it's awesome"
The kid covers his nose "Ough, that smell is horrible"
"You get used to it" Reply the Undertaker and the Gravekeeper in unison.

Certainly, the child was made to see how the Undertaker worked, and the smell was horrible, especially with how he had to carry some the wargs and their cut off heads to the laboratory.
"You know kid, we don't get to work on these things too much, they require a lot of damage to kill, so what's left is most often a bloody mess of skin and guts, I was pretty clean this time thought"
"Sure, of the 4 wargs only 2 are workable" Snarks the Undertaker.
"That's a record" Says the Gravekeeper with an unseen smirk
"However, I'll commend you, you managed to keep the wendigo's head relatively safe, and you managed to keep the eyes too, we're about to advance the field of study on these things by a kilometer and a half, I know a couple of researchers who would kill to see its brain"

And so, morning comes, with only having to vomit a couple of times, the child nonetheless went home safe, he did not have a good reason to why he was covered in blood and guts, however, and had to tell the truth of hanging out in the graveyard after dark to his parents, who promptly gave him the nagging he deserved.
