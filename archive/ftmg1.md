##Am I Trans?##

What does "trans" mean?

*Trans is an umbrella term for individuals whose gender expression and/or gender identity differs from conventional expectations based on the physical sex they were assigned at birth. We use the term to include a wide range of identities including transgender, transsexual, transvestite, genderqueer, genderfluid, non-binary, agender, and two-spirit.*

**I’m questioning my gender. How do I know if I’m trans?**

One of the most repeated pieces of advice is, “Only you can really know.”

But what if you don’t know? The best way to understand your feelings on gender and decide whether you want to transition is to examine your feelings from day to day. Keep a journal about how you feel about your gender, and talk to someone whom you trust. Talking to a therapist who is experienced in gender issues can be very helpful. If possible, experiment with your presentation—try dressing more masculine, binding, getting a haircut, and see how you feel. Give yourself plenty of time to figure this all out.

**When I was a child I didn’t do typical boy things or call myself a boy. Could I still be trans?**

Yes. Many men, both cis and trans, were not overtly boyish as children. Some trans men claimed themselves to be boys when they were children, but many did not. We are informed by our parents and by society what is expected of us—to be girls—and it can be very difficult to start questioning that message.

**I don’t feel that much discomfort with living life as a female. Could I still be trans?**

Yes. Some trans men live happily as female for many years before realizing they want to transition.

If you’re questioning whether or not you are trans, it helps to sit down and think deeply about why you’re questioning this. Maybe you’ve never been too uncomfortable living as a female, but when you start exploring, you find that you’d much rather live as a male. Reflecting on your feelings about gender is a great way to work through this question. You might find that you identify more with another identity under the trans umbrella such as genderqueer, nonbinary, or gender nonconforming, which is great too.

***I have little to no gender dysphoria. Could I still be trans?***

Yes. Not everyone's is the same. Some people have very little of gender dysphoria or even no gender dysphoria. Some people will tell you that people with no gender dysphoria are not trans. Ignore those people. The definition of "transgender" is someone's whose gender identity is different than the one assigned to them at birth, not whether or not someone has gender dysphoria.

However, if you’re seeking medical treatment that requires a diagnosis of gender dysphoria, you should be aware of the diagnosis criteria for gender dysphoria. [The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-V)](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/gender-dysphoria/what-is-gender-dysphoria) provides the diagnosis criteria for Gender Dysphoria in the United States. The criteria is different for adolescents and adults than it is for children.

Another resources to be aware of if you are seeking medical assistance in regards to transitioning or with assistance in regards to gender questioning is the [World Profession Association for Transgender Health (WPATH).](https://www.wpath.org/about/mission-and-vision) WPATH [provides the standards of care](https://www.wpath.org/publications/soc) which many medical institutions (including insurance companies) use in creating guidelines on providing medical treatment to transgender, transsexual, and gender nonconforming individuals. It provides in-depth guidelines on, not only treating gender dysphoria but also treating transgender, transsexual, and gender nonconforming individuals with respect, flexibility, and care. These guidelines can be used to advocate for yourself, and if necessary, educate your care providers.

**How can I “test” whether I want to transition?**

There are many non-permanent changes you can make to get a feel for presenting as male. While you’re doing these things, ask yourself how you like it and how it makes you feel.

Try wearing masculine clothing. Go to a store and try on some pants and shirts that you like. (We’re lucky in that most people won’t bat an eye if a person they perceive as female is wearing traditionally masculine clothing.) If you want to, you can bring a friend. If you don’t want to go out in public, you might be able to try on a family member’s clothes or use an online retailer that allows you to try before buying or that allows simple returns.

Ask a trusted friend or family member to start referring to you with a male name and pronouns.

Consider presenting yourself as male online if you aren’t able to confide in somebody in real life.

Try binding under your clothing and see how it feels. See [Binding](https://www.ftmguide.org/binding.html).

Try getting a more masculine haircut. Be sure to specifically ask the hairdresser for a masculine style cut, and not a pixie cut.
