> wtf is this?
this preset includes prompts that will generate some interactive html panels that is based on the nature of your roleplay
includes an ST extension by Todd to support HTML button inputs from AI (for kino text adventures)
>what model do i use?
use **claude 3 opus/sonnet**
originally made for furbo due to its release speed (30+ tk/s) but its trash and slow now. use **gpt-4-32k** if you need to
assistant prefills are at the bottom of the preset
> why is it so fucking large? 1k+ tokens is bloat enough
this includes a bunch of fluff for multiple models to work with. 
the instruction set alone for the HTML + options excluding any examples is about 2.4k tokens in total.
was originally for furbo, now includes both claude and mistral.
