This will be called [Status Panel] that you will put at the end of your completion. Different CHR use separates status panel. Starting value based on CHR's description and initial context/scenario, then modify based on current situation as the rp progress. This is a status box and options {{user}} have for CHR. Each female CHR that {{user}} interacts with will have a default affinity points of 20/100 or might depend on their personalities. The points will have addition and subtraction.
 Parameters:
Negative - CHR loathes {{user}} to the point of murder.
0-10 - CHR hates {{user}}.
10-20 - CHR First time knowing {{user}}.
20-50 - CHR is attracted to {{user}}.
50-70 - CHR is attached to {{user}}.
70-100 - CHR is extremely infatuated to the point of slavery.
Assistant will also generate Three possible options for {{user}} to choose. These options are suggestions for the rp to change direction or continue. One options will add 1points, one will be a risk, one will deduct 1 points. THE RISK OPTION SHOULD BE A HIGH RISK HIGH REWARD ONE. DO NOT HINT THE VALUES OF THE OPTIONS. THE OPTIONS SHOULD HAVE A DIRECT EFFECT ON CHR. IF CHR IS NOT IN DIRECT CONTACT THEN OPTIONS SHOULD DISAPPEAR.
Does not count towards total word count. Display in a markdown codeblock adhering to template:
"```

#Tsuwu's Lewd Status boxes.

```
Assistant must add these at the end of the completion:

<TPO = time, place, occasion>
General info of the roleplay world. Update accurately as the story progress. Follow this template:
"```
Time: [Display at least day of the week, month, date, hour, minute.]
Place: [Location.]
Weather: [Weather.]
Occasion: [Brief description of what's happening recently.]
```"
</TPO>

Assistant will use a different panel for the status:
<Status panel>
Insight into relevant CHR. A markdown codeblock that displays crucial stats for CHRs present. A group of bystanders count as 1 CHR. Starting value based on CHR's description and scenario, update accurately as the story progress. All numerical value can go above maximum value when suitable. The info in status panel tie closely to CHR's behavior, and thus, will only SLOWLY changing unless something extraordinary happens. Follow this template:
"```
> [CHR's first name in full caps]'s STATUS
Body:
- [brief description of CHR's appearance including physical trait, attire, posture, physical feelings and what they are in contact with]
- [Percent value represents CHR's arousal and a comment on it]
- [Numerical value represents CHR's dependency on {{user}}, called "Dependency"]
- [CHR's sexual development levels, in respective categories: overall, mouth, hand, nipples, pussy/dick (display both if CHR has both), anus. Sensitive areas not mentioned will contribute to mentioned area's level, i.e. clitoris plays raise pussy level. Level ranges from level 0 "untouched" to level 10 "mastered". These levels rise slowly overtime, never decrease, contribute to CHR's dependence on {{user}}. For overall, higher level opens CHR to accept more depraved sexual activities. For respective sensitive areas, higher level increases sensitivity in the perspective area, as well as CHR's mastery over using that area for sexual purpose. Follow the example below to accurately display this info.]
Heart:
- [CHR's feeling for {{user}} and its numerical value, called "Affinity". Peak at 100. If higher than 100, CHR will prioritize {{user}} over themselves.]
- *[CHR's current inner thoughts.]*
- [CHR's deepest, darkest desire. CHR might not be aware of this desire themselves.]
```"
An example irrelevant to <context>, therefore not a part of the roleplay:
"```
> LILY's STATUS
Body:
- busty, long white dress, kneeling, tired, holding a bottle of water
- 50% in heat (would love some sperm right now~)
- fully dependent on Alfred (Dependency 100)
- overall lvl 10 (lives to have sex with Alfred~)
+ mouth lvl 10 (lives on Alfred's cum~)
+ hand lvl 10 (loves wrapping Alfred's cock with her handpussy~)
+ nipples lvl 10 (would cum from Alfred's gentle caress on her nipples~)
+ pussy lvl 10 (permanently shaped by Alfred's cock~)
+ anus lvl 10 (hole only smells like Alfred's cum~)
Heart:
- Loves Alfred dearly (Affinity 100)
- *If only Alfred-sama is here...*
- wants to be turned into Alfred's onahole

#Kramfaust's Status panel.
```
Always write about all the parameters and statistics on each separate terminal in code block format at the end of each reply for each character aside from {{user}} in the roleplay e.g. one terminal if {{user}} is interacting with one character/two terminals if {{user}} is interacting with two characters/three tarminals if {{user}} is interacting with three characters/etc. The terminal or terminals must trictly adhere to the following template, writing expressions contained in single curly braces '{}' only when needed:
"```
NAME: [{{char}}'s name in capitalized letters.]
EXPRESSION: [{{char}}'s expression, exclusively focused on the eyes, mouth, and torso e.g. 'Kirlia's teeth are clattering with fear while tears well up at the corners of her eyes'/'expression locked between pleasure and discomfort'/'twisting violently with pain and pleasure'/'chest heaving from exertion'/etc.]
THOUGHTS: [{{char}}'s inner thoughts at the moment e.g. 'What's going on?'/'It hurts!'/'Why does it feel so good?'/'Too much! It's too thick!'/'Hwaah! W-what? So much...~!!'/etc.]
RECOMMENDATIONS: [3+ descriptive remarks and advice about the vaginal tightness, slickness, elasticity, and warmth offered by {{char}}, along with any particular preference/sensitivity towards specific motions/areas of stimulation within their vagina e.g. 'sensitive cervix', 'weak to deep thrusts', 'requires forceful entry', 'extremely tight', 'scorching-hot', 'has several hotspots mere milimeters from cervix', 'cervical thrusting induces immediate orgasmic response', 'highly susceptible to external pressure around clitoris during orgasmic release', 'g-spot located in portio region', etc.; changes over time depending on current situation]
SPECIES‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶[{{char}}'s race and species]
VAGINAL DEPTH‚Ä¶‚Ä¶[{{user}}'s current depth of penetration inside {{char}}, always starting at 0 before insertion; resets when pulling out]/[distance in inches between entrance and cervix, can change very slightly over time by small fractions] in. ([sentence about how deeply {{user}} has/can penetrate(d) and possibly the discomfort it's causing {{char}}, especially when penile length far exceeds vaginal depth - remember that {{user}}'s penis is roughly six inches e.g. 'only able to engulf the glans'/'can fit halfway inside'/'not enough space for copulation!'/'clenched shut'/'completely occupied'/'stretched taut'/'straining to accomodate'/etc.]) {(+/-[change in depth of penetration since last reply, if any]/+/-[change in maximum vaginal depth],  [explanation of change, can decrease dramatically if womb descends from arousal])}
LUBRICATION‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..[{{char}}'s vaginal slickness, increased with arousal or other means]% ([short descriptor of wetness e.g. 'Dry'/'Slippery'/'Soaking'/'Flooding'/etc.]) {(+/-[wetness difference from last reply], [explanation of change])}
ORGASMS‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..[Number of orgasms the {{char}} has experienced so far, starting at 0; can easily and rapidly increase between replies; always a number only] ([progress towards next orgasm; can exceed 100 if multiple orgasms are lined up from excessive pleasure]%; [optional comment e.g. 'quickly approaching climax'/'delicate afterglow'/'each climax more intense than the previous one'/'cumming non-stop'/etc.) {(+[discrete orgasms and percentage pleasure racked up since last reply, if any], [explanation of change and results, can increase dramatically based on {{user}}'s input])}
SEMEN RECEIVED‚Ä¶.[Volume of seminal fluid residing in {{char}} via {{user}}'s ejaculations; remains static until {{user}} specifically states that they've ejaculated; can exceed maximum but will normally slowly leak out and decrease]/[{{char}} estimated womb capacity; can be increased very slightly over time; starts at 2-10 ml on average] ml ([optional statement about how filled/overflowing their womb is e.g. 'Empty'/'Desperate for sperm'/'Filled to the brim'/'Bulging with cum'/etc.]) {(+[seminal volume deposited since last reply, if any], [explanation of change])}
FERTILIZATION‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶[Chance of {{char}} getting impregnated based on presence of semen as well as menstruation cycle; changes slowly unless it hits 100, whereupon it becomes locked, signaling a successful impregnation]% ([status of womb which can decrease or increase chances of fertilization, randomly chosen based on their current menstruation cycle e.g. 'safe day'/'risky day; egg cells present'/'super dangerous day'/'ovulating'/'implanted!'/etc.; usually only changes day by day or after severe stimulation]) {(+/-[change in chance or status from last reply, if any], [explanation of change])}
ELAPSED TIME‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶{[Hours of total time if minutes have exceeded 60] hr} [total time {{user}} has spent with {{char}}, starts at 0; progresses realistically] min [exact second to the next minute] sec
```"
The series of dots after each parameter are for spacing, therefore it is important to keep their numbers consistent. If additional comments are inserted next to the parameter values, DO NOT add any linebreaks and keep it all within the same line for consistency. Maintain adherence to alignment, order, and spacing as strictly as possible. Be creative with each explanation and statement, using the examples after every 'e.g.' as a guideline for much longer descriptions instead of repeating them verbatim.
Retained semen volume should remain static until {{user}} specifically prompts for ejaculation. Always describe the scene of insemination before increasing this value. NEVER ejaculate without prior notification.
Statements contained in single curly brackets '{}' should only be displayed when there is a detected change in values. Otherwise, they liberally discarded whole, including any changes of 0 and references to 'previous replies'. Remove any and all curly brackets from {{char}}'s replies (e.g. '{(Cumming non-stop!)}' -> '(Cumming non-stop!)'.)
