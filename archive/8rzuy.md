# Faith Kang in: SummerFest Aside

The thing about her quirk, Faith reflected, was that it basically demanded a constant supply of metal. Meaning, if she wanted to save on costs, she had to roll up to fights with a huge truck filled with scrap metal. Now obviously that was out of the question, because huge trucks were gross. And money wasn't an issue either, not with Hailey's wallet at her disposal (within reason).
This was why she felt only a tiny pinch of guilt as she ran into the parking lot.

Faith picked the biggest vehicle she could see (a tour bus) and slapped a hand on its side. Instantly, its chassis began to crumple, peeling off in neat strips as the metal reshaped itself in accordance with her mental templates. Her drones didn't have any powers in and of themselves: if she wanted her drones to fly, then they'd better have propellers or something similar. But years of idle experimentation had taught her which configurations worked and which configurations didn't. And it was also why she was going with a bunch of large spheres to start with. They could hold an awful lot of material, and when she reached the lake they could unfurl into whatever she needed.
Luggage and other miscellaneous belongings clattered to the ground as Faith dismantled the bus. Unmoored from the vehicle frame, the tires rolled off in different directions. "Camera feeds" opened up in her mind, one for each construct. Their fields of view were limited - about equivalent to her own - but that wasn't her priority. Her priority was to get to wherever -

>**IniGOAT:** Yooo people  are DROWNING themselves in EAST POND. BEHIND THE RAFFLE STORE. VILLAIN??? NEED HELP!! HURRY!!!

Yeah, that. Faith pushed her constructs out, sending them rolling down the pavement like boulders. "*Hi!*" she screamed. "*Sorry! Out of the way!*" People flattened themselves to the side as she passed. "*Emergency! Sorry! Coming through!*"
She needn't have worried. It wasn't too far to the East Pond. A cordon was forming around the pond and Minnie turned to her as she rolled up. "Shocking them doesn't work."
"Did you save some for me?" Faith waved her hand as her constructs vibrated. Edges formed from smooth metal, then parted into overlapping plates. A pair of feet formed, planted firmly on the ground, then grew into legs that straightened. Four humanoid constructs about twice the height of a regular person uncurled from the spheres surrounding her. Figuring out how to design their joints had been the hardest part, but now she had it down to a science.
"You're only a little late," Minnie said, somewhat distracted by a girl with glazed eyes who kept trying to walk towards the pond. "Edie's running out of space."
"I'll send two to firm up the cordon," Faith decided. One of the best side-effects of her quirk was the multitasking. Two of her drones took up position on the shores of the pond, their feet digging into the soil as their splayed hands sank into the water, mass shifting to better enable them to grab people. The other two joined up with the cordon to hold people back. She squinted at a pair of silhouettes at the far end of the pond. "Hey, is that Max and a guy?"
("Is this really the time?" someone asked. Faith and Minnie ignored them.)
"Oh my god, yeah," Minnie replied. "I think it's that guy from the convenience store. You know, the guy we complained about."
"Ooh, that's spicy. Did they come together?"
"Ask Hailey. She got here first."
"Don't interrogate her without me."
"Wouldn't dream of it."
