Trans-identifying people with dementia have been observed forgetting their transgender identity and identifying once again with their biological sex, often expressing dismay over their mangled bodies.  Meaning that a person’s identity as their biological sex is immutable to the point that not even dementia can take it away, whereas transgender identity is fleeting and can easily be forgotten.

"The number of referrals to a specialist gender identity unit in Spain increased 10-fold, from 18 in 2012 to 189 in 2021. The rates of increase over time were significantly more pronounced for adolescents and young adults and significantly greater for those assigned female at birth (AFAB). The age of referrals at first visit decreased, and AFAB individuals were, on average ,younger than individuals assigned male birth. The assigned sex ratio favoured AFAB patients among adolescents (2.4:1) and young adults (1.75:1)."

Transgenders and non-binary people were more likely to be associated with bullying and aggressive behaviours than the contrary. This is due to constant vigilance and anticipation of being victimised through the development of hostile or depressive attribution bias thus predisposing transgender youth to detect victimisation by their peers where none was actually intended

Those who "have had it" had a suicide attempt rate of 45%. In every category, those with the lowest suicide attempt rate were those who "do not want it", i.e., those who had not fully embraced medical transition. The 2014 study’s “Do Not Want It” data was promptly removed (not replaced — removed) by a 2019 update of the same study.

>“Gender Affirming Care”
The best and largest research on "gender-affirming care" over 8 years among adolescents have found that there was no improvement in mental health, but a 74% INCREASE in suicidality and "the most pronounced increases in mental healthcare were for adjustment, anxiety, mood, personality, psychotic disorders, and suicidal ideation/attempted suicide"
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34247956/
"Studies presenting the benefits (of sex reassignment through medical intervention) to mental health, including those claiming that the services prevent suicide, are either low or very low quality and rely on unreliable methods such as surveys and retrospective analyses, both of which are cross-sectional and highly biased. Considering the weak evidence supporting the use of puberty suppression, cross-sex hormones, and surgical procedures when compared to the stronger research demonstrating the permanent effects they cause, these treatments do not conform to GAPMS (Generally Accepted Professional Medical Standards) and are experimental and investigational."

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30047834/
Archive Link: https://archive.ph/x8Q0X 
A 2003 study in the New England Journal of Medicine concluded that some kids on drugs like Lupron developed osteopenia and lost too much bone density during a three-year course of treatment to justify the therapy. In other words, the lifetime risk of breaking a bone outweighed the reward of growing a bit taller.

Puberty blockers are irreversible as they have negative impacts on bone density which can cause serious harm to a child's growth
https://www.binary.org.au/new_studies_prove_puberty_blockers_are_not_reversible
Puberty blockers do not alleviate negative thoughts in children with gender dysphoria.
Instead, children experienced reduced growth in height and bone strength by the time they finished treatment.

Cross-sex hormones affect the brain to some extent which is where the myth of trans brains comes from. Trans brains are not real, it is actually hormones influencing the brain enough to confuse the measures and be abused in research by trans activists.

CMS analysed 33 studies on sex reassignment surgery and found that "the results were inconsistent, but negative in the best studies"
And
"After careful assessment, we identified six studies that could provide useful information (Figure 1). Of these, the four best designed and conducted studies that assessed quality of life before and after surgery using validated (albeit non-specific) psychometric studies did not demonstrate clinically significant changes or differences in psychometric test results after GRS. (Heylens et al., 2014; Ruppin, Pfafflin, 2015; Smith et al., 2005; Udeze et al., 2008) (Appendix C Panel A and Appendix G.)"

Persons with transsexualism, after sex reassignment, have considerably higher risks for mortality, suicidal behavior, and psychiatric morbidity. Findings suggest that sex reassignment, although alleviating gender dysphoria, may not suffice as treatment for transsexualism

"The most thorough follow-up of sex-reassigned people — extending over thirty years and conducted in Sweden, where the culture is strongly supportive of the transgendered — documents their lifelong mental unrest. Ten to fifteen years after surgical reassignment, the suicide rate of those who had undergone sex-reassignment surgery rose to twenty times that of comparable peers." - Dr. Paul McHugh, former Johns Hopkins Psychiatrist in Chief

Sources on the advantages men have when participating in female sports. To avoid confusion: "man" refers to a real man, "transman" refers to a woman who identifies as a man. "Woman" refers to a real woman, "transwoman" refers to a man who identifies as a woman.
After transwomen (i.e. biological men) and transmen (i.e. biological women) both underwent 12 months of cross sex hormone therapy, transwomen still ended up being stronger than transmen, in both absolute and height adjusted values

Trans Genocide MYTH
Only 32 transgender people have been killed in the US in 2022. The trans murder rate is about 2.

In contrast the estimated murder rate in 2022 for the general population is 6.45. Thus trans people are 3 times less likely to be killed than the average American.
