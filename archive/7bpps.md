## Femanon contracts Macro-werevixenism

>it starts with a heavy sweat as you spot the full moon outside
>a tingling shoots through you
>the tiny, fine hairs all over your body sprout and thicken
>darker around the hands and feet
>white along your belly and chest
>orange elsewhere
>your palms and the soles of your feet toughen and harden
>a coarseness that concentrates on these patches
>then hairs sprout between them
>they’re pads
>the changes don’t stop there
>the bones in your feet change
>a dull pain as they creak and extend
>the nails crack and fall away, leaving sharp pointed claws
>you realise your feet are digitigrade paws
>you moan as the thickening hair on your body overtakes any visible skin
>leaving you covered in a luscious layer of fur
>your ears twitch and push higher on your head, pointing through your foxish orange hair
>and your face suffers a dull ache, that makes your eyes water, and your nose darkens
>your teeth reform and grow sharper even as your jaw stretches out
>and you fail to hold back a grin as you smell things you couldn’t before
>with a light yelp, you lean forward as your back tingles and stretches
>the you hold your hips as the forgotten, vestigial stub above your butt gains life
>and you giggle as a fluffy, wagging tail sprouts
>you finally see yourself in the mirror
>standing before you is… a vixen
>it’s an improvement
>but merely you in shape besides these animalistic traits
>but the moon fills you with purpose, and energy
>and arousal
>your hand instinctually reaches for your breast
>you even hurt yourself as you bite your lip with your new, sharper canines as you gently squeeze your tit
>yet it fights back, growing heavier and fuller against your padded palm
>soon overwhelming it, overfilling your ability to cup it
>and your other hand feels your belly
>already softer thanks to the smooth, silky white fur, something else shifts
>you feel a raw heat and moan as the moon’s power floods you
>your thighs thicken
>your biceps swell
>and your hand feels light grooves that only grow deeper, until you rub and feel the contradiction of fur and hard, unyielding abs
>the vixen in the mirror looks more formidable
>hotter, curvier, *stronger*
>you notice your eyes aren’t your natural colour
>they’re yellow
>they begin to glow, as the moon is relentless in your changes
>a deep, almost electric surge runs through your whole body
>you can barely keep yourself from plunging your fingers deep inside yourself as you feel it
>the ground seems to ‘pinch’ together under your digitigrade paws
>the ceiling looms lower upon you
>the everyday things around you seem lesser
>just all this raw power flooding you and spreading throughout your new, better you
>you’re growing
>becoming bigger
>the floor creaks as your weight increases
>things you know that would support you seem too weak
>the room itself becomes cramped
>you don’t care
>you just want to be *more*
>just keep growing!
>you press your hands against the ceiling
>then you drop down into your ass
>the room shakes to such a petty gesture as sitting on your full, thick, rounded and fuzzy ass
>you’re so powerful!
>your new tail knocks over a table
>your paws push against the wall
>a thing to protect you, to grant you privacy, now cracks and crumbles against your feet
>your back presses against the opposite side
>you’re filling the room!
>you’re so fucking *big!*
>and still you’re growing!
>your hands crash through into the other rooms
>your head bursts through the ceiling
>and your paws smash through into the cold air outside as the room gives way
>you’re now outside and naked, and you don’t give a damn
>the moonlight on your fur sends you into such an overwhelming growth spurt, you cry out in bliss
>the buildings, trees and people around you fall away
>until nothing reaches even your knee
>and the ground quakes and splinters as you take your first step as a macro vixen
>and everyone’s staring, afraid of what you might do
>all you do is glance up to the moon and wonder
>… how much bigger could you become?
