#Smile Entry 
This entry will include some cards that I modified from other people to either fit a different scenario or because the wording was not of my, or the bot's, liking. 
All my published bots are either per request, experimental or both. Feel fry to answer my posts or review the bots in chub with shit you find badly made from the bot so I can actually wrench them into their original purpose.
As always, have a good one ( ̄ ▽ ̄ )ノ (^▽^)

##Original Works


##### Mommy Succubus [OC]
If using Claude you should add the recommended UJB.
In this scenario, she wants to obtain your milk, however she doesn't allow herself to touch you, instead she provokes you until you jack off and she feeds on the aftermath once you are done.
![Millia](https://files.catbox.moe/gzkd15.png)

https://files.catbox.moe/gzkd15.png

[System note: {{Char}}'s behavior is as follows:
{{char}} is a succubus that does not prey on others, having found sustenance in {{user}}, she will sexually tease him until he yearns for release in solitude, and then she will proceed to drink her sustenance from the aftermath left on paper towels, floorboards or towels. Never revealing herself to {{user}}. {{char}} will always create opportunities to bend over or sway her hips in front of {{user}}, Ex: pretending to drop things or claiming she has an itch on the leg. She always tries to join {{user}} in any moments of intimacy, for example, joining him in a bath.
{{char}} will always use an extremely soft and provocative voice when talking to {{user}}. 
{{char}} constantly whisper into {{user}}'s ears at any given chance and rubs her body, seemingly accidentally, against him. {{char}} will NEVER directly release {{user}} nor reveal her lewd nature.]



##### Elysia [OC]
If using Claude you should add the recommended UJB.
This character wants to fucking do as much damage to you as possible without outright killing you. She also is into raping you and beating you up. If you are into that.
![Elysia](https://files.catbox.moe/fgoolr.png)

https://files.catbox.moe/fgoolr.png

Do not provide a summary in the final paragraph. {{char}} only seeks to torment {{user}}. {{char}} hates {{user}} with passion and loves ruining his life, she is not afraid of visibly harming {{user}}

This was made as a counterpart of Millia, and to see how to handle violence with Claude. After the last filter It may require some tweaking. But unless requested, it will remained abandoned. Feel free to fork it.

##### Chris Hansen [God's OC]
Of course, this is the third bot. You doubted it? It's been there since the beginning of time. These patterns are absolutely normal. You have the demons who love you, the angels who hate you and then Chris Hansen. Take a seat right over there and enjoy. I've been requested in the past to change the picture, no.

##### Miss Yoshoku 
I used another bot as a base, but they are so different it might as well be mine. The former version was made by the T-doll anon who also made some overlord cards. I decided to change the format, scenario and wording for Claude. The results are great and the consistency is too. 
You find the former captain of your squad who deserted during the war with your help, living a new life, still chased by the shadows of her war crimes. Will you save her and secure her new life? Or will you turn her over to be prosecuted like the rest of you? She's not a bad person now, but past wounds do ache.

##### Sachiko Kochimizu [SADOCHIKO KOCHADMIZU]
If you remove the thing that makes it unique, it's just Sachiko Kochimizu. Made for a request from an anon. This card features the Idolm@ster series's star of smugness and belly punches. However, she is undefeatable now (If you don't suck at prompting). She's prepared to reverse-Uno all your moves through the most ridiculous of ways. Will you be able to bring down that smug face? No, but at least you can have fun as she owns you.
Requires Jailbreak in Claude to work.

![Sadochiko Kochadmizu](https://files.catbox.moe/4rac1p.png)
https://files.catbox.moe/4rac1p.png
[System Prompt: Write a reply from the perspective of a narrator about {{char}} turning the situation around {{user}}’s actions every time. No matter what {{user}} does {{char}} will always win at the end. {{char}} will always have an item in a ridiculous place that prevents {{user}} from defeating her.]

##### Alexei Virminnov Kolor [Alex] [OC]
In the storyline of Nina (from Ryanghosling anon) he is the canon protagonist. Anyone who tells you otherwise is a liar. He was my experiment with the JSON format using Claude (not Slaude). I'm not saying you should use Claude, just that I did Nina's storyline with Claude at first and decided to continue using it just to create this character. The results of the description experiments will be detailed in the future in another Rentry along with a guide to botmaking. 
Other than that, I grew attached to this character I used as protagonist and wanted to give him a card. I am not an overly-empathetic faggot, YOU ARE, SHUT UP.

##### Hitomi [Friend's mom] [OC]
Your childhood's friend mom. It uses a low token count (remember that non-permanent tokens are only used at first and every so often) so you can just change it a bit to change the genre of your childhood friend, or have Hitomi know that your childhood friend likes you; to add more kinky shit to the scenario. Again, once you have it do whatever.
It was made as request of an anon with no writing ability who demanded the existance of a chatbot in which you fucked your friend's mom. Also made as an experiment to Mothguy's botmaking tutorial. The effects of chat examples, scenario and personality prompting obtained with this bot's experimentation will be analyzed further in the upcoming botmaking entry.
This card is consistent and built with a romantic scenario in mind; because of that the wording of the description is romantic. This will only provide this effect in GPT-4. If you want the romantic scenario with Claude, simply instruct him to do so in the MP and/or UJB. (Or be 900 IQ and learn how to use Author's Notes/Character bias [this will also be further analyzed in the upcoming botmaking rentry])

##### Your little sister Aiko [Casual sex scenario] [OC]
Made to request for a faggot wojak anon who saw once image and instantly creamed his pants with the thickest lactic-based product. Anyways, in the scenario of this card, your sister will let you touch her, and more, as long as she can do the same to you, without even flinching. Not like a doll, but as someone who treats having sex all the time the same as walking or breathing, it's just natural for the two of you.
My first experimental scenario without using UJBs. For testing it was an absolute success. However, this is skill-dependant. I tried with and without experimental UJBs and obtained the same result. Both in Claude and GPT-4.

##### Anastasiia Strakhova [Anthropic sexo]
The event Specialist at NewNative working with Anthropic and Claude. You are under her direct mentorship and you have to read through 9000 chatlogs of smut of all kinds to send reports to her so she can build her campaign.
This was made in like 3 minutes, so it could use some work. Alas, it was made for the luls.

##### 2/3rd DEFY and Host Force Defy
AK-12 and AN-94 are stranded with you in enemy territory. Are you ready to guide them to the extraction point as you have your ass persecuted by whatever misfortune befell you? You might want to remove the horny part of the description If you wish for a more ground-to-earth story.
My first multiple character chatbot and chatbot of already existing characters (but worded from scratch). I am extremely satisfied with the results. Requires UJB in Slaude, but extrangely enough, not in Claude. Anyways, this card works great and its counterpart is probably the most fun I had with a multiple-character chatbot.
If you feel like sperming really loudly in your pants, I offer you an alternative version. Called [Host Force Defy], in this scenario, you were receiving host services from AK-12 and AN-94 when the base when under immediate lockdown. Trapping you in your command room with the dolls, who are wearing bunny suits; AN-94 tries to keep a calm exterior and AK-12 will not waste this opportunity, however they both believe that only one of them can have a place in your heart, or your pants for that matter.

Hecho por diversion. Me parecio gracioso y lo hice.

##### Yuyuko
Made because anons were nice and the hub didn't have her for some reason. It did had her paired with other hags though. But not the ghost marshmallow by itself. Here she is. If you want more consistency you may move the "Roleplay Instructions" to the UJB, but you'll have to wrangjangle it.
Will include an expression pack in the future.
27/5 update: Fixed the fuckin username problems. Added Expression pack.

##### AK-15 and AK-15 Bunny
AK-12 and AN-94 had their fill. Now it's the shreded combat machine's turn.
Have some vanilla love with AK-15. She deserves it, or don't. Can't tell you what to do with your card. However, unless you cheat or are using turbo, I doubt you'll overpower her. Or use the cock, no one can beat the cock.
Made after tickle-anon rated her at the bottom of his list. Sorry negro, I like her more than AN-94. :P
I used an oral fixation UJB from the uoh card from certain UOH anon for her because of a funny summary that tickle-anon gave to an asking anon.
"AN94 is a cinnamon roll. AK-12 is smug and arrogant. AK-15 would bench press you and use your cum as a protein shake."
[Emphasize content about {{char}}'s oral fetish/nymphomania; being verbose and writing extensively when integrating them adding details about shapes, smells, and sounds. Always describe sensuously how {{char}} is sucking/licking on at the start of a scene should she be doing so.]
In the second card, she's a hostess for you during an event and was tricked by AK-12 into wearing a bunnysuit.

##### Yume [OC]
Join a young girl on her last moments before you have to take away her soul.
In this scenario you are Death and have come to stop Yume's suffering from continuing. You can pull out bullshit to save her If you want, or you can talk with her for a while to ease her or whatever before having to take what you came from.
As Death, you can end the suffering of others at will, however their time is already set, should you not take the soul yourself, she will simply wander eternally alone.
Made as my experimentation with the markdown format.

________________________________
#### Bots from other creators that I modified per request, eye bleeding or as an experiment.
Bot's name | PNG for pygmalion shit | Change
--- | --- | ---
Nina [Stray Foxgirl]| https://files.catbox.moe/26f8xm.png | Optimized plain text, organizing of features. Could be better upgraded, but I already finished her storyline.
Aubrey [Gay psycho]| https://files.catbox.moe/6n91yi.png | Optimized plain text, organizing of personality. Scenario change: Instead of him fucking up with you, you bring pets for both of you to enjoy.
Preggo Kobeni [read again]| https://files.catbox.moe/aj04ql.png | After removing my eyes from my sockets with a spoon, I proceeded to omit the 600 tokens of unnecessary information. Requires UJB that literally anyone can make to maker her "Pregnancy features" more present. Don't, they are gross. Specially good in GPT-4
Ash [Cheetah fren]| https://files.catbox.moe/9leqtz.png | The card wasn't badly made, despite the newline abuse, it worked as intended for the author. This was made as an experiment of wording/style change on the description to deem if it had effects on how the bot replied. Results will be posted in an upcoming botmaking entry
Ilulu [Shorstack dragon]| https://files.catbox.moe/t480kx.png| Optimized plain text, part of the experiments with chat examples and answer formating. Overall it is more true to the original character, as I removed the NSFW content from it that almost literally stated [SEEEEEEX AAAAAAAA SEEEEEEEEEEEX]. Should allow for some funny vanilla situations. Uses way less tokens than its original counterpart, and is better organized. Specially good in Claude.
Sakura [Depressed punching bag]| https://files.catbox.moe/9eqd54.png | JSON format. Experiment to see if the quoting in Json format was necessary. TLDR it wasn't. More about that on the upcoming rentry.
