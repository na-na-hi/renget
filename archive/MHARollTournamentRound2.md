>SAWBONES VS CONMAN
Sawbones: 20, 9, 8
Conman: 3, 7, 8

For the first match of Round 2, Sawbones is going up against Conman! Conman attemps to fool Sawbones with an illusion of a patient over a conveniently placed red X, directly under a hanging safe, but Sawbones doesn't fall for it! The turncoat walks over and stabs Conman with a scalpel, giving him 32 stab wounds.
With his dying breath, Conman remarks that he really thought the red X idea would work.

Honestly, I don't really care about either of these guys...

Stand proud Conman, you were strong.

>FLOOR VS ICHIMAKI
Floor: 15, 10, 7
Ichimaki: 14, 15, 15

Ichimaki went *SHWING* and Floor was like *AHHHH* and then Ichimaki went *HEHEHEHE* and Floor's head went *WOOSH* and then it went *PLOP* and then Ichimaki went *HEHEHEHE*, again.
U.A beats SHITketsu again! Maybe, I don't know what a Floor is. I think he's in love with Smokin' Sexy or something? He's with his lover now.

Behind the scenes, NotMio- uh, I mean, Seto Kawata or whatever his name is seethes.

"I'll have you killed yet, U.A Student!"

Stand proud Floor, you were strong.

>ORBIT VS BLACKOUT
Orbit: 12, 15, 11
The Sweeper: 20, 13, 5

It's JOEVER.
It's SO FUARKING JOEVER.
IT'S NEVER BEEN MORE JOEVER THAN THIS.

Honestly, I'm pissed. I don't even know this Orbit retard's deal and he ended the **#ASHLEIGHSWEEP**.

Ashleigh screams "**#ASHLEIGHSWEEP**" at the top of her lungs, but Orbit is a cheating little bitch and brought earplugs. Orbit then turned Ashleigh into some splattered pieces.
Then the janitor begins his own *#ASHLEIGHSWEEP*.

Stand proud Ashleigh, you swept.

>GOLDORADO VS ISABELA
Where's that smacktalk, Saurusanon? Still waiting.
Goldenballs: 15, 2, 2
Isabela: 11, 1, 4

Man...
This sucks.
That was such a crappy roll and Isabela seriously couldn't beat that???

Goldenballs ALMOST gets hit with a raygun, and while Isabela (who thinks she won) is talking about Arenas again, he comes up from behind her and snaps her neck.

Ugh, I gotta make this more interesting...
Oh, I know!

Goldenballs takes off his mask and BOOM it's DANCE-WITH-RAIN BABYYYYYY!

"I WILL ALWAYS FIND YOU, BRETON! GAHAHAHAHA!"

...What do you mean he wouldn't say that?

Stand proud Isabela, you were strong.

>JACK DUNN VS SETO KAWATA
Robocop: 15, 11, 19
U.A Mio: 17, 19, 20

Damn, that's a high roll!
I'm kinda rooting for NotMio, no one else who's interesting is left.

Jack Dunn tries to shoot Mio, but since only Crystals can pierce Mios, the bullets simply bounce right off.
Then a giant plant monster grabs Jack.

"It appears my little friend has to LEAF you a question!"
"Wait, shit, I messed that up."

Then the plant monster squishes Jack Dunn into a meatball.

"MWAHAHAHA! I'M COMING FOR YOU, U.A STUDENT!"

Stand proud Saucy Jack, you were strong.
