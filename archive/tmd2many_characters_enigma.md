### Lady Enigma
Lady Enigma was the middle child of a few siblings under the current patriarch of House Oasis, Lord Sitrus. However, when her father fell suddenly ill, he named her the primary inheritor of his riches and estate. Finding oneself thrust into politics in shady fashion would ordinarily be cause for panic with most Pokemon, but not Lady Enigma, who wholeheartedly embraces the controversy surrounding her ascension, and leverages her background in theater and song to leave an impression among the courts.
