->I tend to do bots in bursts, so don't expect the list to update frequently. Forgive me for being lazy.<-

-> 08/08 - SO, I got a bunch of OCs at the ready. But I promised myself to release them in an equal amount of Nikke cards to motivate myself to create them. But the main issue is: I like Nikke too much. I open the game to double-check the defs/lore and end up getting lost on playing.
My bad.
P.S. My score on the Barbeque Minigame is 10,400.<-

-> 06/29 - NIKKE Lorebook released in a raw, unfinished state. After several crashes with the lorebook not saving, I decided to release it without the characters. I urge (you) to send feedback on it as this is my first time creating a lorebook. Apologies for the wait. <-

->Feel free to send feedback, logs, or whatever in the thread<-
