The gullible aura that surrounds Sam has been upgraded and blended in with his other abilities to make him more unassuming to his recipients. While active his words don't stand out, whatever he'll say will sound normal whether he wants to or not. It basically makes it so he's better at hiding in the crowd socially.

>Life Skills?
Job x2 -15s, -10l
* Works as an assistant to multiple people in top positions.

Athletics -10s, -5l
Spider's Web x2 +10s, -20l
* His connections either come from his Family's legacy in Dunwich or from his own connections that he's built from work.

Social Butterfly x2 -5s, -10l
Firearm Training (Hunting Rifles) -10s, -5l
Outdoors Survival -10s, -5l
Specialist (Law 2), (Finance 2) -30l
* Being the secretary of a few rather shady bosses practically necessitates having a fair bit of knowledge on both subjects. If he wasn't world class in both subjects by the time things started to happen he'd lose his job. But in the end something else came to those very bosses.


>Possessions?
Safe House -12.5l
* The family mansion. A large house with a garage and numerous bedrooms and ballrooms that's located around the neighborhood area. 

Vehicle (Medium) x2 -10l
* 2 different vehicles. The first is the car he bought with his own money. A simple 4 seater that's reliable but a bit slow. It was recently featured in a crash so it might need a few repairs. The second is a hand-me-down luxury car. A bit old but runs well when it isn't sputtering from time to time.

Gadgets (Normal), (Custom), (Great) -15l
* Normal gadgets that one might need such as binoculars, flashlights, or swiss army knives.
* The custom gadget of his choice is a simple tazer hidden under his sleeves. A few run ins with some very bad people made sure to keep his safety against the real monsters a top priority.
* A great gadget that comes in the form of a high end laptop. With how often companies change their hardware towards the newer, shinier upgrade, it was easy to collect a few higher end models for relatively no charge.

Firearm (Heavy) -7.5l
* Grandpa's rifle from the war. Though unspecified and with the numbers removed it still acts as reliably as it did while in service. Just a simple bolt action rifle with the standard ironsights.

Protective Suit (Light Protection) -2.5l
Personal Radio Station -5l
Survival Supply -2.5l

>Life Events
Summer Vacation -10s
Psychological Help -10t, -20s, +15l
* He's been seeking a therapist even before his accidental death. A strange combination of both imposter syndrome and inferiority complex has transformed into a strange mental state he can't seem to escape from. Wanting to both blend in with others and stay away from the spotlight, but also live up or even surpass the his family's name. 

Old Money (Deep Drive) -10s, +15l

>Cause of Death? (+17t, +5s, +75l)
>So what do we know about the kid?
His name is [Samuel Barker], age 23. Lives in [The Central City] and works as a secretary. Witnesses say they saw his car at the side of I95 face first into one of the trees by the road side with him somehow outside the car at a nearby bush. Man's lucky. Could've been an [Accidental Death], especially with whatever goes on in those woods. Reports only go until 6:00pm and nobody saw a car, or smoke, or anything suspicious by the side of the road while passing through.

>Ship of Theseus
>How is he then? (-7t)
Barely responsive. Condition is stable but he's still experiencing trauma from the crash. There's a [Fear] in his eyes, like the worst case of [Phobia] a man could experience. All mumble was something about needing to [Escape]. Whatever it is, he's clearly too [Delusion]al for an interrogation. Whatever [This Illusion] is, he better snap out of it quick. Might be connected to the same case in the area. Hopefully he ain't the dripping with [Narcissism +] type. You know how rich folks in the city are.

>Life Skills? (-40s, -55l)
>How about we start off simple, remember your daily routine? Any hobbies of the sort?
Uh, yeah. I guess I'm a bit of an outdoorsy person. Got a bit [Athletic] from hiking every now and then. Helps me remember those days outside the city with grandpa. Taught me about some [Outdoors Survival] while hunting as a kid. Even gave me a bit of [Firearm Training] with his trusty hunting rifle. Or at least I try to hike every now and then. Got a few [Job]s I work at so everyday's a mess. At least it got me a few connections. I'm a bit of a [Social Butterfly] so I've got a whole [Spider's Web] of connections from each of my previous jobs.

>Possessions? (-50l)
>Can you give me a run down of your possessions? We'll be needing it for the insurance.
I've got another property around the neighborhood area. It's a relatively [Safe House] with a few [vehicle]s parked outside. A few [Gadgets], grandpa's old [Firearm] from the war. This rather [Protective Suit] I've worn for a while now. A [Personal Radio Station] made from a bunch of junk at the house. Maybe some [Survival Supply] from when I go hiking?..

> Retrieved from a transcript of Sam's [Psychological Help] sessions.
Yeah... after all of that now all I have left is grandma, grandpa, and a sibling in another state away. I remember during [Summer Vacation] I'd always go out to my grandparent's cabin. We'd do all sorts of outdoor activities, he'd even teach me a few lessons about life. It's been so long, and I miss him. I miss going back there, I still wish I could. I really miss that old place, but someone's gotta take care of that [Old Money]. Almost every O'brien has lived out their life in Dunwich, probably going to be the only one to do so for this generation.

>Shadow Thresholds
The Average Joe (0s)
>Can you tell us what happened?
Ah... um, of course. It's just that- I, s-sorry. it's all just a bit, fuzzy... So I was driving back home, the dashboard clock was at 9:45 I think? I was a bit drowsy at the time so I can't recall exactly when it happened. Anyway, I was driving down the road, blurry vision from being tired, and then I saw it. I mean, I saw a deer crossing the road. Yeah. Just a regular deer. You guys should really put up a sign or something. Maybe even put reflectors on its antlers or something...
It wasn't a deer though. The night he died he encountered a beast on the road. Hungry, ravenous, it was a hulking mass that was still dripping from a fresh meal.

Sam's just a normal guy in every sense of the word. Started out as an accountant until he got recognized enough to be promoted to the secretary. Since then he's been bouncing from boss to boss until he ended up here back at Dunwich, back in his old neighborhood. He never really liked the Old Money his family was attached to. He always preferred his father's side to the reverence that came with being an O'brien. It brought him fame, money, connections, sure but he could always get that on his own, and he did. Rented an apartment in the city and works to cover the payments for both. Eventually the night of the attack had arrived and after his recovery he went back to his old routine. Being terrorized by the supernatural isn't going to help him pay for his bills, nor his therapist. It turns out one of the greatest horrors of this world is the ones we've created for ourselves, namely taxes. He's still rather oblivious to the supernatural, but he'll help out a few of his fellow Dead Men should they need a few calls or coins. After all he's been bumping into them and the supernatural often very recently.
